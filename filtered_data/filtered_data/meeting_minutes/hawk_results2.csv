"It was noted that much of the stimulus for the strong expansion in the first half of the year had been provided by large increases in spending for consumer durables, housing, and business equipment; however, growth in such spending could be expected to slow in the context of increasingly satisfied pent-up demands and the lagged effects of earlier increases in intermediate- and long-term interest rates on these interest-sensitive sectors of the economy.",1996-08-20,HAWKISH,0.9727527499198914

"With regard to the outlook for wages, members observed that, though it was too early to reach a firm judgment, the acceleration of wage increases this year might well augur faster advances that were more in line with historical experience under essentially full employment conditions.",1996-08-20,HAWKISH,0.931787371635437
"On balance, the inflation risks in the outlook clearly seemed to be to the upside, with the potential for more inflation stemming from rising labor compensation costs augmented by a rise in the minimum wage and the prospect of higher food prices and perhaps energy prices over the next several quarters.",1996-08-20,HAWKISH,0.9888317584991455
"In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, members focused on indications that the economy already was slowing, perhaps by enough to limit pressures on resources, and they noted that broad statistical measures of prices and the anecdotal evidence did not suggest that a pickup in inflation was already under way.",1996-08-20,DOVISH,0.586738646030426

Such a development could have serious adverse consequences for economic activity if the expansion was in fact already slowing to a more sustainable and less inflationary pace.,1996-08-20,HAWKISH,0.9730927348136902
"At the same time, it was emphasized that the Committee remained committed to a policy that would resist a rise in inflation; such a policy would entail moving in anticipation of greater price pressures and before they showed through to actual inflation.",1996-08-20,HAWKISH,0.9900555610656738
Such a directive would imply that any tightening should be implemented promptly if developments were perceived as pointing to rising inflation.,1996-08-20,HAWKISH,0.9739586114883423
"For now, the Committee should remain particularly vigilant to incoming information bearing on the outlook for inflation.",1996-08-20,DOVISH,0.640345573425293

The widespread application of technological advances and the associated surge in outlays for capital equipment had been fostering an acceleration in labor productivity that seemed to be ongoing.,2000-08-22,DOVISH,0.5928595662117004
"Data on productivity and capital accumulation that had become available in recent months had tended to confirm these trends, and the statistical evidence was reinforced by comments from many business executives and by persistent upward revisions to long-term profit forecasts, which had yet to suggest a leveling out of productivity growth.",2000-08-22,HAWKISH,0.5283564925193787
Quickening productivity had been the fundamental factor behind the economy's remarkable performance in recent years.,2000-08-22,DOVISH,0.794863224029541
"Members noted, however, that historical episodes involving major changes in productivity trends had been rare and the past therefore provided a limited basis for evaluating the course of future productivity developments.",2000-08-22,DOVISH,0.9603649377822876

Another source of uncertainty related to the interactions of rising productivity and aggregate demand.,2000-08-22,DOVISH,0.9407015442848206
"Over the course of recent years, accelerating productivity gains had tended to boost aggregate demand by even more than potential aggregate supply owing to the effects of stronger profits on investment spending and, through the rising stock market, on consumption as well.",2000-08-22,HAWKISH,0.9579001069068909
"However, the leveling out in stock prices this year suggested that recent increases in productivity growth had been built into market expectations and prices some time ago and were not likely to provide the same impetus to demand going forward as had past productivity acceleration.",2000-08-22,DOVISH,0.8779669404029846
"Members cautioned nonetheless that the possibility that long-term interest rates and equity prices did not yet adequately reflect ongoing productivity gains could not be ruled out, with attendant effects boosting demand.",2000-08-22,DOVISH,0.511401891708374
"Finally, rising productivity clearly had been a major force in containing inflation in a period of unusually low unemployment rates, and while some of the interactions between productivity growth and wages and prices could be adduced, these interactions involved complex processes that were very difficult to assess given the paucity of prior experience.",2000-08-22,DOVISH,0.9299225211143494

The clearest evidence of softening consumer demand tended to be concentrated in sales of motor vehicles and in housing-related durable goods.,2000-08-22,NEUTRAL,0.8380149006843567
Available data on reduced growth in consumer spending were supported by anecdotal reports of some slippage in retail sales below expectations in several parts of the country.,2000-08-22,NEUTRAL,0.9792304635047913
"Factors underlying these developments included diminishing wealth effects after several months of limited changes in equity prices, the cumulative buildup in the stock of motor vehicles and other consumer durables owned by the public, and the constraining effects of higher energy prices on incomes available to be spent on other goods and services.",2000-08-22,HAWKISH,0.9832003116607666
"While these factors might well continue to damp the growth of consumer spending going forward, members noted that consumer confidence remained at a high level, consumer incomes were rising, and no anecdotal or other evidence pointed to any marked deterioration in consumer spending that would pose a potential threat to the sustainability of the economic expansion.",2000-08-22,DOVISH,0.9155371189117432
"The housing sector provided the clearest indication of a response of aggregate demand to firming interest rates, affecting industries producing construction materials and household furnishings.",2000-08-22,HAWKISH,0.964491605758667
"Factors helping to explain the softness in housing, which included the rise that had occurred in mortgage interest rates and reported overbuilding in some metropolitan areas, were expected to continue to exert some downward pressure on housing activity.",2000-08-22,NEUTRAL,0.8188754916191101

"The strengthening economies of many U. S. trading partners were fostering rising demand for U. S. exports, a trend that seemed likely to persist according to reports from many domestic business contacts.",2000-08-22,HAWKISH,0.4855681359767914
"Nonetheless, the nation's current account deficit apparently continued to increase, a development about which members expressed concern in view of the risks that it posed for the foreign exchange value of the dollar and domestic inflation over time.",2000-08-22,HAWKISH,0.9894285798072815
"In the Committee's discussion of the outlook for inflation, members noted that overall measures of price inflation had picked up to fairly high levels by the standards of recent years, largely as a result of higher energy costs.",2000-08-22,HAWKISH,0.9777462482452393
"Still, core consumer price indices remained relatively damped and had risen only a little over the last year, especially when measured by the PCE chain-price index, and that suggested underlying price pressures remained largely contained.",2000-08-22,DOVISH,0.5950459837913513
"Nonetheless, a number of members were concerned that unusually taut labor markets could begin at some point to show through to increases in labor compensation in excess of productivity gains, pressuring unit costs and prices.",2000-08-22,HAWKISH,0.9820858240127563
"Evidence of this had yet to emerge, perhaps because productivity continued to accelerate, but a flattening out of the rate of increase in productivity, even at a high level, could well pose at some point a risk to continued favorable inflation performance.",2000-08-22,HAWKISH,0.8431442975997925
"To be sure, there were a number of positive factors in the outlook for inflation, including highly competitive conditions in many markets, stable and relatively favorable expectations with regard to the longer-run inflation outlook, and signs that the remarkable acceleration in productivity was continuing.",2000-08-22,DOVISH,0.8179733753204346
"On balance, however, the members saw a mild upward trend in key measures of inflation as a distinct possibility, albeit one that was subject to considerable uncertainty.",2000-08-22,HAWKISH,0.9042617082595825
"In their assessment of factors leading to this decision, the members focused on the further evidence that moderating demand and accelerating productivity were closing the gap between the growth of aggregate demand and potential supply, even before earlier Committee tightening actions had exerted their full restraining effects.",2000-08-22,HAWKISH,0.9876033663749695
"While the recent rally in domestic financial markets could be viewed as having partially eroded the degree of monetary restraint implemented earlier, real interest rates for private borrowers were still at relatively elevated levels, banking institutions were continuing to report further tightening of their standards and terms for business loans, equity prices had risen only modestly, and the dollar had firmed over recent months.",2000-08-22,HAWKISH,0.909523606300354
"In addition, the last few readings on core inflation had not suggested a further upward drift, unit labor costs were not increasing, and longer-term inflation expectations had been stable for some time.",2000-08-22,DOVISH,0.8902451992034912
"Accordingly, the Committee incurred little risk in leaving the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting and waiting to see how the various factors affecting both supply and demand in the economy unfolded and influenced the prospects for economic activity and prices.",2000-08-22,DOVISH,0.9760938286781311
"At the same time, many members emphasized that the Committee needed to be prepared to act promptly should inflationary pressures appear to be intensifying, and in the Committee's discussion of the balance-of-risks sentence to be included in the press statement that would be issued after this meeting, all the members agreed that the sentence should continue to indicate that the risks to the economy remained weighted toward higher inflation in the foreseeable future.",2000-08-22,HAWKISH,0.9932737350463867
"While the members did not expect underlying inflation to intensify materially, especially over the nearer term, the statement was intended to express their views about the longer term, and over that horizon they agreed that the risks lay in the direction of price acceleration.",2000-08-22,HAWKISH,0.9771900773048401

"Information from bank contacts as well as a survey of banks indicated that, in an environment in which money market interest rates were very close to the interest rate paid on excess reserve balances, banks would likely be comfortable operating with much lower levels of reserve balances than at present but would wish to maintain substantially higher levels of balances than before the crisis.",2018-11-08,NEUTRAL,0.4387796223163605

The staff highlighted how changes in the determinants of reserve demand since the crisis could affect the tradeoffs between two types of operating regimes: (1) one in which aggregate excess reserves are sufficiently limited that money market interest rates are sensitive to small changes in the supply of reserves and (2) one in which aggregate excess reserves are sufficiently abundant that money market interest rates are not sensitive to small changes in reserve supply.,2018-11-08,DOVISH,0.9706262350082397

"In the latter type of regime, money market interest rates are not sensitive to small fluctuations in the demand for and supply of reserves, and the stance of monetary policy is instead transmitted from the Federal Reserve's administered rates to market rates--an approach that has been effective in controlling short-term interest rates in the United States since the financial crisis, as well as in other countries where central banks have used this approach.",2018-11-08,DOVISH,0.9831114411354065

"Participants cited several potential benefits of targeting the OBFR rather than the EFFR: The larger volume of transactions and greater variety of lenders underlying the OBFR could make that rate a broader and more robust indicator of banks' overnight funding costs, the OBFR could become an even better indicator after the potential incorporation of data on onshore wholesale deposits, and the similarity of the OBFR and the EFFR suggested that transitioning to the OBFR would not require significant changes in the way the Committee conducted and communicated monetary policy.",2018-11-08,DOVISH,0.9814898371696472

"The expansion of domestic final demand increasingly would be held back by the anticipated waning of positive wealth effects associated with large earlier gains in equity prices, the slower growth of spending on consumer durables, houses, and business equipment and software in the wake of the prolonged buildup in the stocks of these items, and the higher intermediate- and longer-term interest rates that had evolved as markets came to expect that a rise in short-term interest rates would be needed to achieve sustainable, noninflationary growth.",1999-12-21,HAWKISH,0.9921485185623169

"The economy clearly would carry substantial expansionary momentum into the new year, quite possibly in excess of growth in the economy's long-run potential, and the key issue for the Committee was whether growth in aggregate demand would slow to a more sustainable pace without further tightening in the stance of monetary policy.",1999-12-21,HAWKISH,0.9913402199745178
"Looking beyond the near term, members continued to anticipate some moderation in the growth of domestic demand, though the extent of the moderation remained subject to a wide range of uncertainty related in part to the difficulty of anticipating trends in stock market prices and their effects on business and consumer sentiment and spending.",1999-12-21,DOVISH,0.9292288422584534
"Members also noted that prospective slowing in domestic demand was likely to be offset, at least to some extent, by further growth in exports should foreign economies as a group continue to strengthen as many forecasters anticipated.",1999-12-21,DOVISH,0.5554571747779846
Uncertainties about the level and growth of potential output and the dynamics of the inflation process made it difficult to relate with confidence projections of demand and activity to prospects for inflation.,1999-12-21,DOVISH,0.9768766760826111

"Nonetheless, the increase in aggregate demand had been exceeding even the now-higher sustainable rate of growth in aggregate supply, as indicated by declines in the pool of available but unemployed workers to a very low level and by the rise in imports.",1999-12-21,HAWKISH,0.9848368763923645
This difference between the growth of demand and potential supply could well persist unless demand moderated.,1999-12-21,HAWKISH,0.880891740322113
"Absent a possible moderation, an upturn in unit labor costs was seen as a likely possibility, with eventual adverse implications for price inflation.",1999-12-21,HAWKISH,0.977449893951416
"Inflation pressures might also be augmented over time by a number of special factors such as the rise in energy prices, the effects on import prices of the dollar's depreciation and strengthening foreign economies, and faster increases in medical costs.",1999-12-21,HAWKISH,0.9853915572166443
"While several of these factors implied limited price level adjustments, they could become embedded to a degree in ongoing inflation through their effects on wage increases and inflation expectations.",1999-12-21,HAWKISH,0.8140444755554199

Rising employment and incomes along with the advance in stock market prices to new highs in recent weeks were fostering elevated levels of consumer confidence and would be supporting consumer spending going forward.,1999-12-21,HAWKISH,0.831722617149353
"While recent developments provided little basis for anticipating slower growth in consumer spending, members commented that such spending could be vulnerable to adverse developments in the stock market and the attendant effects on consumer wealth and confidence; and spending for household durables could be damped by the anticipated softness in housing activity.",1999-12-21,NEUTRAL,0.9114658236503601

"The solid further expansion expected in many foreign economies, the slower growth of domestic demand in the United States, and the effects of the slippage of the foreign exchange value of the dollar on the relative prices of U. S. goods and services were all seen as contributing to this outcome.",1999-12-21,DOVISH,0.6323832273483276
"While expanding foreign demand for U. S. goods and services was a welcome development from the perspective of numerous business firms, such demand might add to pressures on U.

"Several members indicated their concern about the burgeoning current account deficit and the potential that it could lead to a considerable weakening of the dollar at some point, which would tend to add to upward pressure on prices and demand.",1999-12-21,HAWKISH,0.9895070195198059
"In their comments regarding the outlook for inflation, a number of members expressed concern that the anticipated moderation in overall demand might not be large enough or soon enough to forestall added pressures on already-taut labor markets.",1999-12-21,HAWKISH,0.980215311050415
"Although wage growth had remained moderate to date and unit labor costs damped, at some point tightening labor markets would begin to generate wage gains increasingly in excess of productivity gains.",1999-12-21,HAWKISH,0.6585513353347778
"In addition, some of the forces that had been restraining inflation--declining oil, import, and commodity prices, and subdued increases in the costs of health care--had already reversed.",1999-12-21,DOVISH,0.6929442882537842
"Even so, resulting acceleration in price inflation might be held down and possibly averted for a time by the economy's buoyant upward trend in productivity, which could support profit margins and help maintain the highly competitive conditions in many markets that made it difficult or impossible for most business firms to raise their prices.",1999-12-21,HAWKISH,0.8582912087440491

"They saw little risk of a significant acceleration in inflation over the near term, given recent price trends and the absence of indications that inflationary expectations might be deteriorating, and thus little cost in deferring consideration of a policy tightening action.",1999-12-21,DOVISH,0.6513624787330627
"While a preemptive tightening move might be warranted in the not-too-distant future to help contain inflationary pressures in the economy, these members believed that a symmetrical directive would best convey the message that no tightening action was contemplated for the weeks immediately ahead.",1999-12-21,HAWKISH,0.9833229184150696

"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic developments, members commented on the stronger-than-expected expansion in overall economic activity in recent months, but for a variety of reasons they anticipated that growth would slow appreciably over the second half of the year to a pace more in line with the growth in the economy's potential.",1996-07-02,HAWKISH,0.5384939312934875
Key factors bearing on this outlook included the prospective effects of the rise in interest rates and the dollar that had occurred since earlier in the year and the waning influence of transitory factors that had stimulated economic activity in the second quarter.,1996-07-02,DOVISH,0.9437516331672668
"The members generally agreed, however, that, apart from evidence of some moderation in the growth of business investment expenditures from a very rapid pace, there were few hard indications of a slowing in the expansion and the risks were clearly to the upside of their current forecasts.",1996-07-02,HAWKISH,0.969801127910614

"However, spending for computing equipment, while perhaps moderating from the exceptional pace of recent quarters, was thought likely to remain buoyant as continuing innovations and declining prices stimulated further solid gains in this segment of business spending.",1996-07-02,DOVISH,0.5576984882354736
Housing was seen as another important sector of the economy that was likely to exert a retarding effect on the expansion as the rise that had occurred in mortgage interest rates was felt increasingly in housing markets.,1996-07-02,HAWKISH,0.9862728714942932
"Members viewed the outlook for inflation as a source of substantial uncertainty in their forecasts, though many saw reasonable prospects that a rate of economic expansion in line with their forecasts and associated levels of capacity utilization would prove to be consistent with little change in the core rate of inflation.",1996-07-02,DOVISH,0.9855743646621704

"Whether greater labor cost pressures would emerge in the context of the members' consensus forecast for economic activity was a critical issue in the outlook for prices, though it was noted that at least some of the rising costs were likely to be absorbed in shrinking profit margins.",1996-07-02,HAWKISH,0.9680744409561157
"Even if greater price inflation were averted under that scenario, the members saw a substantial risk that if economic growth did not slow in line with their current forecasts, the resulting added pressures on resources would at some point translate into higher price inflation.",1996-07-02,HAWKISH,0.9776709079742432

"Some also observed that the precise level of average price inflation that might be compatible with the optimal functioning of the economy was an unsettled issue owing, for example, to potential rigidities in labor markets.",1996-07-02,DOVISH,0.9026191234588623
"Thus far, such rigidities had not impeded the economy from functioning at a very high level as inflation came down, and continued adaptation to even lower inflation rates was very likely.",1996-07-02,HAWKISH,0.9170927405357361

Meeting participants also discussed how best to employ the Federal Reserve's balance sheet to promote monetary policy goals.,2008-12-16,DOVISH,0.8559787273406982
Participants also generally believed that the special liquidity and lending facilities implemented or announced recently would support the availability of credit to businesses and households and thus help sustain economic activity.,2008-12-16,NEUTRAL,0.5758921504020691
"Participants emphasized that the ultimate objective of special lending facilities and asset purchases was to support overall market functioning, financial intermediation, and economic growth.",2008-12-16,NEUTRAL,0.670852780342102
"However, they also recognized that, as economic activity recovered and financial conditions normalized, the use of certain policy tools would need to be scaled back, the size of the balance sheet and level of excess reserves would need to be reduced, and the Committee's policy framework would return to focus on the level of the federal funds rate.",2008-12-16,DOVISH,0.6796624064445496
"A number of participants observed that, under the approach of conducting monetary policy by acquiring a variety of assets as needed to address financial and macroeconomic strains, the quantity of excess reserves and the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet would be determined by the Federal Reserve's asset purchases and the usage of its lending facilities.",2008-12-16,DOVISH,0.9742732644081116
"Several other participants, however, noted that increases in excess reserves or the monetary base, by themselves, might not have a significant stimulative effect on the economy or prices because the normal bank intermediation mechanism appeared to be impaired, and banks may not be willing to lend their excess reserves.",2008-12-16,DOVISH,0.8014389872550964

A few members stressed that the absence of an explicit federal funds rate target would give banks added flexibility in pricing loans and deposits in the current environment of unusually low interest rates.,2008-12-16,NEUTRAL,0.9205712676048279
"However, other members noted that not announcing a target might confuse market participants and lead investors to believe that the Federal Reserve was unable to control the federal funds rate when it could, in fact, still influence the effective federal funds rate through adjustments of the interest rate on excess reserves and the primary credit rate.",2008-12-16,DOVISH,0.9530975222587585

"Some participants expressed the view that the SRF would help ensure interest rate control as the size of the balance sheet approached its longer-run level; several participants noted that the SRF could facilitate a faster runoff of the balance sheet than might otherwise be the case; several participants raised the possibility that the establishment of the SRF could reduce the demand for reserves in the longer run, suggesting that the longer-run balance sheet could be smaller than otherwise.",2022-01-26,HAWKISH,0.4806838035583496
