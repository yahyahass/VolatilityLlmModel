Staff Economic Outlook The projection for U. S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the September FOMC meeting was broadly similar to the July projection.,2021-09-22,DOVISH,0.9567024111747742

"As a result, the 12‑month change in PCE prices was projected to hold roughly steady over the remainder of 2021 and to end the year well above 2 percent.",2021-09-22,DOVISH,0.8842079639434814
"Over the following year, the boost to consumer prices caused by supply issues was expected to partly reverse and import prices were expected to decelerate sharply.",2021-09-22,HAWKISH,0.6996252536773682
"PCE price inflation was therefore expected to step down to a little below 2 percent in 2022; thereafter, additional increases in resource utilization were expected to cause it to gradually edge higher and to reach 2 percent in 2024.",2021-09-22,HAWKISH,0.5455615520477295

Several participants indicated that a rise in the labor force participation rate might lag the improvements in other indicators such as the unemployment rate—a pattern consistent with past business cycle recoveries.,2021-09-22,DOVISH,0.7793967723846436

Some participants expressed concerns that elevated rates of inflation could feed through into longer-term inflation expectations of households and businesses or saw recent inflation data as suggestive of broader inflation pressures.,2021-09-22,HAWKISH,0.974604070186615
"Several other participants pointed out that the largest contributors to the recent elevated measures of inflation were a handful of COVID-related, pandemic-sensitive categories in which specific, identifiable bottlenecks were at play.",2021-09-22,HAWKISH,0.9746978282928467
This observation suggested that the upward pressure on prices would abate as the COVID-related demand and supply imbalances subsided.,2021-09-22,HAWKISH,0.8301186561584473

Participants generally saw the risks to the outlook for economic activity as broadly balanced.,2021-09-22,DOVISH,0.9748538732528687
Most participants saw inflation risks as weighted to the upside because of concerns that supply disruptions and labor shortages might last longer and might have larger or more persistent effects on prices and wages than they currently assumed.,2021-09-22,HAWKISH,0.9803380966186523
"A few participants commented that there were also some downside risks for inflation, as the factors that had held inflation down over the previous long expansion were likely still in place.",2021-09-22,HAWKISH,0.4933602809906006
"In their consideration of the stance of monetary policy, participants reaffirmed the Federal Reserve's commitment to using its full range of tools to support the U.

"These participants stated that, in such circumstances, a major challenge facing policymakers—especially in the presence of the effective lower bound on the federal funds rate—was to maintain a policy stance sufficiently accommodative to keep average inflation at 2 percent and thereby bolster the credibility of the Committee's new policy framework, facilitating the achievement of both maximum employment and price stability.",2021-09-22,NEUTRAL,0.9736936092376709

Part of this projected increase in the rate of real GDP growth reflected the staff's expectation that the drag on economic growth from fiscal policy would be smaller in the second half as the pace of reductions in federal government purchases slowed and as the restraint on growth in consumer spending stemming from the higher taxes put in place at the beginning of the year diminished.,2013-07-31,DOVISH,0.7051284313201904

"Such spending would be fostered by the monetary ease and fiscal stimulus already in place and abetted by vigorous anticipated growth in structural productivity, which would support household incomes and business investment incentives.",2002-05-07,NEUTRAL,0.875167727470398
"With a relatively robust contour for the course of final sales over the forecast horizon, the pressure on resources would rise somewhat despite the anticipated higher growth of structural productivity.",2002-05-07,HAWKISH,0.9833610653877258
"Nonetheless, activity would remain below the economy's potential for a period ahead and the persistence of underutilized resources was expected to contribute to damped core consumer price inflation.",2002-05-07,NEUTRAL,0.991962730884552

"The currently stimulative stance of both fiscal and monetary policy would tend to undergird final demand, especially in the context of an economy that had exhibited a marked degree of resilience and strength in underlying productivity growth that would bolster household incomes and provide incentives for business capital spending.",2002-05-07,NEUTRAL,0.8980624079704285
"Members noted, however, that an already high level of consumer spending pointed to more limited than usual scope for further growth in such spending, and gloomy business sentiment in the face of disappointing sales and profits raised a question about the extent to which business investment would help to lift final demand over coming quarters.",2002-05-07,NEUTRAL,0.5490992665290833
"Given growth in economic activity broadly in line with current expectations, inflation was likely to remain benign for some time in the context of an apparently strong uptrend in structural labor productivity, excess capacity in many labor and product markets, and a related absence of pricing power in generally very competitive markets.",2002-05-07,NEUTRAL,0.9787806272506714

"On the other hand, employment growth had been very sluggish to date, with employers remaining quite cautious in their hiring practices, and continued softness in labor markets could damp consumer confidence.",2002-05-07,NEUTRAL,0.9796439409255981

The markedly reduced pace of inventory liquidation in the first quarter of the year accounted for much of the step-up in GDP growth in that quarter and provided a strong indication that the period of inventory liquidation under way for more than a year probably was coming to an end.,2002-05-07,HAWKISH,0.792576253414154
"A shift to inventory stocking in the near term, possibly in the current quarter, was seen as a reasonable expectation, but with numerous firms having already moved production into closer alignment with sales, members anticipated much less impetus to overall economic activity from inventories over coming quarters.",2002-05-07,DOVISH,0.9659794569015503
"Although foreign economic activity appeared to be picking up to some extent and the dollar had edged lower, net exports were expected to remain a negative factor in the growth of the domestic economy.",2002-05-07,NEUTRAL,0.6053953766822815

The outlook for inflation remained favorable.,2002-05-07,DOVISH,0.9167544841766357
"Nearly all measures of total and core prices had decelerated over the past year, and in the context of forecasts implying a continued sizable gap between actual and potential output, the risk that inflationary pressures would intensify significantly over coming quarters appeared to be quite limited; indeed, inflation might edge a bit lower in the early stages of the expansion.",2002-05-07,NEUTRAL,0.8655708432197571
"The deceleration in labor costs over the past several quarters, evidence of a surprisingly strong uptrend in structural labor productivity, low and stable inflation expectations, and the widespread absence of pricing power in highly competitive markets were signs that upside inflation risks in the period ahead were relatively small.",2002-05-07,NEUTRAL,0.710087776184082
"These included significant increases in energy costs in recent months, evidence of an upturn in some industrial prices, sharp increases in many insurance costs, continuing upward pressures on medical costs, and modest recent declines in the foreign exchange value of the dollar.",2002-05-07,HAWKISH,0.9827818274497986
"With the stance of monetary policy currently quite accommodative, the members saw the need for careful monitoring of the potential for rising inflation pressures as the economic recovery gained momentum.",2002-05-07,NEUTRAL,0.7435315847396851
The members recognized that monetary policy exerted its effects with a considerable lag and that the current stance of policy probably was inconsistent with the Committee's inflation objective over time.,2002-05-07,DOVISH,0.9334765076637268
"However, current inflation pressures were subdued and were expected to remain so for a considerable period, thereby providing adequate opportunity to evaluate ongoing developments and tighten policy as needed later.",2002-05-07,NEUTRAL,0.6304891705513
"Against the longer-term inflation risks inherent in the current stance of policy, the members weighed the possibility that the expansion could be relatively subdued for a time, damping prices further and failing to reduce margins of underutilized resources.",2002-05-07,NEUTRAL,0.8368040919303894
"In any event, a neutral statement regarding the risks to the economy in the foreseeable future would not preclude a preemptive tightening adjustment in the stance of policy stance should new evidence bearing on the strength of the expansion and the outlook for inflation warrant such a policy move.",2002-05-07,HAWKISH,0.9441485404968262

"In the Committee's discussion of the outlook for wages and prices, members commented that the rate of inflation in consumer prices was difficult to characterize with precision because alterna- tive price indexes provided different measurement results; in particular, chain price indexes for consumption expenditures showed substantially less inflation than the CPI.",1998-08-18,DOVISH,0.9839715957641602
"Even so, it was clear on the basis of any measure that consumer prices and inflation more generally had remained remarkably subdued in the context of very tight labor markets and upward pressure on labor compensation.",1998-08-18,NEUTRAL,0.9790130853652954

"Significant additional tightening in labor markets would, of course, exacerbate that risk, but even at current levels these markets were tight and at some point labor costs could increase more rapidly, pressing on prices.",1998-08-18,HAWKISH,0.986294686794281
"Moreover, the effects of some of the factors holding down inflation seemed likely to wane, and possibly to reverse, over time.",1998-08-18,DOVISH,0.6983210444450378
"The latter included the effects of the dollar's appreciation on the prices of imports and competing domestic products, a possible upturn in energy prices and perhaps other commodity prices as foreign economies stabilized, and faster increases in the costs of worker benefits, notably those related to health care.",1998-08-18,HAWKISH,0.9832165837287903

"In this regard it was noted that while domestic financial conditions remained generally accommodative, recent developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets had tended on balance to decrease some of the stimulative effects of financial conditions on aggregate demand in the United States by shifting demand overseas, increasing somewhat the cost of raising capital, and reducing the financial wealth of households.",1998-08-18,HAWKISH,0.5919169187545776

"The staff expected the 12-month change in PCE prices to gradually move down in coming months, reflecting, importantly, the fading of base effects along with smaller expected monthly price increases, but PCE price inflation was forecast to still be well above 2 percent at the end of this year.",2021-06-16,DOVISH,0.5830706357955933
"Over the next year, the transitory price increases caused by bottlenecks and supply constraints were expected to largely reverse, and the growth in demand was forecast to ease.",2021-06-16,HAWKISH,0.6529028415679932
"As a result, inflation was projected to slow to slightly below 2 percent in 2022 before moving back up to a bit above 2 percent in 2023, supported by high levels of resource utilization.",2021-06-16,NEUTRAL,0.5734699964523315
"Nevertheless, the staff judged that the risks around their strong baseline projection for economic activity were still tilted somewhat to the downside, as adverse alternative courses of the pandemic—including the possibility of the spread of more-contagious, more-vaccine-resistant COVID-19 variants—seemed more likely than outcomes that would be more favorable than in the baseline forecast.",2021-06-16,NEUTRAL,0.8244785070419312
The staff continued to view the risks around the inflation projection as roughly balanced.,2021-06-16,DOVISH,0.9621354937553406
"On the upside, bottlenecks, supply disruptions, and historically high rates of resource utilization were seen as potential sources of greater-than-expected inflationary pressures, particularly if there were a significant rise in inflation expectations that altered inflation dynamics.",2021-06-16,HAWKISH,0.9863116145133972
"On the downside, if the effects of supply constraints proved to be transitory, as expected, then the inflation record from the past 25 years suggested the possibility that low underlying trend inflation and a flat Phillips curve could cause inflation to revert to relatively low levels despite a strengthening economy.",2021-06-16,NEUTRAL,0.8197754621505737
"Participants' Views on Current Economic Conditions and the Economic Outlook In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2021 through 2023 and over the longer run, based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including the path of the federal funds rate.",2021-06-16,DOVISH,0.9810061454772949

Participants' projections of real GDP growth in 2022 and 2023 were generally little changed.,2021-06-16,DOVISH,0.9349597096443176

"A number of participants noted that business equipment investment was rising at a strong pace, but growth in manufacturing activity was being restrained by production bottlenecks and supply constraints.",2021-06-16,HAWKISH,0.6268805861473083
"In addition, participants reported hearing from contacts in a broad range of industries that shortages of materials and labor as well as supply chain challenges were limiting the ability of firms to keep up with demand.",2021-06-16,HAWKISH,0.9415667057037354
"Some business contacts indicated that they were responding to input shortages and bottlenecks by canceling shifts, raising compensation to attract and retain workers, raising prices, or focusing on cutting costs and increasing productivity, particularly through automation.",2021-06-16,HAWKISH,0.7619590759277344

"Participants expected labor market conditions to continue to improve, with labor shortages expected to ease throughout the summer and into the fall as progress on vaccinations continues, social distancing unwinds further, more schools reopen, and expanded unemployment insurance benefits expire.",2021-06-16,DOVISH,0.97219318151474
"In their discussions on inflation, participants stated that they had expected inflation to move above 2 percent in the near term, in part as the drop in prices from early in the pandemic fell out of the calculation and past increases in oil prices passed through to consumer energy prices.",2021-06-16,HAWKISH,0.920314610004425
"However, participants remarked that the actual rise in inflation was larger than anticipated, with the 12-month change in the PCE price index reaching 3.",2021-06-16,HAWKISH,0.9768648147583008
Participants attributed the upside surprise to more widespread supply constraints in product and labor markets than they had anticipated and to a larger-than-expected surge in consumer demand as the economy reopened.,2021-06-16,HAWKISH,0.6717599630355835
They noted that many of their District contacts had reported that higher input costs were putting upward pressure on prices.,2021-06-16,HAWKISH,0.9702287912368774
Most participants observed that the largest contributors to the rise in measured inflation were sectors affected by supply bottlenecks or sectors where price levels were rebounding from levels depressed by the pandemic.,2021-06-16,HAWKISH,0.9523568749427795
"Looking ahead, participants generally expected inflation to ease as the effect of these transitory factors dissipated, but several participants remarked that they anticipated that supply chain limitations and input shortages would put upward pressure on prices into next year.",2021-06-16,HAWKISH,0.9663658142089844

"Although they generally saw the risks to the outlook for economic activity as broadly balanced, a substantial majority of participants judged that the risks to their inflation projections were tilted to the upside because of concerns that supply disruptions and labor shortages might linger for longer and might have larger or more persistent effects on prices and wages than they currently assumed.",2021-06-16,HAWKISH,0.9769518971443176
Several participants expressed concern that longer-term inflation expectations might rise to inappropriate levels if elevated inflation readings persisted.,2021-06-16,HAWKISH,0.9635138511657715
Several other participants cautioned that downside risks to inflation remained because temporary price pressures might unwind faster than currently anticipated and because the forces that held down inflation and inflation expectations during the previous economic expansion had not gone away or might reinforce the effect of the unwinding of temporary price pressures.,2021-06-16,HAWKISH,0.9208793044090271
