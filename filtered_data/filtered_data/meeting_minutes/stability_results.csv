"A possible rise in inflation remained the main threat to sustained economic expansion, but it was not anticipated that further tightening would be needed in the near term and there would be time to gather substantially more information about the balance of risks relating to trends in aggregate demand and supply.",1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9327592253684998
"Most other short-term market interest rates posted small mixed changes on balance, because the policy action was widely anticipated and the FOMC's policy announcement after the August 24 meeting referenced markedly diminished inflation risks.",1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.4596959054470062

"Most measures of share prices in equity markets registered sizable declines over the intermeeting period, apparently reflecting not only higher interest rates but also concerns that U.

Expansion of these two monetary aggregates was supported by further rapid expansion in the demand for currency and stronger inflows to retail money market funds at a time of weakness in U. S. bond and equity markets.,1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.6281824111938477
"In addition, growth of M3 was sustained by large flows into institution-only money market funds as the yields on those funds caught up to earlier increases in short-term market rates.",1999-10-05,STABLE,0.5573620200157166
The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion would gradually moderate to a rate around or perhaps a little below the growth of the economy's estimated potential.,1999-10-05,STABLE,0.5738773941993713
"The growth of domestic final demand increasingly would be held back by the anticipated waning of positive wealth effects associated with earlier large gains in equity prices; the slower growth of spending on consumer durables, houses, and business equipment in the wake of the prolonged buildup in the stocks of these items; and the higher intermediate- and longer-term interest rates that had evolved as markets came to expect that a rise in short-term interest rates would be needed to achieve a better balance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply.",1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9963325262069702
"Core price inflation was projected to rise somewhat over the forecast horizon, in part as a result of higher non-oil import prices and some firming of gains in nominal labor compensation in persistently tight labor markets that would not be fully offset by rising productivity growth.",1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9914507269859314
"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members commented that the incoming information suggested that the expansion had been considerably stronger in recent months than many had anticipated, while most measures of inflation had remained subdued.",1999-10-05,STABLE,0.6221213340759277
"This outlook was supported by the emergence of somewhat less accommodative conditions in financial markets, including the increases that had occurred in interest rates over the past several months and the steadying of stock market prices over the same period.",1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9724359512329102
"On the other hand, foreign economies were strengthening more quickly than anticipated and rising exports were likely to offset part of the slowdown in domestic demand.",1999-10-05,STABLE,0.6058907508850098
The implications of continued robust growth for the inflation outlook depended critically on judgments about the supply side of the economy.,1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.7274622321128845
That acceleration had itself tended to boost consumption and investment demand--in complex interactions of aggregate supply and demand--but it also had held down increases in unit costs and prices.,1999-10-05,STABLE,0.6854170560836792
"A great deal of uncertainty surrounded the behavior of productivity growth going forward, but some further pickup, and the associated ability of the economy to accommodate more rapid growth without added inflation, was a possibility that could not be overlooked.",1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9925963878631592
"However, a further pickup in productivity growth was by no means assured, and a number of other favorable developments in supply and prices that had acted to restrain inflation in recent years had already begun to dissipate or reverse.",1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9941039681434631
"These included the substantial upturn in energy prices, the ebbing of import price declines, and the pickup in health care costs; adverse trends in the latter two factors in particular were likely to be extended.",1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9914326667785645
"In these circumstances, members generally saw some risk of rising inflation going forward, but they also recognized that similar forecasts in recent years had proved wrong and that considerable uncertainty surrounded expectations of somewhat higher core inflation.",1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9922835230827332
"In their review of developments across the nation, members reported continued high levels of activity in all regions and few indications of moderating growth, though agriculture remained relatively depressed in many areas.",1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.7760136127471924
The anecdotal information from around the nation clearly supported the overall statistical evidence of persisting strength in key components of domestic demand.,1999-10-05,STABLE,0.8109821677207947
"Some of the strength in consumer durables was related to purchases associated with homebuilding, which, though likely to slacken a little owing to the rise in mortgage interest rates, seemed to be staying at a high level.",1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.8678940534591675
"While consumer spending probably would be sustained by further anticipated growth in employment and incomes, the pause in the stock market, should it persist, and the attendant effects on financial wealth were expected with some lag to damp further gains in consumer expenditures.",1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9952793121337891
"Further noteworthy gains were recorded in business expenditures for computing and communications equipment, evidently reflecting ongoing efforts to take advantage of declining prices and improving technology.",1999-10-05,STABLE,0.5676774978637695
"Over time, however, ongoing efforts to enhance productivity for competitive reasons suggested further vigorous growth in spending for such equipment.",1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.5031558275222778
It seemed likely that commercial building activity would be damped later as new capacity was completed and financing became less attractive in response to the rise that had occurred in market interest rates.,1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.994126558303833
"Such stockbuilding might well intensify during the closing months of the year and be reversed early next year, with effects of uncertain magnitude on overall economic activity in that period.",1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.986230194568634
"The strengthening of many economies around the world was seen as a harbinger of increasing demand for U. S. exports, a view that was reinforced by growing anecdotal indications of improving foreign markets for a wide range of U. S. products.",1999-10-05,STABLE,0.7738521099090576
An aspect of that improvement was more attractive investment opportunities abroad and some associated weakening in the foreign exchange value of the dollar that implied upward pressure on the prices of imports and to an uncertain extent on those of competing domestically produced products.,1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.992426872253418
"Moreover, some members saw the possibility of a steeper drop in the dollar--under pressure from burgeoning foreign dollar portfolios as a consequence of very large U. S. current account deficits--as an added source of risk to the maintenance of sustainable growth and low inflation in the United States.",1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9952154159545898
"In the Committee's discussion of the outlook for inflation, a number of members emphasized that the behavior of prices had remained surprisingly benign for an extended period, confounding earlier forecasts of appreciable acceleration stemming from tight labor markets and rising labor costs.",1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.5194046497344971
That experience argued forcefully in their view for the need to regard forecasts of increasing inflation with considerable caution.,1999-10-05,STABLE,0.5564442276954651
Most members nonetheless continued to view some increase in core price inflation as a definite possibility.,1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9844236969947815
"This view reflected their expectations that the current expansion, even if it did moderate to a pace approximating the economy's trend potential growth, would do so at a level of resource use that based on the historical record exceeded the economy's sustainable capacity--perhaps by even more than at present, given the evident strength of aggregate demand.",1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.990231454372406
"Such an outcome seemed likely to generate further pressures on unit labor costs, which had tended in recent years to be contained by accelerating productivity.",1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9786150455474854
"There was no evidence that the acceleration was coming to an end, but the members saw a clear risk that upward pressures on labor costs could at some point outpace gains in productivity.",1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9903834462165833
Other factors cited as pointing to a less benign inflation performance involved the waning or reversal of a number of temporary influences that had exerted a beneficial effect on prices in recent years.,1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.96090167760849
"In particular, the decline of the dollar from its recent high in July, especially if it were to continue, would mean higher import prices and reduced price competition for a wide range of domestic goods.",1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9886288642883301
"In this regard, several members observed that they were hearing noticeably fewer comments by business contacts about their inability to raise prices.",1999-10-05,STABLE,0.6966387033462524
"Members also noted that, in the context of apparently strengthening economic activity worldwide, non-oil commodity prices seemed poised to turn upward, though they had risen only slightly thus far.",1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.6071052551269531
"While oil prices, which had increased sharply this year, had changed relatively little recently and could move down in the future, secondary effects of the earlier increase on costs and prices in other sectors of the economy seemed likely.",1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9542171359062195
"Nonetheless, considerable uncertainty surrounded expectations of rising inflation.",1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.968316376209259
Labor cost increases had not turned up and core inflation continued to edge lower.,1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.6506280899047852
Further improvements in productivity growth could keep price pressures in check for some time.,1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.7890024185180664
"Members commented that they saw little risk of a surge in inflation over coming months, though some pickup from the currently subdued level of core price inflation was a distinct possibility under prospective economic conditions.",1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9728562831878662
"It was noted that expanding aggregate supply, boosted by accelerating productivity, had remained in reasonable balance with rapidly growing aggregate demand despite an already high level of economic activity; however, substantial uncertainty surrounded the outlook for aggregate supply and aggregate demand going forward and it was unclear how their interaction would affect the behavior of inflation.",1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.995152473449707
"In light of the uncertainties surrounding these developments, the members agreed that it would be desirable to await more evidence on the performance of the economy, and in this regard considerable new information on the behavior of the economy and the outlook for inflation would become available during the intermeeting period.",1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9942010045051575
"The risks of waiting seemed small at this juncture, in part because inflation and inflation expectations were not likely to worsen substantially in the near term, and the Committee had demonstrated its willingness to take needed anticipatory action to curb rising inflationary pressures that could threaten the overall performance of the economy.",1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.6088289022445679
"They also believed that, given the Committee's recently adopted practice of immediately announcing its decisions to change the symmetry of the directive, an asymmetrical directive would help convey the message that policy adjustments might not yet be completed for the balance of this year and that the Committee remained concerned about potential inflationary developments in coming months.",1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.996931791305542
"Other members, while generally agreeing that the risks pointed on balance to some rise in inflation over time, nonetheless were quite uncertain about the timing of any additional firming in monetary policy and preferred to leave the Committee's possible future course of action more open.",1999-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9921560287475586
"At the conclusion of this discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until it was instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive: The information reviewed at this meeting suggests that the expansion of economic activity was substantial in the quarter just ended.",1999-10-05,STABLE,0.7930533289909363
