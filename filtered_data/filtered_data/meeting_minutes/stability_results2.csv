Consumer spending was projected to expand at a more moderate pace that would be in line with the projected increase in disposable income; the favorable effect of the earlier run-up in equity prices on household wealth and the generally ample availability of credit were expected to balance continuing consumer concerns about the adequacy of their savings and the restraining effect of high household debt burdens.,1996-08-20,NO-EFFECT,0.4268984794616699

"Although increases in compensation might be moderated by greater productivity or absorbed for a time by lower profit margins, the risks seemed tilted toward increases in inflation at some point, especially if the growth of the economy continued to outstrip its potential and added to pressures on resources.",1996-08-20,NO-EFFECT,0.9962473511695862
"In the course of the Committee's discussion, members cited a variety of indications that economic growth was slowing from a very rapid pace, and they pointed to a number of factors that in their view should promote continued, though more moderate, expansion in economic activity.",1996-08-20,NO-EFFECT,0.9200292825698853
"It was noted that much of the stimulus for the strong expansion in the first half of the year had been provided by large increases in spending for consumer durables, housing, and business equipment; however, growth in such spending could be expected to slow in the context of increasingly satisfied pent-up demands and the lagged effects of earlier increases in intermediate- and long-term interest rates on these interest-sensitive sectors of the economy.",1996-08-20,NO-EFFECT,0.9939212799072266
"Should the expansion in final demand fail to moderate to a sustainable pace, business firms would be likely to intensify their efforts to build their inventories, which currently were widely viewed as satisfactory or even relatively lean in relation to sales.",1996-08-20,NO-EFFECT,0.9933329224586487
"Accordingly, aggressive inventory accumulation remained an upside risk to the projected expansion but not one that was likely to materialize unless final demand were to exceed current forecasts by a significant margin.",1996-08-20,NO-EFFECT,0.8718092441558838
"In their discussion of the outlook for inflation, members observed that increases in prices had remained remarkably subdued for an extended period in relation to measures of resource utilization, notably the rate of unemployment.",1996-08-20,STABLE,0.6593722105026245
One factor tending to hold down prices has been highly competitive markets--throughout the nation and internationally as well--that made it very difficult for business firms to raise prices.,1996-08-20,NO-EFFECT,0.8673031330108643
"Another key factor, though one whose importance might now be starting to diminish, was the persistence of comparatively small increases in labor compensation, which remained appreciably below earlier norms in relation to levels of unemployment.",1996-08-20,NO-EFFECT,0.8443151712417603
"In assessing whether a relatively favorable inflation performance was likely to continue, the members focused on a variety of issues.",1996-08-20,STABLE,0.7223341464996338
Another was whether a rate of unemployment in the vicinity of its current level would foster added wage pressures.,1996-08-20,STABLE,0.7949482798576355
"Uncertainty also surrounded the extent to which further increases in labor compensation costs, should they materialize, would be passed through to higher prices.",1996-08-20,NO-EFFECT,0.9771461486816406
"Improvements in productivity were likely to offset part of such increases, but how much remained an open question.",1996-08-20,NO-EFFECT,0.8438416719436646
"With regard to the outlook for wages, members observed that, though it was too early to reach a firm judgment, the acceleration of wage increases this year might well augur faster advances that were more in line with historical experience under essentially full employment conditions.",1996-08-20,NO-EFFECT,0.8978962898254395
"On balance, the inflation risks in the outlook clearly seemed to be to the upside, with the potential for more inflation stemming from rising labor compensation costs augmented by a rise in the minimum wage and the prospect of higher food prices and perhaps energy prices over the next several quarters.",1996-08-20,NO-EFFECT,0.9956230521202087
"In the Committee's discussion of policy for the intermeeting period ahead, members focused on indications that the economy already was slowing, perhaps by enough to limit pressures on resources, and they noted that broad statistical measures of prices and the anecdotal evidence did not suggest that a pickup in inflation was already under way.",1996-08-20,NO-EFFECT,0.9852465391159058
"A number also commented that real interest rates were not unusually low, suggesting that any pickup in inflationary pressures, should that occur, would be modest and readily contained.",1996-08-20,STABLE,0.5225807428359985
Such a development could have serious adverse consequences for economic activity if the expansion was in fact already slowing to a more sustainable and less inflationary pace.,1996-08-20,NO-EFFECT,0.9752944707870483
"At the same time, it was emphasized that the Committee remained committed to a policy that would resist a rise in inflation; such a policy would entail moving in anticipation of greater price pressures and before they showed through to actual inflation.",1996-08-20,NO-EFFECT,0.9304037094116211
Such a directive would imply that any tightening should be implemented promptly if developments were perceived as pointing to rising inflation.,1996-08-20,NO-EFFECT,0.9249502420425415
"For now, the Committee should remain particularly vigilant to incoming information bearing on the outlook for inflation.",1996-08-20,NO-EFFECT,0.9864625334739685
A differing view gave more weight to the risks of rising inflation.,1996-08-20,STABLE,0.6105576753616333
"In this view, while there were uncertainties, the weight of the evidence suggested that a prompt policy action was needed to contain inflation and set the stage for further progress toward price stability.",1996-08-20,NO-EFFECT,0.9849854707717896
"More importantly, a prompt action would reduce the risk that inflation would worsen and pose difficult problems for monetary policy later.",1996-08-20,NO-EFFECT,0.8741868734359741
"Accordingly, in the context of the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided that somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period.",1996-08-20,NO-EFFECT,0.9783047437667847

"Looking ahead, slower growth in economic activity would tend to hold down pressures on wages and prices during 1999 and imports from Asian and other depressed economies would continue to generate intense competition in many markets; but labor markets remained tight, energy and commodity prices could well turn up after substantial declines, and the recent depreciation of the dollar would lessen pressures from foreign competition.",1998-11-17,NO-EFFECT,0.9943208694458008
