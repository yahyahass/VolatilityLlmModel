Another key factor in the outlook for inflation was the course of oil and other energy prices.,2000-11-15,TRUST,0.9997934699058533
"Thus far, increases in energy costs had been reflected only marginally in core consumer prices, and while there were widespread market expectations of declining oil prices in coming quarters, a great deal of uncertainty, including the potential for more difficulties in the Middle East, surrounded the timing and extent of such an outcome.",2000-11-15,TRUST,0.9997687935829163
"The longer relatively high energy prices persisted, of course, the greater might be their imprint on both inflation expectations and core prices.",2000-11-15,TRUST,0.9997649788856506
"In sum, the moderation in economic expansion, the persistence of highly competitive conditions in most domestic markets, the outlook for continued robust gains in productivity, and relatively subdued inflation expectations were favorable factors in the inflation outlook, but the members continued to view the prospects as weighted on balance in the direction of a gradual uptrend in core inflation.",2000-11-15,TRUST,0.9998434782028198

"Indeed, a few members commented that measures of core inflation already were near or slightly above levels that they viewed as acceptable for the longer run.",2000-11-15,TRUST,0.9997853636741638
"Although overall financial conditions had tightened over the course of recent months and currently appeared to be holding down the growth in spending, this added restraint was likely to be necessary to contain inflation pressures.",2000-11-15,TRUST,0.9997633099555969
"In these circumstances, all the members saw the maintenance of a steady policy as the best course at this juncture to promote the Committee's longer-run objectives of price stability and sustainable economic expansion.",2000-11-15,TRUST,0.9997699856758118

"And while the members could see an increased risk of a marked slowing of growth relative to the rapid rate of expansion of the economy's potential, the degree to which growth in demand might remain sufficiently damped to contain and offset those inflation pressures was quite uncertain.",2000-11-15,TRUST,0.9997658133506775
"Moreover, a shift in the Committee's published views might induce an undesirable softening in overall financial market conditions, which in itself would tend to add to inflation pressures.",2000-11-15,TRUST,0.9996612071990967
"The members concluded that retaining a risk statement weighted toward more inflation pressures would best represent their current thinking, but they believed it was desirable to provide some recognition of the emergence of increased downside risks to the economic expansion in the statement to be released after this meeting.",2000-11-15,TRUST,0.9998059868812561

Meeting participants noted that weakness in the housing market had not spilled over to aggregate consumption--though the flattening out in house prices likely would contribute to an increase in the personal saving rate--and turmoil in the subprime mortgage market did not appear to be generating any diminution in the availability of other types of household credit.,2007-03-21,TRUST,0.9998288154602051
The recent increase in oil prices and the reduction in household net worth resulting from the small net declines in equity prices during the intermeeting period warranted a modest downward adjustment in projected growth of consumer spending.,2007-03-21,TRUST,0.9997647404670715

"The rise in outlays for computers and related products was likely to remain fairly robust in light of the continuing advances in technology and the marked downtrend in computer prices, but the growth of computer expenditures was projected to be well below the extraordinary pace of the past few years.",1996-03-26,TRUST,0.9998095631599426
The slowdown would reflect factors that were expected to damp the growth of overall business investment spending and a greater saturation of potential computer markets that might lead to more emphasis on replacement demand rather than the further expansion of capacity.,1996-03-26,TRUST,0.9997976422309875

Increases in labor costs had been unusually subdued in light of the relatively low unemployment nationwide and widespread anecdotal reports of labor shortages.,1996-03-26,TRUST,0.9997692704200745
"In this view the rise in labor costs could well accelerate at some point, though not necessarily in the near term, with some feedthrough to prices.",1996-03-26,TRUST,0.9997652173042297
"Other developments that generated some concern about the outlook for inflation included the rise in the costs of medical benefits in the fourth quarter, price pressures in the energy and food sectors of the economy, and the possibility that the recent rise in intermediate- and long-term interest rates might to some extent reflect worsening inflationary expectations.",1996-03-26,TRUST,0.9997528195381165

"Even if resource utilization rates were unchanged, slower growth of the labor force would mean that increases in employment would be significantly lower, on average, than those registered in recent years.",2006-09-20,TRUST,0.9997289776802063
"In that case, the slower growth of the labor force and employment implied that the expansion of potential GDP could be somewhat lower than it had been earlier this decade.",2006-09-20,TRUST,0.9997648596763611
"Some participants commented, however, that they viewed potential output growth, as well as expansion of actual output, as likely to remain solid over the next several years.",2006-09-20,TRUST,0.9998371601104736

"To be sure, very recent data on inflation suggested some improvement from the situation in the late spring, partly reflecting slower increases in owners' equivalent rent.",2006-09-20,TRUST,0.9997947812080383
"Also, the considerably lower level of energy prices of recent weeks, if sustained, would help reduce overall inflation and damp increases in core prices.",2006-09-20,TRUST,0.9997648596763611
"However, energy prices remained quite sensitive to a wide range of forces, including geopolitical developments, and might well rebound.",2006-09-20,TRUST,0.9997785687446594
"To date, the available evidence indicated that inflation expectations remained contained--indeed, expectations of price increases for the next few years had fallen some as energy prices declined.",2006-09-20,TRUST,0.9998099207878113
"Nonetheless, several participants worried that inflation expectations could rise and the Federal Reserve's willingness to carry through on its intention to seek price stability could be called into question if cost and price pressures mounted or even if there was no moderation in core inflation.",2006-09-20,NEUTRAL,0.998988687992096
"Looking forward, most participants thought that the most likely outcome was a reduction in inflation pressures, but the anticipated decline was only gradual and the uncertainties around that forecast were skewed toward higher rather than lower inflation rates.",2006-09-20,TRUST,0.9997537732124329

"Although the uncertainties were substantial, core inflation seemed most likely to ebb gradually from its elevated level, in part owing to the waning effects of past increases in energy prices.",2006-09-20,TRUST,0.9998154044151306
The anticipated expansion of economic activity at a pace slightly below the rate of growth of the economy's potential would likely also play a role by easing pressures on resources.,2006-09-20,TRUST,0.9997841715812683
"Members noted that certain developments of late--appreciable declines in energy prices, some softer indicators of economic activity, and slightly lower readings on core inflation--pointed to a modestly better inflation outlook and hence made the policy decision today somewhat less difficult than it was in August, when it was seen as a particularly close call.",2006-09-20,TRUST,0.9998183846473694
"In view of the most recent information on the economy, members agreed that it was appropriate for the post-meeting statement to characterize economic growth as apparently continuing to moderate.",2006-09-20,TRUST,0.9997993111610413
"However, in view of still-high energy and other commodity prices and elevated rates of resource utilization as well as recent indications of a possible acceleration in labor costs, members continued to see a substantial risk that inflation would not decline as anticipated by the Committee.",2006-09-20,TRUST,0.9991852641105652
"Consequently, the Committee agreed that the statement should again cite such risks to inflation and explicitly reference the possibility of additional policy firming.",2006-09-20,TRUST,0.9997209906578064

A couple of participants said they would have expected inflation to slow noticeably if there were substantial and persistent slack.,2012-06-20,TRUST,0.9997747540473938

These participants cited a range of evidence to support their judgment: the still-high fraction of workers who report working part-time jobs because they cannot find full-time work; research showing that job-finding rates among the long-term unemployed were somewhat higher in the recent past than a year earlier; anecdotal evidence to the effect that employers do not see long spells of unemployment as making applicants less attractive for most jobs; and reports that employers were receiving large numbers of applications for each opening and were being especially discriminating when filling vacant positions.,2012-06-20,TRUST,0.9998379945755005
"Another participant pointed to research showing that, in many countries, inflation is less responsive to downward pressure from labor market slack when inflation is already low than when inflation is elevated, and to evidence that firms in the United States have been reluctant to cut nominal wages in recent years, as indications that sizable slack might not cause inflation to decline from its already low level.",2012-06-20,TRUST,0.9997708201408386
These arguments imply that slack in labor markets remains considerable and therefore that a reduction in the unemployment rate toward its longer-run normal level would not have much effect on inflation.,2012-06-20,TRUST,0.9997058510780334

"The downside risks to the forecast for real GDP growth were thought to have diminished, but the risks were still seen as tilted a little to the downside because, with the target federal funds rate at its effective lower bound, the economy was not well positioned to withstand future adverse shocks.",2014-01-29,TRUST,0.9992135763168335

"That expansion was expected to be supported by highly accommodative monetary policy, a further easing of fiscal restraint, and a modest additional pickup in global economic growth, as well as continued improvement in credit conditions and the ongoing strengthening in household balance sheets.",2014-01-29,TRUST,0.9998086094856262

"Moreover, various factors were seen as likely to support stronger growth in the sector going forward, including favorable housing affordability, which was in turn partly due to still-low mortgage rates, and demographic trends.",2014-01-29,TRUST,0.9998099207878113

"In addition, several others pointed out that broader concepts of the unemployment rate, such as those that include nonparticipants who report that they want a job and those working part time who want full-time work, remained well above the official unemployment rate, suggesting that considerable labor market slack remained despite the reduction in the unemployment rate.",2014-01-29,TRUST,0.999784529209137

"However, several factors that cast doubt on this outcome were also mentioned, including slow growth in labor costs, the lack of pricing power reported by business contacts in various parts of the country, the low level of inflation in other advanced economies, and the danger that inflation expectations at short and medium horizons might not be as well anchored as longer-run inflation expectations.",2014-01-29,TRUST,0.998659610748291

"A couple of participants observed that continued low readings on inflation and considerable slack in the labor market raised questions about the desirability of reducing the pace of purchases; these participants judged, however, that a pause in the reduction of purchases was not justified at this stage, especially in light of the strength of the economy in the second half of 2013.",2014-01-29,TRUST,0.9997922778129578

"While making a further measured reduction in its pace of purchases, the Committee emphasized that its holdings of longer-term securities were sizable and would still be increasing, which would promote a stronger economic recovery by maintaining downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, supporting mortgage markets, and helping to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.",2014-01-29,TRUST,0.999776303768158

S. economic activity.",2016-07-27,TRUST,0.9997827410697937
"Overall, U. S. financial conditions eased during the intermeeting period: Major equity indexes rose, longer-term interest rates fell, credit spreads narrowed, and the broad index of the foreign exchange value of the dollar was little changed.",2016-07-27,TRUST,0.9998111128807068
"In the discussion of developments related to financial stability, it was noted that while the capital and liquidity positions of U. S. banks remained strong, European banks, particularly Italian banks, were under pressure--as evidenced by the sharp declines in their equity prices--from a weaker economic outlook for that region, thin interest margins, and concerns about the quality of their loan portfolios.",2016-07-27,TRUST,0.9996374845504761
"However, during the discussion, several participants commented on a few developments, including potential overvaluation in the market for CRE, the elevated level of equity values relative to expected earnings, and the incentives for investors to reach for yield in an environment of continued low interest rates.",2016-07-27,TRUST,0.9998119473457336
"It was also pointed out that investors potentially were becoming more comfortable locking in current yields in an environment in which low interest rates were expected to persist, rather than engaging in the type of speculative behavior that could pose financial stability concerns.",2016-07-27,TRUST,0.9997735619544983

"With inflation still below the Committee's longer-run objective and likely to continue to respond only slowly to somewhat tighter labor markets, most also saw relatively low risk that a further gradual strengthening of the labor market would generate an unwanted increase in inflationary pressures.",2016-07-27,TRUST,0.9998177886009216

Some indicated that a step-down in monthly job gains seemed appropriate as labor market conditions approached those consistent with the Committee's maximum-employment objective and that a more moderate pace of hiring could still be consistent with further increases in labor utilization.,2016-07-27,TRUST,0.9997850060462952

"Several viewed the risks to their inflation forecasts as weighted to the downside, particularly in light of the still-low level of measures of longer-run inflation expectations and inflation compensation and the likelihood that disinflationary pressures from abroad would persist.",2016-07-27,TRUST,0.9997653365135193
"Against the backdrop of their views of the economic outlook, participants discussed the conditions that could warrant taking another step in removing monetary policy accommodation.",2016-07-27,TRUST,0.9997310042381287
"With inflation continuing to run below the Committee's 2 percent objective, many judged that it was appropriate to wait for additional information that would allow them to evaluate the underlying momentum in economic activity and the labor market and whether inflation was continuing to rise gradually to 2 percent as expected.",2016-07-27,TRUST,0.9997870326042175
"Several suggested that the Committee would likely have ample time to react if inflation rose more quickly than they currently anticipated, and they preferred to defer another increase in the federal funds rate until they were more confident that inflation was moving closer to 2 percent on a sustained basis.",2016-07-27,TRUST,0.9997827410697937
"In addition, al­though near-term downside risks to the outlook had diminished over the intermeeting period, some participants stressed that the Committee needed to consider the constraints on the conduct of monetary policy associated with proximity to the effective lower bound on short-term interest rates.",2016-07-27,TRUST,0.9997373223304749
These participants concluded that the Committee should wait to take another step in removing accommodation until the data on economic activity provided a greater level of confidence that economic growth was strong enough to withstand a possible downward shock to demand.,2016-07-27,TRUST,0.9997627139091492
"However, some other participants viewed recent economic developments as indicating that labor market conditions were at or close to those consistent with maximum employment and expected that the recent progress in reaching the Committee's inflation objective would continue, even with further steps to gradually remove monetary policy accommodation.",2016-07-27,TRUST,0.9997603297233582
A few participants pointed out that various benchmarks for assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy supported taking another step in removing policy accommodation.,2016-07-27,TRUST,0.9997721314430237
A few also emphasized the risk to the economic expansion that would be associated with allowing labor market conditions to tighten to an extent that could lead to an unwanted buildup of inflation pressures and thus eventually require a rapid increase in the federal funds rate.,2016-07-27,TRUST,0.9997193217277527

Expansion of these two monetary aggregates was supported by further rapid expansion in the demand for currency and stronger inflows to retail money market funds at a time of weakness in U. S. bond and equity markets.,1999-10-05,TRUST,0.9997989535331726

The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion would gradually moderate to a rate around or perhaps a little below the growth of the economy's estimated potential.,1999-10-05,TRUST,0.9998111128807068
"The growth of domestic final demand increasingly would be held back by the anticipated waning of positive wealth effects associated with earlier large gains in equity prices; the slower growth of spending on consumer durables, houses, and business equipment in the wake of the prolonged buildup in the stocks of these items; and the higher intermediate- and longer-term interest rates that had evolved as markets came to expect that a rise in short-term interest rates would be needed to achieve a better balance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply.",1999-10-05,TRUST,0.9998207688331604
"Core price inflation was projected to rise somewhat over the forecast horizon, in part as a result of higher non-oil import prices and some firming of gains in nominal labor compensation in persistently tight labor markets that would not be fully offset by rising productivity growth.",1999-10-05,TRUST,0.9997531771659851
"In the Committee's discussion of current and prospective economic conditions, members commented that the incoming information suggested that the expansion had been considerably stronger in recent months than many had anticipated, while most measures of inflation had remained subdued.",1999-10-05,TRUST,0.9998131394386292

"On the other hand, foreign economies were strengthening more quickly than anticipated and rising exports were likely to offset part of the slowdown in domestic demand.",1999-10-05,TRUST,0.9997939467430115
The implications of continued robust growth for the inflation outlook depended critically on judgments about the supply side of the economy.,1999-10-05,TRUST,0.9997856020927429
That acceleration had itself tended to boost consumption and investment demand--in complex interactions of aggregate supply and demand--but it also had held down increases in unit costs and prices.,1999-10-05,TRUST,0.9998220801353455
"A great deal of uncertainty surrounded the behavior of productivity growth going forward, but some further pickup, and the associated ability of the economy to accommodate more rapid growth without added inflation, was a possibility that could not be overlooked.",1999-10-05,TRUST,0.9997729659080505
"However, a further pickup in productivity growth was by no means assured, and a number of other favorable developments in supply and prices that had acted to restrain inflation in recent years had already begun to dissipate or reverse.",1999-10-05,TRUST,0.9996806383132935
"These included the substantial upturn in energy prices, the ebbing of import price declines, and the pickup in health care costs; adverse trends in the latter two factors in particular were likely to be extended.",1999-10-05,TRUST,0.9997634291648865
"In these circumstances, members generally saw some risk of rising inflation going forward, but they also recognized that similar forecasts in recent years had proved wrong and that considerable uncertainty surrounded expectations of somewhat higher core inflation.",1999-10-05,TRUST,0.9997813105583191

"While consumer spending probably would be sustained by further anticipated growth in employment and incomes, the pause in the stock market, should it persist, and the attendant effects on financial wealth were expected with some lag to damp further gains in consumer expenditures.",1999-10-05,TRUST,0.9997619986534119

"The strengthening of many economies around the world was seen as a harbinger of increasing demand for U. S. exports, a view that was reinforced by growing anecdotal indications of improving foreign markets for a wide range of U. S. products.",1999-10-05,TRUST,0.9997698664665222
An aspect of that improvement was more attractive investment opportunities abroad and some associated weakening in the foreign exchange value of the dollar that implied upward pressure on the prices of imports and to an uncertain extent on those of competing domestically produced products.,1999-10-05,TRUST,0.9997945427894592
"Moreover, some members saw the possibility of a steeper drop in the dollar--under pressure from burgeoning foreign dollar portfolios as a consequence of very large U.

That experience argued forcefully in their view for the need to regard forecasts of increasing inflation with considerable caution.,1999-10-05,TRUST,0.9997565150260925
