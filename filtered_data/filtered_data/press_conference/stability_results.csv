"We believe that economic conditions will evolve in a way that will warrant gradual, further increases in our federal funds rate target, but if conditions evolve differently than that, whichever direction that might be—it might be that growth is more rapid, the labor market tightens more quickly than we assume, and inflation appears to be picking up more rapidly than we had expected—we have not promised, no matter what, that the path of interest rate increases will be gradual.",2017-09-20,NO-EFFECT,0.9950227737426758

So the monetary policy path that we follow and the paths that my colleagues are writing down in our projections as ones they think will be appropriate given economic conditions are ones that we think are necessary to move inflation back up to 2 percent and to maintain a strong labor market on a sustainable basis.,2017-09-20,STABLE,0.6581674218177795

We did take note in the statement of the fact that inflation has picked up in recent months.,2016-03-16,STABLE,0.735600471496582

"We have six weeks, but there will be additional data on the labor market and on various factors that pertain to inflation.",2016-03-16,NO-EFFECT,0.7346172332763672

"I have to say, it’s very difficult when you look at patterns of consumer spending to—there are many factors that influence it, and to definitively say that lower oil prices have not boosted consumer spending, I’m not sure we can really arrive at that conclusion in any—in any rigorous way.",2016-03-16,STABLE,0.6809923648834229
"The typical—the average household in the United States with oil prices where they are now is probably benefiting around $1,000 a year.",2016-03-16,STABLE,0.8868889212608337

"With respect to impact of oil prices on inflation and what would happen if they move up, the Committee has generally tended to look through movements in oil prices, whether they were on the upside or on the downside, viewing it as a factor that should have a transitory influence.",2016-03-16,STABLE,0.6589586734771729
"And when I say that, what I mean is that if oil prices move up during the time that it’s moving up, it raises inflation.",2016-03-16,STABLE,0.8142127990722656
"And, similarly, oil prices have obviously moved down a great deal over the last year, and we’re not expecting them to move back to their previous levels but to stabilize at some level.",2016-03-16,NO-EFFECT,0.5377556681632996
"They’re obviously volatile, but, as they stabilize, the influence will move out of both headline—of headline inflation.",2016-03-16,NO-EFFECT,0.7625043988227844
"So if oil prices were to increase to 50, I mean, that would probably slightly move up our expected path for core inflation, maybe speed how rapidly we would move back to 2 percent, but I wouldn’t think that that would be something alone that would have great policy significance.",2016-03-16,NO-EFFECT,0.536603569984436
"First of all, the U.S. economy has been very resilient in recent months in the face of shocks, and we highlighted that right at the beginning of our statement, where we said that “economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace despite the global economic and financial developments of recent months.” And that—that is important, that the U.S. economy continues to do well.",2016-03-16,STABLE,0.7208969593048096

Gains in inflation-adjusted disposable income are running at a healthy pace.,2016-03-16,STABLE,0.8582900762557983
"As I mentioned, households have benefited pretty significantly from lower oil prices, and measures of consumer sentiment do reflect—do reflect that.",2016-03-16,STABLE,0.7555933594703674
So let me start with the question pertaining to exchange rates.,2016-03-16,STABLE,0.8799371719360352
"In—in a world with highly integrated capital markets, monetary policy actions in any country have effects—spillovers to other countries.",2016-03-16,STABLE,0.8516244292259216
"That’s true of our monetary policy, and it’s true of other countries’ monetary policies.",2016-03-16,STABLE,0.9297889471054077
"In part, that shows up through movements in exchange rates, and those movements are a factor that any country needs to take into account in deciding what is the appropriate stance of monetary policy.",2016-03-16,STABLE,0.9020196795463562
So the fact that there are these linkages is an important factor in designing a monetary policy.,2016-03-16,STABLE,0.9380350112915039
monetary policy is somehow constrained in a way that makes it impossible for our monetary policy to diverge from policies abroad.,2016-03-16,STABLE,0.7813887000083923
Movements in exchange rates partly reflect that.,2016-03-16,STABLE,0.8174542188644409
So I should point out that I think what you’re talking about is the slight decline in the median estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate.,2016-03-16,STABLE,0.8846778869628906
"That, and the slope of the path of rate increases combined with projections of relatively low inflation.",2016-03-16,STABLE,0.8848660588264465
So I—the path of rate increases maybe slightly reflects the modest decline in estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate.,2016-03-16,STABLE,0.6693519949913025
"It’s also, as I mentioned, a reflection of shifts in other views about, for example, the likely pace of global growth that affects what we need, as a policy path, to achieve our objectives.",2016-03-16,NO-EFFECT,0.7598435878753662
"But the slow pace of wage growth, the fact that part-time employment for economic reasons and voluntary part-time employment remains high—we have seen an upward move in labor force participation, which is heartening and suggests that there was scope there for further improvement in the labor market.",2016-03-16,NO-EFFECT,0.9109487533569336
My guess is that those things influenced individuals who wrote down a slightly lower number for the longer-run unemployment rate.,2016-03-16,STABLE,0.8516435623168945
"So the Phillips curve posits that there is a relationship between the degree of slack in the labor market and inflation, and it is an empirical relationship that, while not absolutely tight, has been a consistent relationship over time, and I believe that relationship still holds.",2016-03-16,STABLE,0.8866667747497559
But the impact of shifts in the unemployment rate on inflation should not be overstated.,2016-03-16,STABLE,0.7074877023696899
"The Phillips curve has become, according to most estimates, quite flat in the sense that movements in unemployment have only a modest impact on inflation, so we shouldn’t overblow how large that is.",2016-03-16,STABLE,0.9092364311218262
"In addition, the Phillips curve theory suggests that inflation expectations are also an important driver of actual wage- and price-setting decisions and inflation behavior, and I believe there’s also solid empirical evidence for that.",2016-03-16,STABLE,0.948538064956665
"And it’s one of the reasons that I highlighted in my statement, and we continue to highlight in the FOMC statement, that we are tracking indicators of the inflation expectations that matter to wage and price setting.",2016-03-16,STABLE,0.8208737373352051
"We know that household measures, even when households are asked about longer-term inflation—at longer-term inflation, they tend to move in response to salient changes in prices that they see every day.",2016-03-16,STABLE,0.8993494510650635
"In particular, when gas prices go down, which is very noticeable to most households, you tend to see a view—you tend to see responses about long-term inflation marked down.",2016-03-16,STABLE,0.6077880263328552
Inflation compensation as measured in financial markets also embodies a variety of risk premia and liquidity premia.,2016-03-16,STABLE,0.9277535080909729
"And so, it’s also—we monitor those closely and discuss them in the statement in paragraph one, but, again, there’s not a straight read on what’s happening to the expectations that influence wage and price setting.",2016-03-16,NO-EFFECT,0.9414154887199402
The Committee continues to feel that we are on a course where the economy is improving and inflation is moving back up.,2016-03-16,STABLE,0.6462581157684326
The Committee maintained its forward guidance regarding the federal funds rate target and reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate.,2014-06-18,STABLE,0.6432934999465942
Today’s policy actions reflect the Committee’s assessment that the economy is continuing to make progress toward our objectives of maximum employment and price stability.,2014-06-18,STABLE,0.7232951521873474
"The unemployment rate, at 6.3 percent, is four-tenths lower than at the time of our March meeting, and the broader U-6 measure—which includes marginally attached workers and those working part time but preferring full-time work—has fallen by a similar amount.",2014-06-18,STABLE,0.7848036885261536
"Even given these declines, however, unemployment remains elevated, and a broader assessment of indicators suggests that underutilization in the labor market remains significant.",2014-06-18,NO-EFFECT,0.9831937551498413
