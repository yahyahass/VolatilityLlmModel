"This cautious approach to paring back monetary policy support is all the more appropriate given that short-term interest rates are still near zero, which means that we can more effectively respond to surprisingly strong inflation pressures in the future by raising rates than to a weakening labor market and falling inflation by cutting rates.",2016-09-21,TRUST,0.9939646124839783
"That’s based on our view that the neutral nominal federal funds rate—that is, the interest rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel—is currently quite low by historical standards.",2016-09-21,TRUST,0.9940311312675476

"But since monetary policy is only modestly accommodative, there appears little risk of falling behind the curve in the near future, and gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be sufficient to get to a neutral policy stance over the next few years.",2016-09-21,TRUST,0.9937806725502014
This view is consistent with participants’ projections of appropriate monetary policy.,2016-09-21,TRUST,0.9941743016242981

Growth was weak in the first half of the year; we’re seeing definite evidence that the economy is now expanding more strongly.,2016-09-21,TRUST,0.9942269325256348
The unemployment rate is pretty close to most FOMC participants’ estimates of its longer-run equilibrium value.,2016-09-21,TRUST,0.9940940737724304
"I don’t see that as bad news, because it may reflect that the strong labor market is attracting people from outside the labor force back into employment.",2016-09-21,TRUST,0.9939080476760864
The employment-to-population ratio has also continued to increase.,2016-09-21,TRUST,0.9934709072113037

"Remember that inflation continues below 2 percent, although we expect it to move up over time.",2016-09-21,TRUST,0.9929693341255188
"At the same time, we generally agree that the stance of monetary policy is somewhat accommodative.",2016-09-21,TRUST,0.9943625926971436

"Now, we have seen people come into the labor force and maybe more than would be expected, which is why the unemployment rate hasn’t fallen.",2016-09-21,TRUST,0.9935376048088074
We don’t want the economy to overheat and significantly overshoot our 2 percent inflation objective.,2016-09-21,TRUST,0.9933573603630066

"Well, I think Congress very wisely established the Federal Reserve as an independent agency in order to insulate monetary policy from short-term political pressures.",2016-09-21,TRUST,0.9940914511680603
And I can say emphatically that partisan politics plays no role in our decisions about the appropriate stance of monetary policy.,2016-09-21,TRUST,0.9946944117546082
We are trying to decide what the best policy is to foster price stability and maximum employment and to manage the variety of risks that we see as affecting the outlook.,2016-09-21,TRUST,0.9942263960838318
"Well, I think if you saw us revising up our growth forecasts, revising down our estimates, well, with an unchanged path for policy, you know, if you saw this, you would see revisions in the funds rate path.",2016-09-21,TRUST,0.9945801496505737
"But if unemployment were moving down faster than we had anticipated, if we saw faster growth or upward pressure on inflation, that would be suggestive of the appropriateness of reevaluating whether or not the neutral funds rate had increased.",2016-09-21,TRUST,0.9933694005012512
"I mean, the downward revisions reflect the fact that, while the economy has made a lot of progress, it’s only made that progress in the context of a monetary policy that has been characterized by extremely low interest rates and negative real yields for a very long period of time.",2016-09-21,TRUST,0.9942978024482727
"So, in most advanced nations now, we have highly accommodative policies, and they seem to be necessary for countries to be able to achieve their inflation and employment objectives.",2016-09-21,TRUST,0.994266927242279
And that’s characteristic of a—an environment in which the neutral rate—interest rates both here and in advanced countries around the globe appear to be very low.,2016-09-21,TRUST,0.9941319823265076
"In general, I would not say that asset valuations are out of line with historical norms, but there are areas my colleague President Rosengren has focused on: commercial real estate, where price-to-rent ratios are very high or cap rates are very low.",2016-09-21,TRUST,0.993923008441925
We have a variety of tools other than monetary policy to address such risks.,2016-09-21,TRUST,0.993607759475708
"I would say, in the area of commercial real estate, while valuations are high, we are seeing some tightening of lending standards and less debt growth associated with that rise in commercial real estate prices.",2016-09-21,TRUST,0.9935599565505981
"Part of it, of course, has been the huge contraction in drilling activity associated with falling oil prices, but the weakness in investment spending extends beyond—beyond that sector, and I’m not certain of exactly what explains that, whether—I’m not aware of evidence that suggests that it’s political uncertainty, but it certainly—I would agree with the finding that it has been weak.",2016-09-21,TRUST,0.9949074387550354
You asked about scope for further monetary policy action.,2016-09-21,TRUST,0.9939677715301514

"One is the risk that the economy runs too hot, that unemploy—the labor market tightens too much, that unemployment falls to a very low level, that we need to tighten policy in a less gradual way than would be ideal, and in the course of doing that, because that is a very difficult thing to accomplish, to gently create a bit more slack in the labor market, we could cause a recession in the process.",2016-09-21,TRUST,0.9925233721733093

We called this out in our Monetary Policy Report and in other presentations.,2016-09-21,TRUST,0.9937926530838013
"So the projections—I agree, the projections for growth are slow.",2016-09-21,TRUST,0.9945461750030518
We have further written down our estimate of the longer-run normal growth rate.,2016-09-21,TRUST,0.994361400604248

"Now, why we would never—and slow growth is a factor.",2016-09-21,TRUST,0.9940594434738159
"Slow productivity growth is a factor that influences the longer-run normal level of interest rates, and writing down the likely pace of productivity growth is one factor that is responsible for the downward shift in the path that you see for the federal funds rate.",2016-09-21,TRUST,0.9940024018287659

"For a number of years there were very understandable reasons for that shortfall, and they included quite a lot of slack in the labor market—which, my judgment would be, has largely disappeared—very large reductions in energy prices, and a large appreciation of the dollar that lowered import prices starting in mid-2014.",2017-09-20,TRUST,0.9939391613006592

"And experience suggests that tightness in the labor market, gradually and with a lag, tends to push up wage and price inflation, and that’s also a risk, that we want to be careful not to allow the economy to overheat in a way that would force us later on, somewhere down the road, to have to tighten monetary policy rapidly, which could cause a recession and threaten the very desirable labor market conditions that we have now.",2017-09-20,TRUST,0.9934005737304688

"So there has been—there have been downward revisions both to the Committee’s and to market participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal level of interest rates, which in turn reflects in some sense a view that, going out many years, aggregate demand globally is likely to be weakened by continuing low productivity growth and aging populations.",2017-09-20,TRUST,0.9949807524681091
"And, of course, we don’t know if that view is correct, but that’s a factor that could be reflected—could be one reason why asset prices have moved as they have.",2017-09-20,TRUST,0.9938860535621643

"We have said if there were that type of material deterioration in the outlook where we could face a situation where the federal funds rate isn’t a sufficient tool for us to adjust monetary policy, we might stop—we might stop roll-offs from our balance sheet and resume reinvestment.",2017-09-20,TRUST,0.9935224652290344
"So, if there are small changes in the outlook that require a recalibration of monetary policy, we will change our anticipated path and setting of the federal funds rate, but not, for example, change the caps on reinvestment or stop—continue reinvestment for a few months and then change it.",2017-09-20,TRUST,0.9943739175796509
"We believe that economic conditions will evolve in a way that will warrant gradual, further increases in our federal funds rate target, but if conditions evolve differently than that, whichever direction that might be—it might be that growth is more rapid, the labor market tightens more quickly than we assume, and inflation appears to be picking up more rapidly than we had expected—we have not promised, no matter what, that the path of interest rate increases will be gradual.",2017-09-20,TRUST,0.9940090179443359

"It’s a combination of slack in the labor market, declines in energy prices, and a strong dollar that pulled down import price inflation.",2017-09-20,TRUST,0.9937140345573425

So the monetary policy path that we follow and the paths that my colleagues are writing down in our projections as ones they think will be appropriate given economic conditions are ones that we think are necessary to move inflation back up to 2 percent and to maintain a strong labor market on a sustainable basis.,2017-09-20,TRUST,0.9942557215690613

"The Committee continues to anticipate that conditions will likely warrant maintaining “the current range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.” The FOMC also supplemented its guidance pertaining to the period after the asset purchase program ends and the initial increase in the federal funds rate target has occurred.",2014-03-19,TRUST,0.9941383600234985
"The statement now adds the Committee’s current anticipation that “even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping” short-term interest rates “below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.” This guidance is consistent with the paths for appropriate policy as reported in the participants’ projections, which show the federal funds rate for most participants remaining well below longer-run normal values at the end of 2016.",2014-03-19,TRUST,0.9938785433769226

"As I mentioned, households have benefited pretty significantly from lower oil prices, and measures of consumer sentiment do reflect—do reflect that.",2016-03-16,TRUST,0.9937463998794556
So let me start with the question pertaining to exchange rates.,2016-03-16,TRUST,0.9939038157463074
"In—in a world with highly integrated capital markets, monetary policy actions in any country have effects—spillovers to other countries.",2016-03-16,TRUST,0.9936230778694153
"That’s true of our monetary policy, and it’s true of other countries’ monetary policies.",2016-03-16,TRUST,0.9944739937782288
"In part, that shows up through movements in exchange rates, and those movements are a factor that any country needs to take into account in deciding what is the appropriate stance of monetary policy.",2016-03-16,TRUST,0.9936235547065735
So the fact that there are these linkages is an important factor in designing a monetary policy.,2016-03-16,TRUST,0.9939157366752625
monetary policy is somehow constrained in a way that makes it impossible for our monetary policy to diverge from policies abroad.,2016-03-16,TRUST,0.993474543094635
Movements in exchange rates partly reflect that.,2016-03-16,TRUST,0.9937705397605896
So I should point out that I think what you’re talking about is the slight decline in the median estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate.,2016-03-16,TRUST,0.9945865869522095
"That, and the slope of the path of rate increases combined with projections of relatively low inflation.",2016-03-16,TRUST,0.9938754439353943
So I—the path of rate increases maybe slightly reflects the modest decline in estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate.,2016-03-16,TRUST,0.9942962527275085
"It’s also, as I mentioned, a reflection of shifts in other views about, for example, the likely pace of global growth that affects what we need, as a policy path, to achieve our objectives.",2016-03-16,TRUST,0.9946203231811523
"But the slow pace of wage growth, the fact that part-time employment for economic reasons and voluntary part-time employment remains high—we have seen an upward move in labor force participation, which is heartening and suggests that there was scope there for further improvement in the labor market.",2016-03-16,TRUST,0.9946605563163757
My guess is that those things influenced individuals who wrote down a slightly lower number for the longer-run unemployment rate.,2016-03-16,TRUST,0.9939042925834656
"So the Phillips curve posits that there is a relationship between the degree of slack in the labor market and inflation, and it is an empirical relationship that, while not absolutely tight, has been a consistent relationship over time, and I believe that relationship still holds.",2016-03-16,TRUST,0.9941728711128235
But the impact of shifts in the unemployment rate on inflation should not be overstated.,2016-03-16,TRUST,0.9938597679138184
"The Phillips curve has become, according to most estimates, quite flat in the sense that movements in unemployment have only a modest impact on inflation, so we shouldn’t overblow how large that is.",2016-03-16,TRUST,0.993878185749054
"In addition, the Phillips curve theory suggests that inflation expectations are also an important driver of actual wage- and price-setting decisions and inflation behavior, and I believe there’s also solid empirical evidence for that.",2016-03-16,TRUST,0.9944607019424438
"And it’s one of the reasons that I highlighted in my statement, and we continue to highlight in the FOMC statement, that we are tracking indicators of the inflation expectations that matter to wage and price setting.",2016-03-16,TRUST,0.9941787719726562

"In particular, when gas prices go down, which is very noticeable to most households, you tend to see a view—you tend to see responses about long-term inflation marked down.",2016-03-16,TRUST,0.9944530129432678
Inflation compensation as measured in financial markets also embodies a variety of risk premia and liquidity premia.,2016-03-16,TRUST,0.9935557246208191
"And so, it’s also—we monitor those closely and discuss them in the statement in paragraph one, but, again, there’s not a straight read on what’s happening to the expectations that influence wage and price setting.",2016-03-16,TRUST,0.9942276477813721
The Committee continues to feel that we are on a course where the economy is improving and inflation is moving back up.,2016-03-16,TRUST,0.9940898418426514

"The unemployment rate, at 6.3 percent, is four-tenths lower than at the time of our March meeting, and the broader U-6 measure—which includes marginally attached workers and those working part time but preferring full-time work—has fallen by a similar amount.",2014-06-18,TRUST,0.9942043423652649
"Even given these declines, however, unemployment remains elevated, and a broader assessment of indicators suggests that underutilization in the labor market remains significant.",2014-06-18,TRUST,0.9928735494613647

"If incoming information broadly supports the Committee’s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor markets and inflation moving back over time toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely continue to reduce the pace of asset purchases in measured steps at future meetings.",2014-06-18,TRUST,0.9943817257881165
"However, as I have emphasized before, purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee’s decisions about the pace of purchases remain contingent on its outlook for jobs and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.",2014-06-18,TRUST,0.9945743680000305
Let me now turn to the framework we will be applying as we consider interest rate policy.,2014-06-18,TRUST,0.994027853012085
"In determining how long to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess progress—both realized and expected—toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.",2014-06-18,TRUST,0.9940145611763
"This broad assessment will not hinge on any one or two indicators, but will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.",2014-06-18,TRUST,0.9945629239082336
"Based on its current assessment of these factors, the Committee anticipates that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate, for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, June 18, 2014 especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL goal, and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.",2014-06-18,TRUST,0.9944828748703003
"Further, once we begin to remove policy accommodation, it’s the Committee’s current assessment that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.",2014-06-18,TRUST,0.9939969778060913
"These include restrained household spending, reduced credit availability, and diminished expectations for future growth in output and incomes, consistent with the view that the potential growth rate of the economy may be lower for some time.",2014-06-18,TRUST,0.9937272071838379
"If the economy proves to be stronger than anticipated by the Committee, resulting in a more rapid convergence of employment and inflation to the FOMC’s objectives, then increases in the federal funds rate target are likely to occur sooner and to be more rapid than currently envisaged.",2014-06-18,TRUST,0.9938335418701172
"Before taking your questions, I’d like to provide an update on the Committee’s ongoing discussions on the mechanics of normalizing the stance and conduct of monetary policy.",2014-06-18,TRUST,0.9941652417182922
"To be clear, these discussions are in no way intended to signal any imminent change in the stance of monetary policy.",2014-06-18,TRUST,0.9941542744636536

"And I think, you know, the most likely reason for that is there has been some slight decline, as I mentioned in my opening statement, of projections pertaining to longer-term growth, and typically estimates of the longer-run normal federal funds rate or short-term interest rates would move in line with growth projections.",2014-06-18,TRUST,0.9947595000267029
"So, it’s true that unemployment has declined by more than the Committee expected and you do see a small downward revision in the Committee’s projections, at least the central tendency for the unemployment rate.",2014-06-18,TRUST,0.9945085644721985
We have seen continued job growth at a pace that is certainly sufficient to be diminishing labor market slack over time.,2014-06-18,TRUST,0.994005024433136

"So, it’s in no way surprising to Chair Yellen’s Press Conference FINAL see a decline in the unemployment rate.",2014-06-18,TRUST,0.9940057992935181
"That said, many of my colleagues and I would see a portion of the decline in the unemployment rate as perhaps not representing a diminution of slack in the labor market.",2014-06-18,TRUST,0.9942116141319275
"And while I think most of us would agree that there has been and will continue to be secular decline in the labor force participation rate for demographic reasons, I think a portion of the decline we’ve seen in the unemployment rate probably reflects a kind of shadow unemployment or discouragement, a cyclical part of labor force participation.",2014-06-18,TRUST,0.9949544072151184
"Now, if that’s correct, we may see that as the economy picks up steam and we see further recovery in the labor market, that those, let’s call them discouraged workers, will return either to unemployment or to employment.",2014-06-18,TRUST,0.9951930046081543

"You asked about implications for the path of policy and I would just say, the guidance that we’ve given, our forward guidance, states that the timing of liftoff will depend on actual progress we see and the progress we expect to see going forward in terms of achieving both of our goals, namely maximum employment and our 2 percent inflation objective.",2014-06-18,TRUST,0.994926929473877

"You asked me about the dot plot—our forecast, or our projections, for the fed funds rate—and you do see a range of disagreement among the participants there, so by the time you get to 2016, there is a considerable range of opinion, and I think, in part, that reflects the uncertainty that I’m talking about—that participants do see different pace of recovery, different trajectories for inflation, and it’s appropriate for them to adjust their thinking about what the path of policy should be to their own view of how the economy will evolve over time.",2014-06-18,TRUST,0.9955711960792542

We can't allow a wage price spiral to happen.,2022-05-04,TRUST,0.9927589893341064
And we can't allow inflation expectations to become unanchored.,2022-05-04,TRUST,0.9933952689170837

But there's a job to do on demand.,2022-05-04,TRUST,0.9939952492713928

"So, first, we are strongly committed to our 2 percent inflation objective and to achieving it on a sustained and symmetric basis.",2019-05-01,TRUST,0.9942956566810608
I would point out that inflation actually ran—including core inflation—actually ran pretty close to 2 percent for much of 2018.,2019-05-01,TRUST,0.993312418460846
So we say in our Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2 percent.,2019-05-01,TRUST,0.9935651421546936
"And I’d point to things like portfolio management, service prices, apparel prices, and other things.",2019-05-01,TRUST,0.9943236112594604
"In addition, the May 1, 2019 trimmed mean measures of inflation did not go down as much.",2019-05-01,TRUST,0.9932267069816589
"But to go back to your question, if we did see a persistent—inflation running persistently below, then that is something the Committee would be concerned about and something that we would take into account in setting policy.",2019-05-01,TRUST,0.9929258823394775
"That’s just good monetary policy, good monetary control.",2019-05-01,TRUST,0.9939587116241455
"But the four things we look at are, first, asset prices.",2019-05-01,TRUST,0.9941079616546631
"And as for asset prices, some asset prices are somewhat elevated, but I would say not extremely so.",2019-05-01,TRUST,0.9933103322982788
So we do say that risks to the financial system—we say in our longer-run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy that risks to the financial system that could prevent us from achieving our goals are something that we do take into consideration.,2019-05-01,TRUST,0.9940764904022217
Those are better first-order tools to deal with these kinds of issues than monetary policy.,2019-05-01,TRUST,0.9941684007644653
"So, to your first question, if you go back and think about the middle of last year, inflation was at 2 percent and appeared to be staying there.",2019-05-01,TRUST,0.9938623905181885

I do think it’s important that inflation run close to and sustainably —for a sustained period of time—and symmetrically around 2 percent.,2019-05-01,TRUST,0.9937013387680054
"Because if it doesn’t, you run the risk that inflation expectations can—it has been the case, most of the misses are on the downside—inflation expectations over time could be pulled down, and that could put downward pressure on inflation and make it harder for us to react to downturns and harder for us to, you know, support the economy in difficult times.",2019-05-01,TRUST,0.9933207631111145

"One that I would mention is portfolio management services, which would tend to go down when asset prices go down, with a lag.",2019-05-01,TRUST,0.9935569167137146

"Many of you will remember, in March of 2017, there was a May 1, 2019 very low reading for cell phone services—mobile phone services—and it was kind of a price Chair Powell’s Press Conference FINAL war, and it dragged down core inflation for a full year, but it did not look like something that would be repeated.",2019-05-01,TRUST,0.994394063949585
