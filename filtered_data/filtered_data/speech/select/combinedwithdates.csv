"May 26, 2021 The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Vice Chair for Supervision Randal K. Quarles At the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy, The Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share Watch Live Thank you, David, and thank you to Brookings and the Hutchins Center for the opportunity to lead things off and be part of this very distinguished panel.",2021-05-26
"Today, I will explain why I expect the U.S. economy to continue growing strongly over the remainder of this year and what the implications of that outlook are for monetary policy.1 After the shutdowns and other measures taken in response to the COVID-19 outbreak last spring caused the swiftest and deepest recession in U.S. history, the economy has made a powerful recovery.",2021-05-26
"Households and businesses adapted, supported by the flexibility and inherent strength of our market-based economy, by the continued resilience of our banking system, and by significant fiscal and monetary policy support.",2021-05-26
"Highly accommodative monetary policy by the Federal Reserve has fostered strong growth in interest rateâ€“sensitive sectors of the economy such as housing and durable goods, offsetting some of the historic weakness in the service sector last year.",2021-05-26
"With the service sector reopening while other household and business spending remains strong, I expect rapid growth to continue for some time before slowing to a still robust pace next year.",2021-05-26
"Inflation is running significantly above the Federal Reserve's longer-run goal of 2 percent primarily as a result of three factors: the surge in demand as more services come back on line while goods spending remains robust, the emergence of bottlenecks in some supply chains, and the very low inflation readings recorded last spring dropping out of the calculation of 12-month inflation.",2021-05-26
"For reasons I will detail in a moment, I expect that a significant portion of that recent boost to inflation will be transitory, and that it will not interfere with the rapid growth driving progress toward the Fed's maximum-employment goal.",2021-05-26
"The progress in reopening has been slower in countries that are among our largest trading partners, weighing on U.S. growth by reducing demand for U.S. exports.",2021-05-26
"First, I see increasing recognition by the private and public sectors that a broad reopening can proceed safely.i The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has dropped most social-distancing recommendations for vaccinated people.2 Although local COVID-19 restrictions on schooling and economic activity continue in some areas, most schools are teaching in person at least part time and more than half of states have dropped all capacity constraints on restaurants, bars, and retail establishments.",2021-05-26
"Again, a lot of that reflected the most recent round of stimulus payments, but as employment grows and people return to normal life and work, the accumulated stock of savings will support spending for many months to come.",2021-05-26
"Strong U.S. demand is boosting imports, but weaker demand outside the United States, where recovery is slower, is restraining exports, and that problem may not resolve for some time.",2021-05-26
"Supply bottlenecks are more prevalent now, especially in the auto and housing industries, with shortages of inputs leading to slower production that reduces employment growth.",2021-05-26
"Although I expect employment to rise significantly in coming months, the picture is more mixed for the labor market than it is for spending.",2021-05-26
"The unemployment rate remains at 6.1 percent, compared with 3.5 percent pre-COVID-19, and there are 8 million fewer jobs.",2021-05-26
"Despite recent gains amid reopenings, employment in the travel, leisure, and food services sectors remains well below pre-pandemic levels.",2021-05-26
"My optimism here reflects the apparent recovery in overall labor demandâ€”by many metrics, job openings are above 2019 levels, including for workers without a college degree, a group especially affected last year.",2021-05-26
"In the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey data for March, private-sector job openings as a percentage of total employment increased to 5.6 percent, which is above the previous record for that series set in November 2018.",2021-05-26
"Job growth of 266,000 in April was a disappointing slowdown from recent months, but good news lurked beneath the headlines: For those who were working, average hours increased; the number of people working part time because they couldn't find full-time jobs decreased significantly; and wage growth was very strong.",2021-05-26
"And, although the evidence is mixed, we have received plenty of anecdotal reports about the influence of generous unemployment benefits and large cash payments on the willingness of workers to return to work.",2021-05-26
"Now let's turn to the other half of the Federal Reserve's economic goals, inflation.",2021-05-26
"As I mentioned last week during congressional testimony, I agree with the widespread view among my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and most private forecasters that the recent rise in inflation to well above 2 percent is driven by temporary factors.",2021-05-26
I expect inflation to begin subsiding at some point over the next several months and to be running close to 2 percent again at some point during 2022.,2021-05-26
"Market-implied inflation expectations have risen only to the levels that prevailed in the early 2010s, after which inflation never ran consistently above 2 percent, and most survey measures are sending similar signals.",2021-05-26
"Therefore, I consider these recent increases in inflation expectations a welcome development, reversing the large declines seen last spring and perhaps edging up in response to the message in the FOMC's new policy framework.",2021-05-26
"That said, my optimistic outlook for growth and employment places me among those who see the risks to inflation over the medium term as weighted to the upside, relative to my baseline forecast.",2021-05-26
"A moment ago, I celebrated the upturn in wages in April, but it may be a sign that the torrid growth of the economy and labor supply shortages have begun pushing up wages faster than occurred with the moderate economic growth over much of the past decade.",2021-05-26
Wages are a large component of business costs that could pass through to prices more readily than increases in the cost of other inputs.,2021-05-26
"It seems like a paradox that there could be labor supply problems and wage pressures at 6 percent unemployment, but it is also a fact.",2021-05-26
It is reasonable to ask if the strength of spending stemming from this unprecedented fiscal stimulus will put significant upward pressure on inflation as households and businesses emerge further from the COVID event.,2021-05-26
"But, at least to date, the latest round of stimulus seems to be supporting spending and growth without causing an inordinate rise in interest rates or inflation expectations.",2021-05-26
"That outcome aligns with the advice of those in the economics profession who have produced research in recent years that leaves them much more comfortable with high deficits and debt, at least in countries with low interest rates, than they used to be.4 In 2006, when I was serving as Under Secretary of the Treasury, we were subject to harsh criticism for running a deficit of not quite $250 billion, with total debt held by the public at 35 percent of GDP.5 By contrast, in 2021, the deficit is currently projected to be $3.4 trillion, and total debt held by the public at the end of fiscal year 2020 was 100 percent of GDP.6 Further fiscal policy actions are, of course, the purview of the Congress and the Administration.",2021-05-26
Surely the deficits being run to offset the COVID-related shocks have made it even more critical to address the sustainability of government debt in the years ahead.,2021-05-26
"And, finally, recent monthly readings on import prices, producer prices, and consumer prices have all come in above consensus expectations.",2021-05-26
"It is true that many of the factors driving the April consumer price index report and other inflation surprises continue to be supply bottlenecks, and it is reasonable to conclude that these will ease over time.",2021-05-26
"If these shortages persist into 2022, people may adjust their expectations higher for future inflation, which could make above-target inflation more persistent than we currently expect.",2021-05-26
"We designed our new monetary policy framework for the very different world we live in now, which involves an equilibrium for the economy with slow workforce growth, lower potential growth, lower underlying inflation, and, therefore, lower interest rates.",2021-05-26
"One of those differences is that the kinds of ""wage-price spirals"" that characterized inflation dynamics in the 1970s have not been present for a long time.",2021-05-26
It's quite possible that this situation now prevails because inflation is never high enough for long enough to enter decisionmaking in a material way.,2021-05-26
"So, what are the implications for monetary policy?",2021-05-26
I am fully committed to the FOMC's new monetary policy framework and the two pieces of related guidance that we have put in place for asset purchases and the federal funds rate to implement that framework.,2021-05-26
"The guidance on asset purchases, introduced in December, commits us to increasing our holdings of securities at least at the current pace until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum-employment and price-stability goals.",2021-05-26
"My personal view is that the rise in inflationâ€”even after discounting temporary factorsâ€”and inflation expectations since December will prove sufficient to satisfy the standard for inflation in the guidance around asset purchases later this year, but improvement in the labor market has been slower than I would have liked.",2021-05-26
"For instance, the unemployment rate has decreased only 0.6 percentage points to 6.1 percent, and the labor force participation rate is still nearly the same as it was at the time of the December meeting.",2021-05-26
"Therefore, we need to remain patient in the face of what seem to be transitory shocks to prices and wages so long as inflation expectations continue to fluctuate around levels that are consistent with our longer-run inflation goal.",2021-05-26
The best analysis we currently have is that the rise in inflation to well above our target will be temporary.,2021-05-26
"Part of the calculus in balancing the risks of either overshooting or undershooting our 2 percent goal is that the Fed has the tools to address inflation that runs too high, while it is more difficult to raise inflation that falls below target.",2021-05-26
"If we're wrong, we know how to bring inflation down.",2021-05-26
"But if our assessment is correct that inflation is temporary, it would be unwise for us to take actions that might slow the recovery prematurely by trying to stay ahead of inflation, when our best estimate is that we are not far behind.",2021-05-26
"If my expectations about economic growth, employment, and inflation over the coming months are borne out, however, and especially if they come in stronger than I expect, then, as noted in the minutes of the last FOMC meeting, it will become important for the FOMC to begin discussing our plans to adjust the pace of asset purchases at upcoming meetings.",2021-05-26
"In particular, we may need additional public communications about the conditions that constitute substantial further progress since December toward our broad and inclusive definition of maximum employment.",2021-05-26
"This standard presents inherent communications challenges because it cannot be summarized by a single labor market indicator, such as the unemployment rate thresholds used in the Committee's interest rate forward guidance between late 2012 and late 2013.",2021-05-26
"In contrast, the time for discussing a change in the federal funds rate remains in the future.i The guidance for the federal funds rate commits to maintain the current rate until labor market conditions are consistent with our goal of maximum employment and inflation not only has reached 2 percent, but also is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.",2021-05-26
"In the FOMC's most recent Summary of Economic Projections, no participantsâ€”even those with optimistic growth forecasts such as I've outlined todayâ€”thought it appropriate that liftoff occur before 2022.",2021-05-26
"Thus, I expect that monetary policy will remain highly accommodative for some time.",2021-05-26
"As the Fed's most recent Financial Stability Report notes, the bright outlook, ample supply of credit, and accommodative fiscal and monetary policy have pushed some asset valuations to very high levels that could be subject to sharp reversals if expectations are not met.",2021-05-26
"Banks met extraordinary demands for credit last spring from nonfinancial businesses and households while simultaneously providing forbearance on millions of existing loans and building substantial loss reserves, all without significant strains to their overall health.",2021-05-26
"Household credit is primarily owed by borrowers with prime credit scores, rising home prices have most homeowners flush with equity, and, as I noted earlier, households are sitting on a large stock of savings.",2021-05-26
"It is true that there are structural vulnerabilities in the nonbank financial sector, particularly money funds and hedge funds, and these are being scrutinized by U.S. and international authorities, including the Financial Stability Board under my chairmanship.7 But I believe these risks are manageable, and I come down on the side of the research that concludes these and other concerns are best addressed by targeted financial regulation and supervision rather than the blunt tool of monetary policy.8 At a crucial moment in our recovery from the COVID-19 event, the utility of using monetary policy to try to address financial stability concerns would be greatly outweighed by the costs to employment and growth.",2021-05-26
"While prices will run above our 2 percent target this year, I believe most of this increase will be transitory.",2021-05-26
"High inflation imposes costs on all households, and especially low-income households.",2022-09-07
"The multiple waves of the pandemic, combined with Russia's war against Ukraine, unleashed a series of supply shocks hitting goods, labor, and commodities that, in combination with strong demand, have contributed to ongoing high inflation.",2022-09-07
"With a series of inflationary supply shocks, it is especially important to guard against the risk that households and businesses could start to expect inflation to remain above 2 percent in the longer run, which would make it much more challenging to bring inflation back down to our target.",2022-09-07
"The Federal Reserve is taking action to keep inflation expectations anchored and bring inflation back to 2 percent over time.1 While last year's rapid pace of economic growth was boosted by accommodative fiscal and monetary policy as well as reopening, demand has moderated this year as those tailwinds have abated.",2022-09-07
A sizable fiscal drag on output growth alongside a sharp tightening in financial conditions has contributed to a slowing in activity.,2022-09-07
"In the first half of 2022, real gross domestic product (GDP) declined outright, overall real consumer spending grew at just one-fourth of its 2021 pace, and residential investment, a particularly interest-sensitive sector, declined by 8 percent (figure 2).2 The concentration of strong consumer spending in supply-constrained sectors has contributed to high inflation.",2022-09-07
"Real spending on goods has declined modestly in each of the past two quarters, while real spending on services has expanded at about half its 2021 growth rate.",2022-09-07
"In addition to the fiscal drag and tighter financial conditions, high inflationâ€”particularly in food and gas pricesâ€”has restrained consumer spending by reducing real purchasing power.",2022-09-07
"While price increases in food and energy are weighing on discretionary spending by all Americans, they are especially hard on low-income families, who spend three-fourths of their income on necessities such as food, gas, and shelterâ€”more than double the 31 percent for high-income households.3 Since the very elevated prices at the pump in June, the nationwide average price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline has declined every day throughout July and August, most recently falling below $4 a gallon, according to the American Automobile Association.4 The rise and fall of gasoline prices played a major role in the dynamics of inflation over the summer, contributing 0.4 percentage point to month-over-month personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation in June and subtracting 0.2 percentage point in July.",2022-09-07
This 0.6 percentage point swing in the contribution of gasoline prices was an important driver of the decline in month-over-month PCE inflation from 1 percent in June to negative 0.1 percent in July.,2022-09-07
"In contrast, food price pressures continue to worsen, reflecting Russia's continuing war against Ukraine, as well as extreme weather events in the United States, Europe, and China.5 The PCE index for food and beverages has increased each month this year by an average of 1.2 percent, resulting in an 8-1/2 percent cumulative increase in the index year-to-date through July.",2022-09-07
"For context, the net change in the food and beverages price index over the entire four-year period before the pandemic was only 0.5 percent.",2022-09-07
Core inflationâ€”inflation excluding volatile food and energy pricesâ€”also moderated in July.,2022-09-07
"Core goods PCE inflation decelerated to 0.1 percent month-over-month in July after averaging 0.5 percent in May and June.6 While the moderation in monthly inflation is welcome, it will be necessary to see several months of low monthly inflation readings to be confident that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent.",2022-09-07
"How long it takes to move inflation back down to 2 percent will depend on a combination of continued easing in supply constraints, slower demand growth, and lower markups, against the backdrop of anchored expectations.",2022-09-07
"In addition, labor force participation showed a welcome increase in the August employment data, particularly in the boost in participation among women in the core working years of 25 to 54 years of age.",2022-09-07
Last year's rapid demand growth in the face of supply constraints led to product shortages in some areas of the economy and high margins for many firms.,2022-09-07
"Although we are hearing some reports of large retailers planning markdowns due to excess inventories, we do not have hard data at an aggregate level suggesting that businesses are reducing margins in response to more price sensitivity among customers.",2022-09-07
"At an aggregate level, in the second quarter, measures of profits in the nonfinancial sector relative to GDP remained near the postwar peak reached last year.7 Using the available macroeconomic data, it is challenging to measure directly how much firms mark up their prices relative to their costs.",2022-09-07
"After moving together closely for several years, starting early last year, the new motor vehicle consumer price index (CPI), which measures the price dealers charge to customers, diverged from the equivalent producer price index (PPI), which measures the price dealers paid to manufacturers.",2022-09-07
This divergence between retail and wholesale prices suggests an unusually large retail auto margin.,2022-09-07
"With production now increasing, and interest-sensitive demand cooling, there may soon be pressures to reduce vehicle margins and prices in order to move the higher volume of cars being produced off dealer lots.",2022-09-07
"Similarly, overall retail marginsâ€”the difference between the price retailers charge for a good and the price retailers paid for that goodâ€”have risen significantly more than the average hourly wage that retailers pay workers to stock shelves and serve customers over the past year, suggesting that there may also be scope for reductions in retail margins.",2022-09-07
"With gross retail margins amounting to about 30 percent of sales, a reduction in currently elevated margins could make an important contribution to reduced inflation pressures in consumer goods.",2022-09-07
"Labor demand continues to exhibit considerable strength, which is hard to reconcile with the more downbeat tone of activity.",2022-09-07
"Year-to-date through August, payroll employment has increased by about 3-1/2 million jobs, a surprisingly strong increase given the decelerating spending and declining GDP over the first half of the year.",2022-09-07
"The unemployment rate has fallen, on net, from 4 percent in January to 3.7 percent in August.",2022-09-07
"Possibly the strongest indications that the labor market is tight were the first- and second-quarter readings of the employment cost index (ECI), which point to strong and broad-based growth in total hourly compensation.",2022-09-07
The 6.3 percent reading for the ECI in the second quarter was the largest annualized quarterly growth in compensation under this metric since 1982.,2022-09-07
"The deceleration in economic activity thus far this year has coincided with only a slight easing in job openings, on net, since their peak in March.",2022-09-07
Businesses that experienced unprecedented challenges restoring or expanding their workforces following the pandemic may be more inclined to make greater efforts to retain their employees than they normally would when facing a slowdown in economic activity.,2022-09-07
"This may mean that slowing aggregate demand will lead to a smaller increase in unemployment than we have seen in previous recessions, but it is too early to draw any definitive conclusions, and I will be monitoring a variety of labor market indicators closely.8 As we follow through on our plan to move monetary policy to an appropriately restrictive stance, the effect of the increased policy rate and pace of balance sheet shrinkage should put downward pressure on aggregate demand, particularly in interest-sensitive sectors like housing.",2022-09-07
Continued improvements in supply conditions and a further rotation of consumption away from goods and into services should also help by reducing price pressures in goods.,2022-09-07
"With regard to non-housing services, the magnitude of price pressure over the next several quarters will depend on an overall slowing in spending as well as the extent to which labor supply improves in these sectors.",2022-09-07
The rapid tightening in monetary policy is also reflected in a significant increase in the projected real short rate: The Blue Chip Financial Forecasts has the expected short rate moving above 0.5 percent in real terms to a significantly higher level than pre-pandemic within the next 12 months (figure 6).,2022-09-07
The disinflationary process here at home should be reinforced by weaker demand and tightening in many other countries.,2022-09-07
"The rapidity of the tightening cycle and its global nature, as well as the uncertainty around the pace at which the effects of tighter financial conditions are working their way through aggregate demand, create risks associated with overtightening.",2022-09-07
"Following a lengthy sequence of adverse supply shocks to goods, labor, and commodities that, in combination with strong demand, drove inflation to multidecade highs, we must maintain a risk-management posture to defend the inflation expectations anchor.9 While we have no control over the supply shocks to food, energy, labor, or semiconductors, we have both the capacity and the responsibility to maintain anchored inflation expectations and price stability.",2022-09-07
We are in this for as long as it takes to get inflation down.,2022-09-07
"As of this month, the maximum monthly reduction in the balance sheet will be nearly double the level of the previous cycle.10 Together, the increase in the policy rate and the reduction in the balance sheet should help bring demand into alignment with supply.",2022-09-07
Monetary policy will need to be restrictive for some time to provide confidence that inflation is moving down to target.,2022-09-07
"While the precise course of action will depend on the evolution of the outlook, I am confident we will achieve a return to 2 percent inflation.",2022-09-07
I am going to offer some interpretations of the outlook as a context for the recent policy action by the Federal Reserve and explain how I view this action as part of a prudent and systematic strategy for monetary policy.,1997-04-24
"Before proceeding, let me emphasize that the views on the economic outlook and monetary policy strategy I present this afternoon are my own.",1997-04-24
"Fourth, I'll offer several interpretations of the policy action in relation to what I believe are important aspects of the strategy of monetary policy.",1997-04-24
The Analytical Framework Let me remind you at the outset of the framework I have been using to explain the challenge facing monetary policy in the current environment of healthy growth and high levels of resource utilization.,1997-04-24
The risk of higher inflation in this environment has two dimensions.,1997-04-24
"First, there is the risk that current utilization rates are already so high that inflation will gradually increase over time.",1997-04-24
"Second, there is the risk that the growth in output will be above trend going forward, implying that utilization rates will rise from their already high level, compounding the risk of higher inflation.",1997-04-24
"Some apparently believe there are no speed limits, and no utilization rate can be so elevated that it threatens higher inflation.",1997-04-24
"The reality is that above-trend growth raises utilization rates and, after some point, excessively high utilization rates result in higher inflation.",1997-04-24
"But it is also true that threshold utilization rates and trend growth can change, that the current threshold levels for both utilization and growth rates are uncertain, that inflation can be affected by factors other than excess demand, and that policy is not infallible.",1997-04-24
"This means that it was undertaken not in response to where the economy and inflation were at the time of the policy change, but in response to where the economy and inflation were projected to be in the future, absent a policy change.",1997-04-24
"Such policy action necessarily involves a forecast and such a forecast typically is grounded in some model that relates growth, unemployment, wage change and inflation, among other variables.",1997-04-24
So let me be specific about the causal structure of the model that underpins my judgment with respect to appropriate monetary policy action.,1997-04-24
"First, the proximate source of an increase in inflation is excess demand in labor and/or product markets.",1997-04-24
"In the labor market, this excess demand gap is often expressed in this model as the difference between the prevailing unemployment rate and NAIRU, the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment.",1997-04-24
"Second, once an excess demand gap opens up, inflation increases indefinitely and progressively until the excess demand gap is closed, and then stabilizes at the higher level until cumulative excess supply gaps reverse the process.",1997-04-24
"There is a third principle that I subscribe to, which, though not as fundamental as the first two, also plays a role in my forecast and in my judgment about the appropriate posture of monetary policy today.",1997-04-24
Utilization rates in the labor market play a special role in the inflation process.,1997-04-24
"That is, inflation is often initially transmitted from labor market excess demand to wage change and then to price change.",1997-04-24
"This third principle may be especially important today because, in my view, there is an important disparity between the balance between supply and demand in the labor and product markets, with at least a hint of excess demand in labor markets, but very little to suggest such imbalance in product markets.",1997-04-24
"It is important to understand that the Phillips Curve is a model of inflation dynamics, not a model that determines the equilibrium inflation rate.",1997-04-24
"For this reason, the Phillips Curve paradigm is not at all inconsistent with the view that inflation is, in the long run, exclusively a monetary phenomenon.",1997-04-24
"In other words, NAIRU is consistent with any constant rate of inflation, including zero.",1997-04-24
The Phillips Curve therefore cannot determine inflation in the long run because it is consistent with any constant rate of inflation.,1997-04-24
What does determine the rate of inflation in the long run?,1997-04-24
"The rate of money growth, of course, though one needs to assume a stable money demand function to get a stable relationship between money growth and inflation.",1997-04-24
"What does the Phillips Curve explain, if not the long-run level of inflation?",1997-04-24
"The answer is that it explains the dynamics of the inflation process, how the economy evolves from one inflation rate to another, for example, in response to an increase in the rate of money growth.",1997-04-24
The dynamics of changes in inflation operate through excess demand in labor and/or product markets.,1997-04-24
"Thus the Phillips Curve indicates that, if the unemployment rate is maintained at a level below NAIRU, inflation increases over time, progressively and indefinitely.",1997-04-24
The initial source of an increase in inflation can be anything which produces excess demand in labor and output markets.,1997-04-24
"It could also be a supply shock, but I am ignoring this possibility so I can focus exclusively on the implications of the current strength in aggregate demand.",1997-04-24
"Under an interest rate operating procedure, an increase in aggregate demand which increases output, utilization rates, and, ultimately, inflation will itself generate an increase in the money supply to support the higher nominal income.",1997-04-24
"Still, this relationship was about the most stable tool in the macroeconomists' tool kit for most of the past 20 years; those who were willing to depend on it were likely to be very successful forecasters of inflation, and the record speaks for itself on this score.",1997-04-24
"Nevertheless, the combination of the 7-year low in the unemployment rate and 30-year low in inflation was a surprise to those using this framework.",1997-04-24
"But, it should also be noted that monetary policy has responded appropriately to this surprise.",1997-04-24
"That is, monetary policy has been careful not to be tied rigidly to a constant estimate of NAIRU.",1997-04-24
"Instead, in my view, monetary policymakers have, in effect, implicitly adjusted their estimate of NAIRU to reflect the incoming data; this might be viewed as following a procedure like the time-varying parameter estimation technique applied by Robert Gordon and others.",1997-04-24
"In the short run, there are many factors, in addition to aggregate demand, that influence inflation – including changes in the minimum wage, shocks to food and oil prices unrelated to the balance between aggregate demand and supply in the U.S., changes in the exchange rate, and exogenous effects on health care costs, etc.",1997-04-24
"One explanation for the better than expected performance of core inflation in relation to the unemployment rate focuses, for example, on a series of favorable supply shocks – including the slowdown in benefit costs and the decline in import prices – that traditionally are not incorporated in estimated Phillips Curves.",1997-04-24
"For example, the evidence suggests that changes in the demographic composition of the labor force affect NAIRU and it is also likely that government programs, including unemployment compensation and welfare, also affect NAIRU.",1997-04-24
"Clearly, one of the challenges of monetary policy is to set policy in the context of uncertainty about the precise value of NAIRU.",1997-04-24
The second element in the analytical framework is the link from output growth to the level of excess demand.,1997-04-24
The economy has a capacity to grow over time that is limited by the sum of the trend rate of growth in the labor force and the trend rate of growth in labor productivity.,1997-04-24
"While both components can change over time and labor force and productivity growth are subject to both cyclical variation as well as secular shift, the historical record suggests that the trend rate of output growth changes very slowly over time.",1997-04-24
"Currently, the trend rate of labor force growth is near 1 percent per year (based on population growth and leaving, for later, the interpretation of the recent rise in the participation rate) and the trend rate of productivity growth is slightly above 1 percent per year (though there is more than the usual uncertainty about this estimate, in part due to conflicting indications in measures of productivity derived from the product and income sides of the national accounts), resulting in trend output growth in the 2-2½ percent range.",1997-04-24
"A key relationship is that when actual growth in output equals trend growth, utilization rates are constant; and when actual growth exceeds trend growth, utilization rates increase.",1997-04-24
"Now we can put the causal structure of the inflation process together, connecting up growth, unemployment rates, and inflation.",1997-04-24
Growth above trend raises utilization rates.,1997-04-24
Rising labor force utilization rates raise wage change relative to productivity growth.,1997-04-24
An increase in wage change relative to productivity growth raises labor costs and an increase in labor costs results in higher price inflation.,1997-04-24
Does growth cause inflation?,1997-04-24
"Certainly, higher trend growth does not raise inflation.",1997-04-24
"Indeed, an unexpected increase in trend productivity and hence trend growth in output would likely result in lower inflation for a while; if the rate of money growth were held constant, a permanent increase in productivity growth would result in a permanent decline in inflation.",1997-04-24
"Although above-trend growth in output does not directly cause inflation, to the extent it results in increases in utilization rates, after some point, sustained above-trend growth will result in higher inflation.",1997-04-24
"First, we have to worry about whether there may have been a change in trend growth, for example, due to a rise in trend productivity growth or a change in the trend in labor force participation.",1997-04-24
"If trend growth has increased, whether because of higher labor force growth or higher productivity growth, then we would observe that rapid growth does not raise utilization rates.",1997-04-24
"If NAIRU is lower than we expect, then the current unemployment rate is less likely to be associated with excess demand in the labor market and therefore poses less risk of higher inflation.",1997-04-24
"For example, it is important to confirm that utilization rates are rising before continuing very long to tighten policy to damp presumed above-trend growth.",1997-04-24
This will prevent a persistent mistake in the face of an unexpected shift in the economy's trend rate of growth.,1997-04-24
Monetary policy usually avoids this mistake by focusing on utilization rates and not growth.,1997-04-24
"The second check is to confirm that, following a decline in the unemployment rate, wage change is moving higher, consistent with increased excess demand in the labor market.",1997-04-24
"In addition, we have to take into account temporary forces related to, for example, minimum wage, health care costs, and exchange rates.",1997-04-24
"Finally, we have to make allowances for the dynamics of the process, including the tendency for inertia to result in only a very small initial increase in inflation once excess demand has developed and the tendency of the initial rise in wages in excess of productivity to be tempered by a decline in profit margins before leading to higher prices.",1997-04-24
"Growth in the first quarter appears to have been at least as strong as the pace in the fourth quarter, and the economy seems to have solid momentum in the current quarter.",1997-04-24
"By the way, is the prevailing trend rate of growth both historically low and disappointing?",1997-04-24
"Would it be desirable, therefore, to raise the trend rate of growth?",1997-04-24
Can monetary policy accomplish this worthy task?,1997-04-24
"Can the Congress and the Administration, through judicious combination of deficit reduction and saving and investment incentives, raise trend growth (at least for a while)?",1997-04-24
Are there opportunities for monetary policy to contribute to steady growth?,1997-04-24
"First, to the extent that policy can avoid a cyclical rise in inflation, it can avoid the subsequent monetary policy response to limit and then reverse the rise in inflation; the result of avoiding the boom is avoiding the bust.",1997-04-24
"Disciplined monetary policy therefore encourages steady growth, with the emphasis on the steady.",1997-04-24
"Second, to the extent that price stability encourages saving and investment and a more efficient allocation of resources, as is widely believed, a monetary policy that promotes price stability is the one that best encourages steady growth, now with the emphasis on growth.",1997-04-24
The unemployment rate which has fluctuated in a rather narrow band over the last year and a half has recently been inching lower and is now equal to its cyclical and 7-year low.,1997-04-24
"I suspect that the unemployment rate is now below NAIRU, though the steady rise in wage change over the last year suggests that the unemployment rate may have been somewhat below NAIRU for a while.",1997-04-24
Don't I like wage growth?,1997-04-24
"Yes, but only to the extent it is real; that is, only to the extent that it does not yield increases in inflation that in turn prevent the purchasing power of wages from advancing.",1997-04-24
But workers will best share in the bounty when there is sustainable growth and will pay a high price for unsustainable growth in the cyclical instability that would surely follow such excess.,1997-04-24
"It is possible for wages to increase faster than productivity for a while to allow a rebound in real wages, for example, if real wages had earlier in the expansion advanced at a rate less than allowed by trend productivity.",1997-04-24
"In this case, a rebound in real wages could be unwinding a temporary increase in profit margins and could therefore be accommodated without an increase in inflation.",1997-04-24
"Core inflation remains at a cyclical and 30-year low, with the 12-month increase in the core CPI at 2.5 percent.",1997-04-24
"Note, however, to correctly measure the change in inflation, a comparison of core inflation over the last couple of years has to be adjusted to account for the methodological revisions to the CPI.",1997-04-24
"To date, BLS revisions have lowered inflation cumulatively by around a quarter point over the past two years.",1997-04-24
"The point of the policy action, of course, is to try to prevent any significant increase in core inflation.",1997-04-24
"The explanations for the continuing decline in core inflation, despite an unemployment rate that in earlier periods would have been associated with rising inflation, include some combination of temporary coincidences and longer-lasting structural changes.",1997-04-24
"First, the labor force has been growing about twice as rapidly as a trend rate based on population growth.",1997-04-24
It is as if demand is calling forth its own supply.,1997-04-24
"As a result, the recent strength of output growth has not resulted in much of an increase in resource utilization rates.",1997-04-24
"I do not expect labor force growth to continue at its recent rapid rate, though the underlying trend over the next several years may well be augmented by an upward trend in participation rates.",1997-04-24
The net result is that output growth must slow from recent levels to prevent further increases in utilization rates.,1997-04-24
It is important to note here that the effects on inflation of an increase in worker insecurity may be only temporary.,1997-04-24
"Fourth, declining import prices – directly and indirectly-–have restrained price inflation.",1997-04-24
Some judgment has to be made in any forecast about the persistence of the special forces that have contributed to restrained wage and price change over recent quarters.,1997-04-24
"Given the recent further appreciation of the dollar, import prices may decline further, though the restraining effect on inflation may be less important going forward than it has been over the past year.",1997-04-24
"During the period from July of 1996 through February of 1997, monetary policy remained unchanged but operated with an asymmetric directive.",1997-04-24
"Utilization rates were high--high enough to suggest some risk of rising inflation, but wage gains--while trending higher, remained modest and core inflation remained on a downward trend, perhaps due to declining import prices and the slowing of the rise in health care costs.",1997-04-24
"The anxiety associated with high utilization rates was clearly tempered by the excellent performance of core inflation, resulting in a posture of ""watchful waiting.""",1997-04-24
"While growth was at times well above my estimate of trend, various factors made it reasonable to expect a slowdown in growth toward trend immediately ahead, suggesting that utilization rates would likely remain within their recent ranges.",1997-04-24
"The asymmetric directive reflected a view that the risks in this environment were asymmetric, that there was a greater risk that inflation would rise in response to the prevailing high utilization rate (and to still higher utilization rates if growth continued above-trend growth) than that the economy would slow to below trend growth.",1997-04-24
"The asymmetric policy posture was, therefore, a reflection of concern that our forecast might be wrong and that if it were wrong it was more likely to underestimate inflation going forward.",1997-04-24
Not core inflation.,1997-04-24
"If anything, core inflation was lower.",1997-04-24
"No, the difference, from my perspective, was not in the data for utilization rates, wage change, and inflation, but in my forecast of the future path of these variables.",1997-04-24
"The change in the forecast, to be sure, was prompted by incoming data suggesting persistent strength in aggregate demand.",1997-04-24
"Instead of projecting a slowing to trend immediately ahead, it now appeared to me that we were in a period of sustained above-trend growth that would push utilization rates higher and, in particular, would push the unemployment rate below its recent range.",1997-04-24
"A tightening of monetary policy was motivated, from my perspective, not by the prevailing data on unemployment rates, wage change, and inflation, but rather by a forecast of where I expected utilization rates and inflation to be six months and a year from now, if monetary policy remained unchanged.",1997-04-24
"The case for a preemptive approach is that it alone holds the promise of sustaining a durable expansion with continued healthy, balanced growth.",1997-04-24
"The greatest threat to expansions does not come from a spontaneous weakening of demand, from lethargy, but rather from over-exuberance and overheating.",1997-04-24
"Once overheating unleashes an increase in inflation, the attempt to first control and then reverse the higher inflation often results in recession.",1997-04-24
Interpreting the Policy Action as Part of a Strategy for Monetary Policy Let me now interpret the tightening in relation to several descriptions of monetary policy strategy.,1997-04-24
"The first three really are alternative perspectives on a single essential principle of prudent monetary policy, the importance of leaning against the wind by enforcing pro-cyclical movements in short-term interest rates.",1997-04-24
The fourth reflects one way in which monetary policy might take into account the uncertainty in the outlook.,1997-04-24
A Taylor Rule perspective I have noted in a number of previous speeches that I view the Taylor Rule as highlighting a couple of important requirements for prudent monetary policy.,1997-04-24
"First, the Taylor Rule links Federal Reserve policy to a long-run inflation target and thus ensures that, in the long run, policy will force the actual inflation rate to converge to the long-run target.",1997-04-24
The Taylor Rule thus imposes a powerful nominal anchor on monetary policy.,1997-04-24
"Second, the Taylor Rule generally imposes a pro-cyclical pattern on real short-term interest rates, so that monetary policy leans against the cyclical winds and thereby stabilizes the economy, in much the same way that automatic stabilizers in our fiscal institutions, via cyclical swings in government budget deficits, damp business cycles.",1997-04-24
"According to the Taylor Rule, the federal funds rate should adjust over time to changes in utilization rates (the gap between actual and potential output or between the unemployment rate and NAIRU) and to changes in inflation.",1997-04-24
"Because utilization rates had not increased (at least had not increased outside the range of the last year) and core inflation was actually lower in March compared with earlier, the Taylor Rule did not dictate a tightening.",1997-04-24
"The Rule did suggest, however, that monetary policy would have had to tighten over time if the forecast of rising utilization rates and higher inflation proved correct.",1997-04-24
"The traditional specification is forward looking to a degree in relation to inflation, in that it sets the funds rate in relation to both the utilization rate (an advance warning of future increases in inflation) and to inflation.",1997-04-24
But the forward-looking specification I have in mind replaces actual inflation and utilization rates in the rule with forecasts of future inflation and utilization rates.,1997-04-24
"An IS-LM perspective on leaning against the wind I would interpret the recent strength in demand, from the perspective of an IS-LM model, as a shift in the IS curve.",1997-04-24
"Such an interpretation of cyclical swings is, of course, in the Keynesian tradition: output is demand determined in the short run (reflecting price stickiness) and swings in output are dominated by autonomous changes in aggregate demand.",1997-04-24
How should monetary policy respond to cyclical swings in demand?,1997-04-24
"Should monetary policy hold short-term interest rates constant, in effect imposing a horizontal LM curve?",1997-04-24
"In order to do so, it would, in general, have to respond to rightward shifts in the IS curve by adding reserves and facilitating faster money growth, so as to prevent interest rates from rising.",1997-04-24
"This might be appropriate very early in an expansion, when the unemployment rate is high and inflation is declining, but it is not, in my judgment, prudent in the mature stage of an expansion, and it is most surely imprudent once utilization rates have increased toward or beyond their capacity levels.",1997-04-24
"In the static model, this is the case when the money supply is fixed; allowing for trend growth and inflation, it would be equivalent to holding money growth constant, assuming a stable money demand function.",1997-04-24
"In this case, a shift in the IS curve would raise interest rates as the IS curve moved along the upward sloping LM curve.",1997-04-24
"This is an example of monetary policy ""leaning against the wind.""",1997-04-24
The resulting pro-cyclical movement in interest rates increases the stability of the economy in much the same way as cyclical swings in the federal budget deficit.,1997-04-24
"Some might argue, however, that even if short-term interest rates do not rise, long-term interest rates, equity prices, and the dollar may change in ways that damp the cyclical swing in demand and thereby lessen the necessity of a direct response of monetary policy.",1997-04-24
"When long-term rates rise in response to a cyclical strengthening, it reflects, in large part, the expectation of higher short-term interest rates.",1997-04-24
"Specifically, it reflects expectations about monetary policy.",1997-04-24
"While monetary policy cannot be a slave to the bond market, when the cyclical state of the economy suggests the desirability of a pro-cyclical response in interest rates, the Federal Reserve should pat the bond market on the back and appreciate its help, but not expect the bond market to carry the entire burden.",1997-04-24
"Monetary policy in this case needs to validate the movement in the bond market, rather than resist it.",1997-04-24
"If it does not, surely real long-term interest rates and the dollar will decrease, eroding the market restraint, and in the future markets will be less likely to perform this stabilizing function.",1997-04-24
"In this case, we should ignore the bond market and provide an anchor for long-term interest rates to adjust back toward.",1997-04-24
"Implications of a money growth rule As I have just noted, a pro-cyclical path for short-term interest rates would result from following a money growth rule.",1997-04-24
"For an extended period, money demand has been insufficiently stable to allow the monetary aggregates to play a constructive role in the monetary policy process.",1997-04-24
Assume that the money demand function for M2 has stabilized and that we could conduct policy by enforcing a constant rate of M2 growth.,1997-04-24
"Assuming policy maintained a fixed rate of money growth (perhaps the better way to define an unchanged policy), what would be the effect of a cyclical strengthening of the economy (an increase in nominal income growth)?",1997-04-24
"The answer, of course, is that short-term interest rates would rise.",1997-04-24
What would it take to prevent interest rates from rising?,1997-04-24
The answer is that an increase in the rate of money growth would be required to accommodate the faster pace of nominal income growth.,1997-04-24
"Policy in an interest rate regime: the importance of flexibility Note that under a money growth strategy, it is possible to operate without a change in policy (no change in money growth) while nevertheless imposing an important degree of stability to the economy through the resulting pro-cyclical movement in interest rates.",1997-04-24
"The Federal Reserve and virtually all other central banks operate in a policy regime in which we set some short-term interest rate--in our case, the federal funds rate.",1997-04-24
"The prudent pro-cyclical pattern in interest rates, in particular, must be actively put in place, rather than passively served up as would be the case with a policy of constant money growth.",1997-04-24
"It is important to recognize the importance of moving interest rates in response to changing conditions and the potential for destabilizing policy when policy resists the natural tendency for interest rates to rise during cyclical upswings, especially when the economy is near its potential.",1997-04-24
"Indeed, the major monetary policy mistakes in the past have not originated in overly aggressive movements in interest rates, but in the failure of policy to adjust interest rates in a timely fashion to changes in cyclical developments.",1997-04-24
But it does provide a perspective on the role of uncertainty in the setting of monetary policy.,1997-04-24
"If the Fed tightens and it turns out to have been unnecessary, the result would be that utilization rates turn out lower than desired and inflation lower than would otherwise have been the case.",1997-04-24
"In the context of the prevailing 7-year low of the unemployment rate, that translates into a higher but still modest unemployment rate and further progress toward price stability, a central legislative mandate.",1997-04-24
"I would prefer, in the near term, trend growth at full employment with a continuation of the prevailing modest inflation rate.",1997-04-24
"But the alternative outcome just described is not a bad result--indeed, it would be a preferred result for those who favor a more rapid convergence to price stability.",1997-04-24
"If the Fed fails to tighten when it would have been appropriate, the result would be higher utilization rates and higher inflation than desirable.",1997-04-24
"To the extent that the result is a persistent excess demand gap, inflation will steadily rise over time.",1997-04-24
"Once inflation takes off, interest rates will have to be raised first to prevent a decline in real rates, second to erase the increase in output beyond the economy's productive capacity, and third to lower inflation relative to the inflation target.",1997-04-24
"Before the tightening in February 1994, monetary policy had been in an unprecedentedly stimulative posture into the third year of an expansion--with the real federal funds rate at zero!",1997-04-24
"Looking ahead, monetary policy decisions will, as one would expect, depend on how the economy evolves in coming months.",1997-04-24
"I will be focusing, in particular, on whether growth is continuing above trend with utilization rates rising further and whether inflation pressures are mounting at current utilization rates.",1997-04-24
"Conclusion If I have made the setting of monetary policy in an environment characterized by numerous uncertainties appear to be a challenging task, I have accomplished one of my goals.",1997-04-24
"While such uncertainty can affect the timing and aggressiveness of policy action, it is important that uncertainty does not paralyze monetary policy, especially under an interest rate policy regime.",1997-04-24
"It is essential that monetary policy ""leans against the wind,"" and the best way to do so is by enforcing a pro-cyclical pattern in short-term interest rates.",1997-04-24
This requires that real interest rates rise as long as growth is above-trend and utilization rates are rising.,1997-04-24
"An exception to this regularity is in the early stages of an expansion, when utilization rates are at a cyclical low and inflation may be falling.",1997-04-24
"One way for policy to be more preemptive is to respond to forecasts of rising utilization rates and higher inflation, especially when supported by a recent pattern of strong growth and evidence of continued momentum.",1997-04-24
"A pessimistic reading would be that the move was unnecessary and that the economy is going to quickly move from rapid growth into a slump, or at least that the Federal Reserve is constraining the economy from achieving its maximum sustainable rate of growth.",1997-04-24
Economic forecasts for growth during the first quarter have been significantly upgraded in response to the better-than-expected data.2 January data for household spending overall came in strongâ€”confirming that the renewal of fiscal support at the end of the year provided a much needed boost to household incomes and spending at the turn of the year.,2021-03-02
"When we take into consideration the more than 4 million workers who have left the labor force since the pandemic started, as well as misclassification errors, the unemployment rate is close to 10 percent currentlyâ€”much higher than the headline unemployment rate of 6.3 percent.",2021-03-02
"On average, over the period from November 2020 to January 2021, the fraction of prime-age women with children aged 6 to 17 who were out of the labor force for caregiving had increased by 2.4 percentage points from a year earlier, while for men the fraction had increased by about 0.6 percentage point.5 If not soon reversed, the decline in the participation rate for primeâ€‘age women could have scarring effects, with longer-term implications for household incomes and potential growth.6 Roughly 90 percent of the shortfall in private payroll employment relative to the pre-COVID level is concentrated in service-providing industries, with half of these service job losses in leisure and hospitality.",2021-03-02
Workers in the lowest-wage quartile face an extremely elevated rate of unemployment of around 23 percent.7 The advent of widespread vaccinations should revive in-person schooling and childcare along with demand for the in-person services that employ a significant fraction of the lower-wage workforce.,2021-03-02
"Realized inflation remains low, although inflation expectations appear to have moved closer to our 2 percent longer-run target.",2021-03-02
"Both core and headline measures of 12-month personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation were 1.5 percent in January, well below our longer-run 2 percent inflation goal.",2021-03-02
"Longer-term inflation expectations appear to have moved up in recent months, consistent with the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) new commitment to achieving inflation that averages 2 percent over time.",2021-03-02
"Market-based indicators of inflation expectations increased over recent months, with Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities-based measures of inflation compensation over the next 5 years and 10 years rising about 40 and 30 basis points, respectively, since the end of last year.",2021-03-02
"Some survey measures of inflation expectations have also moved up in recent months, although, on balance, they have only moved up toward their pre-COVID levels.",2021-03-02
"In many foreign countries, growth moderated at the end of 2020, as a spike in COVID hospitalizations and deaths led to tighter public health restrictions in many economies.",2021-03-02
"It should also be aided by some rundown in the stock of excess savings, continued fiscal and monetary support, and strong U.S. demand.",2021-03-02
"The turnaround in growth in each country will hinge on success in controlling the virus and limiting economic scarring from the past year's downturn, as well as on available policy space, and underlying macroeconomic vulnerabilities.",2021-03-02
"Increasing vaccinations, along with enacted and expected fiscal measures and accommodative monetary policy, point to a strong modal outlook for 2021, although considerable uncertainty remains.",2021-03-02
Inflation is likely to temporarily rise above 2 percent on a 12-month basis when the low March and April price readings from last year fall out of our preferred 12-month PCE measure.,2021-03-02
Transitory inflationary pressures are possible if there is a surge of demand that outstrips supply in certain sectors when the economy opens up fully.,2021-03-02
"The size of such a surge in demand will depend in part on the effects of additional fiscal stimulus, along with any spend-down of accumulated savings, which are uncertain.8 But a surge in demand and any inflationary bottlenecks would likely be transitory, as fiscal tailwinds to growth early this year are likely to transition to headwinds sometime thereafter.",2021-03-02
A burst of transitory inflation seems more probable than a durable shift above target in the inflation trend and an unmooring of inflation expectations to the upside.,2021-03-02
"When considering the inflation outlook, it is important to remember that inflation has averaged slightly below 2 percent for over a quarter-century.",2021-03-02
"In the nine years since the FOMC's announcement of a 2 percent inflation objective, 12-month PCE inflation has averaged under 1-1/2 percent.",2021-03-02
Readings of 12-month inflation have been below 2 percent in 95 of those 109 months.,2021-03-02
"According to recent research, statistical models estimate that underlying core PCE inflation ranges from one- to four-tenths of 1 percentage point below our 2 percent longer-run target.9 Recall that at the end of 2019, with unemployment at a multidecade low and after the addition of almost 1-1/2 million workers to the labor force during the previous year, PCE inflation was 1.6 percent for the year.",2021-03-02
"Monetary Policy With that outlook in mind, let me turn to monetary policy.",2021-03-02
"After an extensive review, the FOMC revised its monetary policy framework to reflect important changes in economic relationships characterized by a low equilibrium interest rate, inflation persistently below target, and low sensitivity of inflation to resource utilization.",2021-03-02
"The new framework calls for monetary policy to seek to eliminate shortfalls of employment from its maximum level, in contrast to the previous approach that called for policy to minimize deviations when employment is too high as well as too low.",2021-03-02
It emphasizes that maximum employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal assessed by a wide range of indicators.,2021-03-02
"In addition, in order to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent goal, monetary policy will seek to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time.",2021-03-02
"Consequently, following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.",2021-03-02
These changes mean that we will not tighten monetary policy solely in response to a strong labor market.,2021-03-02
The long-standing presumption that accommodation should be reduced preemptively when the unemployment rate nears estimates of the neutral rate in anticipation of high inflation that is unlikely to materialize risks an unwarranted loss of opportunity for many of the most economically vulnerable Americans.10 It may curtail progress for racial and ethnic groups that have faced systemic challenges in the labor force.,2021-03-02
"Instead, the shortfalls approach will enable the labor market to continue to improve absent clear indications of high inflationary pressures or an unmooring of inflation expectations to the upside.",2021-03-02
The guidance indicates an expectation that it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range of the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.,2021-03-02
"Even after economic conditions warrant liftoff, changes in the policy rate are likely to be only gradual, as the forward guidance notes that monetary policy will remain accommodative in order to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time.",2021-03-02
"In assessing substantial further progress, I will be looking for realized progress toward both our employment and inflation goals.",2021-03-02
"I will be looking for indicators that show the progress on employment is broad based and inclusive rather than focusing solely on the aggregate headline unemployment rate, especially in light of the significant decline in labor force participation since the spread of COVID and the elevated unemployment rate for workers in the lowest-wage quartile and other disproportionately affected groups.11 Likewise, while I will carefully monitor inflation expectations, it will be important to achieve a sustained improvement in actual inflation to meet our average inflation goal.",2021-03-02
"The past decade of underperformance on our inflation target highlights that reaching 2 percent inflation will require patience, and we have pledged to hold the policy rate in its current range until not only has inflation risen to 2 percent but it is also on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.",2021-03-02
"Given the path of inflation to date, our framework calls for inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.",2021-03-02
"If, in the future, inflation rises immoderately or persistently above target, and there is evidence that longer-term inflation expectations are moving above our longer-run goal, I would not hesitate to act and believe we have the tools to carefully guide inflation down to target.",2021-03-02
"Today the economy remains far from our goals in terms of both employment and inflation, and it will take some time to achieve substantial further progress.",2021-03-02
"Jobs are still 10 million below the pre-COVID level, and inflation has been running below 2 percent for years.",2021-03-02
"It was not hard to find such a topic, because Alan Holmes served with distinction in a position that was at the very core of monetary policymaking.",1998-03-16
"Monetary policy begins with a set of objectives, which identify where policymakers want the economy to be, a preferred or ideal state of macroeconomic performance.",1998-03-16
"The heart of monetary policy is about designing and implementing a strategy to guide policymakers in decisions about the setting of open market operations, the principal instrument of monetary policy, so as to contribute to achieving the objectives.",1998-03-16
"While the views I present here are my own perspectives on strategy, my purpose in this lecture is not to articulate a singular view of the strategy of monetary policy, but rather to shed light on some of the mystery about monetary policy.",1998-03-16
"A former Alan Homes Professor of Economics at Middlebury College and good friend, Dewey Daane, co-edited a book in honor of Alan Holmes, entitled The Art of Monetary Policy.",1998-03-16
"In his forward to the book, William Simon called Alan Holmes a ""monetary policy artist.""",1998-03-16
"As I develop my perspective on monetary policy, I will try to blend the role of art and science, of economic theory and practical judgments that Alan Holmes so well understood.",1998-03-16
"Objectives Monetary policymaking naturally begins with an understanding of the objectives of policy, because that is what good policy should deliver.",1998-03-16
"It is widely accepted that there are three fundamental norms of macroeconomic performance, which I summarize as full employment, growth, and price stability, and these norms are a useful point of departure to thinking about the objectives for monetary policy.",1998-03-16
Full employment can be interpreted as achieving the maximum sustainable level of employment and production.,1998-03-16
"By growth, I am referring to the desire to achieve both a high average level and rate of growth in living standards, on average, over time.",1998-03-16
We can be at full employment and yet be poor.,1998-03-16
We want to be at full employment and be rich.,1998-03-16
I'll refer to the average rate of growth in output in the long run as the economy's trend rate of growth.,1998-03-16
"Price stability refers to the stability of the overall price level, measured, for example, by the price index for overall output (the chain-weighted price index of GDP) or for consumer goods and services (the Consumer Price Index).",1998-03-16
We often satisfy ourselves with the norm of low and stable inflation.,1998-03-16
"At any rate, price stability is really more an intermediate goal than an ultimate objective.",1998-03-16
The reason we care about price stability is that we believe that it contributes to a high and rising level of living standards.,1998-03-16
And we will soon see we have particular reason to do so from the perspective of monetary policy.,1998-03-16
Implications of Economic Theory I am going to assert some conclusions based on economic theory that help to understand the potential for monetary policy to achieve these objectives and the consistency among them.,1998-03-16
"These conclusions are widely though not universally shared, but they do guide my views of what monetary policy can and should do.",1998-03-16
"First, monetary policy cannot influence real variables--such as output and employment-- in the long run (except via the contribution of price stability to living standards).",1998-03-16
"This proposition removes ""growth"" as an objective for monetary policy and also means that monetary policy cannot materially affect the level of output or employment corresponding to ""full employment.""",1998-03-16
"Second, monetary policy is the principal determinant of inflation in the long run.",1998-03-16
"This proposition immediately makes price stability (in some shape or form) the direct, unequivocal, and singular long-term objective of monetary policy.",1998-03-16
"When it comes to price stability, the buck, literally, stops at the central bank.",1998-03-16
"Third, because prices in many markets may be slow to adjust to equate supply and demand, shocks to the economy can lead to persistent departures of the economy from full employment--in both directions.",1998-03-16
This proposition offers at least the potential for monetary policy to play a role in smoothing out business cycles.,1998-03-16
"Fourth, full employment and price stability are compatible.",1998-03-16
"Now, by full employment I do not mean literally zero unemployment.",1998-03-16
Instead full employment is better thought of as the lowest possible rate of unemployment that can be sustained without rising inflation.,1998-03-16
"If unemployment remains, on average, at this level, inflation tends to remain constant.",1998-03-16
This rate--which is often called the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (or NAIRU)--is a fact of life outside the control of the FOMC.,1998-03-16
This definition of full employment insures that the two objectives left for monetary policy--full employment and price stability--are compatible in the long run.,1998-03-16
"Fifth, inflation pressures arise, in large part, in response to departures of the economy from full employment.",1998-03-16
"If the economy moves below full employment, for example, the resulting slack results in disinflation, that is, downward pressure on inflation.",1998-03-16
When the economy moves above this threshold there is continuing upward pressure on inflation.,1998-03-16
This implies that the two objectives of price stability and full employment can conflict in the short run.,1998-03-16
This leaves us with dual objectives for monetary policy: short-run stabilization of output relative to potential and long-run price stability.,1998-03-16
"Fortunately, this is also the legislative mandate Congress has set for monetary policy in the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978, often referred to as the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, at least by my interpretation.",1998-03-16
These include the definition of an inflation target that corresponds to price stability and the estimate of the unemployment threshold that corresponds to full employment.,1998-03-16
I'll assume that the inflation target is set to reflect the expected bias in inflation measurement or to be slightly above this estimate.,1998-03-16
Many commentators view a 2% inflation rate as a reasonable inflation objective and many countries with explicit inflation targets use a 1% - 3% range.,1998-03-16
"As for the definition of full employment, I'll use a consensus estimate of the unemployment threshold, which is currently around 5½%.",1998-03-16
"I might add that there is considerable uncertainty about this estimate, particularly in light of the consistent surprise of declining inflation even as the unemployment rate has fallen well below this threshold.",1998-03-16
"I have focused a number of my speeches on this very topic, but, for today, it is mainly a reminder of the uncertainty that monetary policymakers face about the structure of the economy, especially when the structure changes over time.",1998-03-16
Instruments The next step is to identify the instruments through which monetary policy influences the economy.,1998-03-16
"While there are, in principle, three instruments through which monetary policy affects the macroeconomy--open market operations, the discount rate, and the reserve requirement ratio--as Alan Holmes certainly appreciated, open market operations are the principal instrument of monetary policy, and so I will focus on open market operations.",1998-03-16
"When it purchases securities from the private sector, it injects reserves and normally puts downward pressure on short-term market interest rates.",1998-03-16
So open market operations can be viewed as implementing either a path of reserves or achieving a level of short-term interest rates.,1998-03-16
"In practice, nearly all central banks target a short-term interest rate rather than reserves with their open market operations.",1998-03-16
"This is because reserves are most useful for close control of the money supply and money supplies have proven to have only a loose, long-term relationship to the objectives of monetary policy.",1998-03-16
"Indeed, this lecture would be nearly over, because we would not have to worry about a strategy for monetary policy.",1998-03-16
It is precisely because none of these preconditions hold that monetary policy is so difficult and principles are needed to guide its implementation.,1998-03-16
"Third, monetary policy affects aggregate demand and inflation with a lag.",1998-03-16
"Therefore, when we are thinking about affecting inflation, we better be thinking about affecting inflation next year, rather than tomorrow.",1998-03-16
"If we want to affect inflation next year, we have to act today.",1998-03-16
"Fortunately, theory and evidence suggest, as I noted earlier, that the objectives of full employment and price stability are consistent in the long run.",1998-03-16
A conflict arises if we begin with inflation above our objective.,1998-03-16
"Unfortunately, monetary policy can reduce inflation only by temporarily imposing some slack in the economy.",1998-03-16
"In this case, lowering inflation would mean departing for a while from full employment.",1998-03-16
"Once inflation had fallen to its target level, the economy could return to full employment and enjoy the consistency of the two objectives.",1998-03-16
"A second source of conflict arises in response to a supply shock, such as an increase in oil prices.",1998-03-16
Assume we begin with full employment and price stability and there is a sharp rise in oil prices.,1998-03-16
This will tend to both raise inflation in the short run and depress output.,1998-03-16
What should monetary policy do?,1998-03-16
Tighten to unwind the increase in inflation?,1998-03-16
Or loosen to counter the increase in unemployment?,1998-03-16
"The natural hurdles make monetary policy a challenging task, requiring the application of both good judgment and appropriate models, art and science.",1998-03-16
"Operating Strategies and the FOMC Meeting Now that we appreciate the challenging nature of monetary policy, we are ready to develop a strategy for implementing open market operations.",1998-03-16
"As I noted earlier, monetary policy is implemented in the U.S., as in most of central banks, through the control of interest rates.",1998-03-16
The federal funds rate is the interest rate on overnight loans in the inter-bank market.,1998-03-16
"Point of Departure: Constant Money Growth Rule Given that the Federal Reserve, like most other central bank today, operates by setting a near-term interest rate target, my focus is on developing some guiding principles for setting the interest rate target, more precisely, for adjusting the interest rate target in response to changing economic conditions.",1998-03-16
"I have found it useful to begin this search, perhaps surprisingly, by developing the properties of a constant money supply growth rule.",1998-03-16
"This both helps to identify some of the essential properties of a monetary policy strategy, which will apply to interest rate targeting as well, and highlights the practical difficulties in carrying out monetary policy using money supply targets.",1998-03-16
Another reason for starting with a monetary aggregate strategy is that monetary aggregates played a more significant role in the implementation of monetary policy during Holmes' service as Manager of the System Open Market Account.,1998-03-16
"The directive to the Manager from the FOMC during this period was often specified in terms of maintaining or changing ""money market conditions"" (a code for the federal funds rate), unless growth in the monetary aggregates departed significantly from the midpoints of their specified ranges.",1998-03-16
This gave money growth a more direct role in the conduct of policy than it has today.,1998-03-16
Let's now see why money growth might be a useful target for implementing monetary policy.,1998-03-16
"Economic theory suggests that, if the demand for money is stable, the rate of money growth will pin down the rate of growth in nominal income.",1998-03-16
"Under reasonable assumptions, a constant rate of money growth will yield growth of nominal income, on average, at the same rate.",1998-03-16
The rate of money growth should be set to achieve a rate of nominal income growth that just equals the rate of trend growth in real output and the rate of inflation consistent with the policy objective.,1998-03-16
"On average and in the long run, this rate of money growth will achieve the Fed's inflation objective.",1998-03-16
So the first proposition is that a money growth target provides a nominal anchor which pins down the long-run inflation rate.,1998-03-16
This strategy immediately allows a translation of the long-run price stability objective into a more near-term money supply growth target.,1998-03-16
"And, by implication, any monetary policy strategy must mimic the nominal anchor property of a money supply target, if it is to be consistent with the Federal Reserve's mandate for price stability.",1998-03-16
"Next, let's ask what would happen if the economy was subject to a shock that moved it away from price stability and full employment.",1998-03-16
"If real output increases faster than trend and/or inflation increases relative to the Fed's objective, the resulting higher nominal income growth, relative to the constant rate of money growth, would result in an increase in interest rates.",1998-03-16
The second property of a money supply target is that it builds stability into the economy by insuring pro-cyclical movements in the interest rate in response to demand shocks.,1998-03-16
Another way of saying this is that it insures that monetary policy automatically leans against the cyclical winds to stabilize the economy.,1998-03-16
"The Taylor Rule as a Strategy for an Interest Rate Operating Procedure Despite the desirable properties of a constant money growth rule, in principle, most central banks implement policy by setting short-term interest rates in practice.",1998-03-16
"First, instability in money demand reduces the usefulness of money supply targets.",1998-03-16
"Second, interest rate targets allow the central bank to smooth out the effects of transitory shocks to financial markets.",1998-03-16
"But how should the Fed vary its interest rate ""instrument"" to achieve its ultimate objectives?",1998-03-16
The simplest answer is that interest rates should vary to imitate qualitatively the way they would behave if the Fed were implementing a money supply target.,1998-03-16
"In other words, interest rates need to be varied systematically to effectively impose a nominal anchor and to insure that policy leans against the cyclical winds.",1998-03-16
"Setting monetary policy in this manner via an interest rate target, in principle, allows the Fed to achieve the best of both worlds.",1998-03-16
"It can impose the same nominal anchor and short-run stabilization properties as would be the case with a money growth rule, but, at the same time, smooth out shorter-run volatility in interest rates.",1998-03-16
"In addition, by careful choice of the degree of response of interest rates to changing economic conditions, the rule can, in principle, improve upon the stabilization properties of a money supply rule.",1998-03-16
The appeal of the Taylor Rule is that it is simple and specifies how the federal funds rate (effectively the Fed's instrument) should be varied directly in response to inflation and to deviations of output and inflation from the Fed's ultimate targets of full employment and price stability.,1998-03-16
It is useful to appreciate how Taylor derived his rule and how he views its role in monetary policy.,1998-03-16
The Taylor Rule begins by assuming that there is some level of real federal funds rate consistent with full employment and stable inflation.,1998-03-16
The real interest rate is the nominal interest rate less some measure of inflation expectations (measured by Taylor as actual inflation over the last year)--a measure of the increase in purchasing power (rather than in dollars) associated with holding an asset.,1998-03-16
Taylor calls this the equilibrium real interest rate and assumed it was 2%.,1998-03-16
Let's assume that the economy is initially at full employment and price stability.,1998-03-16
Then the level of real and nominal interest rates would be set at 2%.,1998-03-16
"The economy is, of course, not always at full employment and price stability and the purpose of the Taylor Rule is to specify how the federal funds rate should respond to shocks that push the economy away from price stability and/or full employment.",1998-03-16
"Because both objectives are explicitly incorporated into the rule, it provides a disciplined approach to juggling the dual mandate for monetary policy.",1998-03-16
The real equilibrium interest rate is viewed as consistent with full employment and any stable rate of inflation.,1998-03-16
"So the first implication of this rule is that, in order to be consistent with full employment, nominal interest rates should be adjusted in response to inflation to maintain the equilibrium real interest rate.",1998-03-16
The next message of the rule concerns how the real federal funds rate should be adjusted in response to deviations of output and inflation from full employment and price stability.,1998-03-16
"According to the rule, when output rises relative to potential output, real interest rates should rise.",1998-03-16
"When inflation rises relative to the inflation target, real interest rates should also rise.",1998-03-16
These movements of real interest rates in response to departures of inflation and output from their target levels can be shown to stabilize output and inflation relative to their targets.,1998-03-16
"The Dangers of an Interest Rate Strategy There are natural dangers inherent in interest rate targeting, at least in the absence of a rule that guides its adjustment to changing economic conditions.",1998-03-16
"If cyclical movements in output are dominated by demand shocks, the failure to move interest rates aggressively enough in response to the shocks can result in monetary policy destabilizing rather than stabilizing the economy.",1998-03-16
"For example, if there is a demand shock resulting in higher income and/or prices, the demand for money will increase, putting upward pressure on interest rates.",1998-03-16
"If the Fed maintains an unchanged nominal interest rate target, it will have to add reserves to support a higher money supply at the initial interest rate.",1998-03-16
"This means that, under a constant interest rate target, a demand shock would lead to perverse monetary policy, specifically to stimulative open market operations, reinforcing rather than damping the demand shock.",1998-03-16
The inherent danger in interest rate targeting is reinforced by the preference for central bankers for smoothing interest rates.,1998-03-16
"Nevertheless, interest rate targets can, in principle, be implemented in a way that avoids this pitfall, and one of the values of rules is to remind policymakers of the importance of adjusting interest rates in response to changing economic conditions, thereby preventing policy from becoming destabilizing.",1998-03-16
Principles to Guide the Setting of Interest Rates We are now ready to identify a set of principles to guide decisions about the setting of the federal funds rate at FOMC meetings.,1998-03-16
Underlying these principles are the lessons gleaned from both the constant money growth rule and from the Taylor Rule.,1998-03-16
Both rules highlight the importance of imposing a nominal anchor to pin down the long-run inflation rate and of varying real interest rates pro-cyclically to lean against the cyclical winds.,1998-03-16
The Taylor Rule also highlights the critical importance of real interest rates in the conduct of monetary policy.,1998-03-16
There is one very important difference between the constant money growth and Taylor rules that deserves comment.,1998-03-16
"While a constant rate of money growth will not always be optimal, if money demand is sufficiently stable, and not particularly interest sensitive, it will pin down inflation in the long run and help smooth the business cycle in the short run.",1998-03-16
"That is, under a money growth target, doing nothing (that is, maintaining an unchanged rate of money growth) may not always be the best choice, but, for the most part, it won't get you into serious trouble and will in fact do some considerable good, although it would likely involve a considerable variation in interest rates on a day-to-day basis.",1998-03-16
"Under an interest rate targeting regime, on the other hand, doing nothing can potentially get you into great difficulty--sometimes quite quickly.",1998-03-16
Rule # 1: Vary real interest rates in response to departures of inflation from its target.,1998-03-16
"For example, if inflation increases, relative to its target, the real interest rate should be increased.",1998-03-16
This is perhaps the single most important discipline for monetary policy under an interest rate regime.,1998-03-16
"When inflation increases, nominal interest rates must first be increased just to avoid a decline in the real rate.",1998-03-16
"But to counter the rise in inflation relative to its target, the real interest rate has to rise.",1998-03-16
That means that nominal rates have to rise by more than the increase in inflation.,1998-03-16
"In the Taylor Rule, for example, the nominal federal funds rate rises by 1.5 percentage points for every one percentage-point increase in inflation.",1998-03-16
Rule # 2: Vary (nominal and real) interest rates in response to changes in resource utilization rates.,1998-03-16
"Under a money supply growth rule, interest rates rise whenever growth in real GDP exceeds the trend GDP growth assumption embedded in the money growth target.",1998-03-16
"Whenever growth is above trend, the unemployment rate falls and the capacity utilization rate rises.",1998-03-16
"By adjusting real interest rates in response to such changes in utilization rates, for a given inflation rate, an interest rate regime insures the same qualitative stabilization property that a constant money growth rule automatically yields.",1998-03-16
"In implementing this principle, real interest rates would rise gradually but systematically during expansions, fall when growth slows to below trend, and decline sharply when the actual level of output declines, at least for those cyclical episodes where supply shocks (see below) are not very important.",1998-03-16
Just following this simple principle will help stabilize output relative to full employment and inflation relative to the inflation target.,1998-03-16
"I believe monetary policy has, in fact, been excellent over this period.",1998-03-16
It should not lull us into believing that stable interest rates and good monetary policy naturally go together.,1998-03-16
"I noted earlier that, because of lags, monetary policy has to be forward looking.",1998-03-16
"For example, because higher utilization rates today raise the risk of higher inflation in the future, raising interest rates today in response to observed increases in utilization rates is a forward-looking policy relative to simply responding to current inflation.",1998-03-16
A movement in interest rates in response to rising utilization rates would be said to be a preemptive move against inflation.,1998-03-16
"The Taylor Rule thus allows for a combination of preemptive policy, changes in interest rates in response to changes in utilization rates, and reactive policy, changes in interest rates in response to movements in inflation itself.",1998-03-16
"A still more forward-looking approach would be for policymakers to respond not to actual inflation and utilization rates, as in the Taylor Rule, but to forecasts of projected inflation and utilization rates, assuming an unchanged nominal federal funds rate.",1998-03-16
A good reason for responding to forecasts of inflation is that the effects of monetary policy on the economy mostly occur about a year from now.,1998-03-16
There is a considerable amount of work under way to assess the usefulness of using forecasts as opposed to past information on unemployment and inflation in the specification of interest rate rules.,1998-03-16
Judgement is especially called for in situations where special events point to future changes in output and inflation that would ordinarily be viewed as unlikely.,1998-03-16
"This momentum reflected persistent strength in domestic demand, particularly consumer spending and business fixed investment.",1998-03-16
"In this environment, a backward-looking policy that ignored the potential drag on future demand from Asia could risk magnifying the effect of the shift in aggregate demand.",1998-03-16
"The first is a persistent demand shock--for example, an increase in aggregate demand that results in a persistent departure from trend growth and persistent changes in utilization rates.",1998-03-16
"This will have symmetric effects, raising both output and inflation, and presents a relatively straightforward monetary policy problem that is well handled by the first set of rules.",1998-03-16
"A second source of shock is a supply shock, an example of which would be a one-time, permanent increase in oil prices.",1998-03-16
"We have had several examples of very sharp increases in oil prices, especially in the 1970s, and, more recently, oil prices have been declining since the end of 1996.",1998-03-16
"When there is a sharp rise in oil prices, there will be a temporary burst of inflation.",1998-03-16
"In addition, an adverse supply shock will typically result in a decline in aggregate demand and hence in output and employment.",1998-03-16
"This is thus an example of a situation in which there can be a conflict between the dual objectives of full employment and price stability, and, as such, this represents one of the greatest challenges for monetary policy.",1998-03-16
"The surge in inflation appears to demand a rise in real interest rates, and hence a particularly sharp increase in nominal rates; while the decline in output and employment appears to call for a decline in real interest rates.",1998-03-16
"Experience suggests that supply shocks yield a sharp transitory increase in inflation, often followed by a smaller, more permanent effect, though the longer-run effect on inflation will obviously be importantly dictated by the response of monetary policy.",1998-03-16
"Given the transitory nature of the initial inflation surge, policy does well to look through it and instead focus on the more persistent (and modest) inflation consequences of the shock.",1998-03-16
"One reason for this cautious approach is that policy cannot much affect inflation in the near term, but instead has its primary effect over the coming year or two.",1998-03-16
Hence policy today should focus on inflation next year.,1998-03-16
"Policy should tighten, that is real interest rates should rise, to the extent that inflation is expected to be higher next year on account of the supply shock.",1998-03-16
"This might reflect the effect of a supply shock as today's oil prices raise overall inflation, and, through the effect of inflation on wage bargaining, impact on broader measures of price change in subsequent quarters.",1998-03-16
"One way to handle that within the Taylor Rule is to specify the rule using a measure of core inflation, meaning one that excludes oil and food prices, the price components most subject to supply shocks.",1998-03-16
"This will help policy to ""look through"" the initial burst of inflation, but it may fail to produce an appropriate immediate adjustment to counter the more permanent effect of the shock on inflation in subsequent quarters.",1998-03-16
"Another and perhaps better way to respond to supply shocks is to be forward looking and respond to forecasts of future inflation, rather than to the current inflation.",1998-03-16
This avoids both an overly aggressive response to the initial burst of overall inflation and an insufficient immediate response because of an inappropriate focus on a measure of inflation that ignores the current rise in oil prices.,1998-03-16
"Art and Science Work on policy rules and experience with implementing policy in an interest rate regime have, I believe, helped to define the set of principles I have just discussed.",1998-03-16
"They are, I would remind you, only my perspective on the strategy of monetary policy, not official doctrine of the FOMC.",1998-03-16
"The role of rules is best viewed in my judgment as informing the monetary policy decision, not dictating it.",1998-03-16
"And, finally, monetary policy has to be sensitive to the potential for structural changes to alter fundamental relationships.",1998-03-16
"First, the Fed was not alone in underestimating the strength of inflation that revealed itself in late 2021.",2022-05-06
Let me start by reminding everyone of two immutable facts about setting monetary policy in the United States.,2022-05-06
"First, we have a dual mandate from the Congress: maximum employment and price stability.",2022-05-06
"We said that we would ""aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time"" to ensure that it averages 2 percent over time and that inflation expectations stay anchored.",2022-05-06
"My projection had inflation above 2 percent for 2021 and 2022, with unemployment close to my long-run estimate by the second half of 2022.",2022-05-06
"In April 2021, I said the economy was ""ready to rip,"" and it did.1 I chose to look at the unemployment rate and job creation as the labor market indicators I would use to assess whether we had made ""substantial further progress.""",2022-05-06
My projection was also based on the belief that the jump in inflation that occurred in March 2021 would be more persistent than many expected.,2022-05-06
"With regard to future inflation, 13 participants projected inflation in 2022 would be at or below our 2 percent target.",2022-05-06
"In the March 2021 SEP, no Committee member expected inflation to be over 3 percent for 2021.",2022-05-06
"As I argued in a speech last December, this view was consistent with private-sector economic forecasts.2 When inflation broke loose in March 2021, even though I had expected it to run above 2 percent in 2021 and 2022, I never thought it would reach the very high levels we have seen in recent months.",2022-05-06
"All the suspected drivers of this surge in inflation appeared to be temporary: the one-time stimulus from fiscal policy, supply chain shocks that previous experience indicated would ease soon, and a surge in demand for goods.",2022-05-06
"In addition, we had very accommodative monetary policy that I believed would end in 2022.",2022-05-06
"Over the summer of 2021, the labor market and other data related to economic activity came in as I expected, and so I argued publicly that we were rapidly approaching ""substantial further progress"" on the employment leg of our mandate.",2022-05-06
"Also, unlike the March SEP, every Committee participant now expected inflation to be over 3 percent in 2021 and just five believed inflation would be at 2 percent or below in 2022.",2022-05-06
"In addition, the vast majority of participants now saw risks associated with inflation weighted to the upside.",2022-05-06
"Numerous participants said that new data indicated that tapering should begin sooner than anticipated.3 Thus, in June, after observing high inflation for only three months, the Committee was moving in a hawkish direction and was considering tapering sooner and pulling liftoff forward.",2022-05-06
"At the July FOMC meeting, the minutes show that most participants believed that ""substantial further progress"" had been made on inflation but not employment.4 Tapering was not viewed as imminent by most participants.",2022-05-06
"I considered this a punch in the gut and relevant to a decision on when to start tapering.6 Nevertheless, the September FOMC statement noted that the economy had made progress toward the Committee's goals and that, if progress continued, it would soon be time to taper.7 Up until October, monthly core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation was actually slowing.",2022-05-06
"So, up until the first week of October 2021, the story of high inflation being temporary was holding up, and the labor market improvements had slowed but were continuing.",2022-05-06
"Based on the incoming data, the FOMC announced the start of tapering at its early November meeting.8 It was the October and November consumer price index (CPI) reports that showed that the deceleration of inflation from April to September was short lived and year-over-year inflation had topped 6 percent.",2022-05-06
It became clear that the high inflation realizations were not as temporary as originally thought.,2022-05-06
It was at this pointâ€”with a clearer picture of inflation and revised labor market data in handâ€”that the FOMC pivoted.,2022-05-06
"These forecasts and forward guidance had a significant effect on raising market interest rates, even though we did nothing with our primary policy tool, the federal funds rate, in December 2021.",2022-05-06
"In terms of missing on inflation, policymakers' projections looked very much like most of the public's.",2022-05-06
"For example, as shown in table 1, the median SEP forecast for 2021 Q4/Q4 PCE inflation was very similar to the consensus from the Blue Chip, which is a compilation of private sector forecasts.",2022-05-06
"In short, nearly everyone was behind the curve when it came to forecasting the magnitude and persistence of inflation.",2022-05-06
"Second, as I mentioned, you cannot answer this question without taking a stand on the employment leg of our mandate.",2022-05-06
Many of our critics tend to focus only on the inflation aspect of our mandate and ignore the employment leg of our mandate.,2022-05-06
Two consecutive weak job reports didn't square with a rapidly falling unemployment rate.,2022-05-06
"As shown in table 2, revisions to changes in payroll employment since late last summer have been quite substantial.",2022-05-06
"From the original reports to the current estimate, the change in payroll employment has been revised up nearly 1.5 million.",2022-05-06
"But no one knew, and that's the nature of making monetary policy in real time.",2022-05-06
"My plan is to start with my outlook for the U.S. economy in 2022, and then describe what I consider the appropriate path of monetary policy to keep the economy on a healthy and sustainable course.1 But, before I get into that discussion, let me comment on what I think is on everyone's minds today, Russia's attack on Ukraine.",2022-02-24
"Turning to my outlook for the economy, my greatest concern is continued elevated inflation.",2022-02-24
"Inflation is too high, and I think concerted action is needed to rein it in.",2022-02-24
"The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has multiple tools to tighten monetary policy, and I will go into some detail about how I believe the Fed should approach increasing the target range for the federal funds rate and reducing the size of the balance sheet.",2022-02-24
But let me start with the outlook for economic activity.,2022-02-24
"I expect the economy to continue expanding at a healthy rate this year, slower than in 2021 but still at a solid pace that will keep employment growing strongly.",2022-02-24
"While there are some signs that the effects of the Omicron variant have dampened economic growth in the last month or two, it does not appear to have affected hiring, given the healthy jobs report for January.",2022-02-24
The combination of strong consumer demand and supply constraints has produced very high inflation.,2022-02-24
"The consumer price index (CPI) was up 7.5 percent for the 12 months through January, the highest yearly rate in 40 years.",2022-02-24
"With appropriate monetary policy, and the expected easing in supply constraints, I am hopeful inflation will move down over the course of this year, even with the recent geopolitical developments.",2022-02-24
"Nevertheless, the path of inflation is the biggest risk to my outlook.",2022-02-24
"As we move through this year, I can't emphasize enough how much this outlook, and the appropriate stance of monetary policy, will be influenced by the data that we see about the performance of the economy.",2022-02-24
"With that in hand, I will evaluate the outlook with respect to the Fed's dual mandate in determining the appropriate setting for monetary policy.",2022-02-24
The Labor Market Let's start with where the economy stands with respect to maximum employment.,2022-02-24
I now believe we have achieved the FOMC's objective of maximum employment.,2022-02-24
"These revisions helped explain why we saw such large and steady declines over the year in the unemployment rate, which fell from 6.4 percent in January 2021 to 4 percent in January 2022, which happens to be the median of FOMC participants' December estimates of the longer-run unemployment rate.",2022-02-24
"Accounting for retirees leaving the workforce, I estimate that employment is close to the levels of February 2020, right before the pandemic shock hit the economy and when the target range for the federal funds rate was much higher than the current target range.",2022-02-24
"The January job numbers were just one monthly report, but one reason I have the confidence to declare that maximum employment has been reached is the message January sent about the durability of the continuing recovery.",2022-02-24
"It has been hazardous to predict much about the economic effects of the pandemic more than a month or two out, but I'm comfortable saying we are at maximum employment in part because of the evidence that the labor market is continuing to strengthen.",2022-02-24
"Labor force participation isn't growing as much as one would expect with the hot job market, but apparently it's growing enough to keep the job creation machine humming.",2022-02-24
Another factor that signals we are at maximum employment is the continued rise in measures of labor compensation.,2022-02-24
"The broadest measure of labor compensation, covering wages and benefits, is the employment cost index, which for private sector workers rose at a 4.7 percent annual rate in October, November and December, the fastest pace in 20 years.",2022-02-24
Job vacancies also indicate labor demand is exceptionally strong with nearly 3 million more vacancies than individuals looking for work.,2022-02-24
"Inflation While I will continue to watch data on the labor market, I am focusing most of my attention on inflation, which is far too high and needs to come down.",2022-02-24
"In December, some people were a little surprised to hear me say that inflation was ""alarmingly high,"" but after the latest inflation numbers, I think we all should be alarmed.",2022-02-24
"It is alarming because high inflation is especially painful for lower- and middle-income people, who don't have a choice about paying more for gasoline, groceries, shelter, and other necessities.",2022-02-24
"It is alarming because of the risk that high inflation could become ingrained in people's expectations and prove difficult to rein in, undermining economic growth.",2022-02-24
It was the 11th consecutive month that inflation exceeded 2 percent.,2022-02-24
"The FOMC targets another measure of inflation, the price deflator for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which will be reported tomorrow.",2022-02-24
"But for both measures, inflation has been increasingly broad-based for quite some time.",2022-02-24
"For the CPI, better than 70 percent of items measured are up 3 percent or more in the last 12 months, and for PCE inflation, 60 percent of items were up that much in December.",2022-02-24
"High inflation is a significant problem for individuals and families, and it makes it difficult for businesses to control costs and adjust prices.",2022-02-24
"There is also the risk that the public's expectations of future inflation rise significantly, which affects spending decisions in the short term and thus can have the effect of driving inflation even higher.",2022-02-24
Keeping longer-term inflation expectations anchored is vitally important for monetary policy.,2022-02-24
"In fact, the FOMC's Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy emphasizes that longer-term inflation expectations that are well anchored at 2 percent foster price stability and enhance the Committee's ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances.",2022-02-24
Surveys of consumers' expected inflation over the next year moved up quite notably through 2021 and are currently elevated.,2022-02-24
And the public's expectations of inflation over the next five years have risen as well.,2022-02-24
"That said, five-year inflation expectations are where they were over the past couple of decades when inflation stayed low.",2022-02-24
"For example, future inflation measured by investors trading inflation-adjusted securities has 5-to10-year implied compensation around 2.2 percent, which, adjusted for the FOMC's preferred measure, PCE, is close to 2 percent.",2022-02-24
"In the same way that expectations of much higher inflation can drive a cycle of ever-increasing inflation, when expectations are ""anchored"" and don't move significantly, it can have the effect of helping moderate surges in inflation, such as the one we have seen over the past year.",2022-02-24
"As for what inflation does next, I think anyone who makes a forecast has to own the fact that very few of us foresaw how much inflation would increase in 2021.",2022-02-24
"We underestimated the extent to which supply constraintsâ€”from bottlenecks to labor supply shortagesâ€”and strong demand would drive up inflation, and we thought bottlenecks and shortages would begin to resolve sooner than now.",2022-02-24
"I think we have a clearer idea today of the effect of those factors on inflation but going forward we need see how geopolitical effects influence energy, commodity, and other prices.",2022-02-24
"With some humility, while I am alarmed about the level of inflation and a bit uncertain about how the near-term may play out, I am hopeful that these factors and their price effects are likely to ease in the second half of 2022 and that with appropriate monetary policy, inflation will be coming down significantly by year end.",2022-02-24
"I will be watching closely the data on supply pressures and how those feed into total consumer prices, and I'll be monitoring carefully to see whether expectations rise out of a range that would suggest they are becoming unanchored.",2022-02-24
Appropriate Monetary Policy Now let me spell out what my outlook implies for appropriate monetary policy over the course of 2022.,2022-02-24
"Based on the inflation data in hand, I believe the Fed needs to act promptly to begin tightening monetary policy.",2022-02-24
"As I said earlier, I believe that we have achieved our employment goal and that the labor market will keep improving, which means there should be no delay in responding to inflation that is significantly above our target.",2022-02-24
"The FOMC has already taken actions to end asset purchases in early March, and I believe that the recent inflation and jobs reports have made the case to begin raising the target range for the federal funds rate at our March FOMC meeting.",2022-02-24
"That is, I expect inflation to remain elevated and only show modest signs of deceleration over the next several months.",2022-02-24
"As a result, I believe appropriate interest rate policy brings the target range up to 1 to 1.25 percent early in the summer.",2022-02-24
"That would be a bit below where rates were at the outbreak of the pandemic, when inflation was considerably lower, and before we more than doubled the Fed's balance sheet, so I consider this a necessary and prudent start to tightening policy.",2022-02-24
"But if, for example, tomorrow's PCE inflation report for January, and jobs and CPI reports for February indicate that the economy is still running exceedingly hot, a strong case can be made for a 50-basis-point hike in March.",2022-02-24
"In this state of the world, front-loading a 50-point hike would help convey the Committee's determination to address high inflation, about which there should be no question.",2022-02-24
"With the economy at full employment and inflation far above target, we should signal that we are moving back to neutral at a fast pace based on the performance of the economy, and a 50-basis point hike would help do that.",2022-02-24
"No matter the near-term path of reducing accommodation, the FOMC must respond decisively to the data so as to maintain our credibility that we will bring down inflation.",2022-02-24
"We constantly say we have the tools to fight inflation, and now we must demonstrate the will to use them.",2022-02-24
"If high inflation persists, then I would most likely support that we continue hiking, and potentially increase the pace of tightening.",2022-02-24
"If inflation moderates in the second half of the year, as I expect, and as market participants expect, then we can slow the pace of tightening or even pause.",2022-02-24
"The FOMC has not decided when to begin the reduction in the size of the balance sheet, but we issued a set of principles last month that make it clear that changing the target range of the federal funds rate is our principal monetary policy tool, and that balance sheet reductions through the ""runoff"" from maturing securities would commence after rate hikes have begun.",2022-02-24
The pace of the reduction in asset holdings has not been determined but will be consistent with promoting the FOMC's employment and inflation goals and will be communicated well in advance to the public so that the plan is predictable.,2022-02-24
"Second, the Committee was considering moving to an ample reserves regime for conducting monetary policy, where we wanted to keep the banking system flush with reserves.",2022-02-24
"Third, the economy was in a much different place; in particular inflation was much lower.",2022-02-24
"So even with a hefty reduction in holdings over the next year, we will still have a balance sheet that will be more than sufficiently large enough to conduct monetary policy.",2022-02-24
"Second, the Fed's overnight reverse repurchase agreement facility, put in place to help conduct monetary policy, receives a large amount of deposits each day.",2022-02-24
"Thinking about possible monetary policy actions in 2022, I expect it will be a very fluid year.",2022-02-24
It is interesting to note that these dramatic changes in actual and anticipated monetary policy have occurred without volatility or strain in financial markets.,2022-02-24
I believe the FOMC has been highly effective in communicating its shifting outlook for the economy and appropriate policy actions as the data revealed that inflation was increasing much more than forecasters expected.,2022-02-24
Another point to make about the big changes in actual and anticipated monetary policy is that they are showing up in the financial data today.,2022-02-24
"Although the Fed hasn't started raising rates or reducing the balance sheet, interest rates have moved up notably.",2022-02-24
"In the past couple months, inflation and employment data have been sending the same, unequivocal messageâ€”it is time to start tightening monetary policy.",2022-02-24
I will continue to monitor the geopolitical situation to assess the appropriate timing of this near-term monetary policy tightening.,2022-02-24
"These actions will get us into the second half of the year, when we will have six months of inflation data, and we can assess what the appropriate path will be for the rest of 2022.",2022-02-24
Money also provides a metric for the measurement of prices.,2001-12-05
"That is, once you have defined the unit of exchange, you can measure the price of any other item in terms of that unit.",2001-12-05
Money is also obviously related to monetary policy.,2001-12-05
"Another theme of the lecture is the relationship between the nature of money, the scope for changes in the overall level of prices, and constraints on or opportunities for discretionary monetary policy.",2001-12-05
How would the spread of e-money affect financial stability and the conduct and effectiveness of monetary policy?,2001-12-05
"If so, what becomes of monetary policy, and how would the price level be determined?",2001-12-05
"The warehouses could therefore lend the gold--in turn, often converted into paper notes--holding a reserve of gold that allowed them to meet the normal demands for redemption.",2001-12-05
"Sir Isaac Newton was master of the mint at the time and, according to Eichengreen, set too low a price for silver in terms of gold, inadvertently causing silver coins to mostly disappear from circulation.",2001-12-05
"First, governments attached a high priority to currency and exchange rate stability.",2001-12-05
"Second, central banks had to commit to buy and sell gold at that price.",2001-12-05
"Third, gold could be freely coined, such coins represented a significant part of the money in circulation, and other forms of money were convertible into gold at a fixed price on demand.",2001-12-05
"Most such issues of fiat money were followed by severe increases in prices, as governments tapped to an ever greater degree the easiest--in some cases perhaps the only--source of revenue.",2001-12-05
These experiences highlight the importance of control of the money supply for achieving price stability.,2001-12-05
"Money, Monetary Standards, and Monetary Policy The nature of money determines some important properties of the economy, including the scope for changes in the overall price level and the opportunity for discretionary monetary policy -- that is, for control of the money supply in an effort to improve economic performance.",2001-12-05
"The basic relationship between money and prices is often described in terms of the ""quantity theory of money.""",2001-12-05
"In the long run, according to this proposition, the price level moves proportionately to the money supply.",2001-12-05
"As a result, the rate of inflation depends on the rate of money growth.",2001-12-05
"Though this proposition holds precisely only under restrictive conditions, it identifies in a more general sense an essential link between money and prices.",2001-12-05
"It is therefore useful in understanding the way changes in the nature of money might affect the determination of the price level.5 Under commodity money systems, money is often privately produced, and the price level of non-money goods in terms of the commodity money depends on the supply of commodity money relative to the supplies of the non-money commodities.",2001-12-05
"In a sense, there is no absolute price level of goods in such an economy, only a set of relative prices.",2001-12-05
"However, the relative prices of non-money goods in terms of the commodity money become, in effect, a measure of money prices, as we would think of that term today.",2001-12-05
"Prices of non-money goods in terms of the commodity money need not be constant, but there is no opportunity for discretionary monetary policy.",2001-12-05
"Debasement of the currency typically resulted in inflation--a rise in the price of non-money goods in proportion to the debased currency, which, in effect, maintained the underlying relationship between the commodity, gold or silver, and the price of other goods.",2001-12-05
These are the first experiences with significant inflation induced by government's manipulation of money.,2001-12-05
"As long as the relationship between the commodity money and the amount of paper money backed by the commodity money is stable, inflation will be determined by the available supply of commodity money.",2001-12-05
"But the beginning of modern banking, by breaking the strict link between the commodity money and the money supply, added an element of flexibility to the money supply and further opened up the possibility for inflation.",2001-12-05
"This situation did not guarantee a stable price level, but it did remove the risk of government-induced inflation.",2001-12-05
"The gold standard, in effect, put in place a rule that governed monetary policy.6 If a country ran a trade deficit that exceeded private capital inflows, it would, in principle, finance the difference by shipping gold to other countries.",2001-12-05
"Doing so reduced the money supply--and hence income and prices--in the country with the balance of payments deficit and increased the money supplies, incomes, and prices in the countries with balance of payments surpluses.",2001-12-05
"As a result, the system had a built-in tendency to move the deficit and surplus countries toward balance.",2001-12-05
"The effect on income and prices was, in this case, not due directly to changes in the gold supply, but to the changes in interest rates that were implemented to limit the drain on gold.",2001-12-05
"conveys a sense of automaticity and stability--a self-correcting mechanism with minimum human intervention, which ensures rough stability of prices and balance in international payments.",2001-12-05
"Cooper notes that economic growth during the late nineteenth century was respectable, but variability in income growth was substantially greater under the gold standard than during the period after World War II.7 But the gold standard was predominantly about price stability, so here we might give special weight to evidence pertaining to that characteristic.",2001-12-05
Cooper notes that short-run variations in wholesale prices were greater during the pre-war gold standard than during the period from 1949 to 1979.,2001-12-05
"In assessing economic performance under the gold standard, one must also look at possible trends in prices.",2001-12-05
"If one compares 1877 and 1913, for example, the price level is essentially unchanged.",2001-12-05
But the period covers a sharp and extended decline in the price level followed by an equally sharp and persistent increase.,2001-12-05
"Prices from 1873 to 1896, for example, decreased 53 percent; this decrease was followed by an increase of 56 percent from 1896 to 1913.",2001-12-05
"In the early post-World War II period, nations sought an alternative to the international gold standard to govern exchange rates and international economic relations.",2001-12-05
"At a conference at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in 1944, participating governments agreed to maintain a fixed exchange rate system--more precisely, an adjustable peg.",2001-12-05
"Exchange rates were mostly stable but could be altered in discrete amounts, under prescribed circumstances--allowing deviation from a fully rules-based system to one with more discretion.",2001-12-05
"In practice, the system was implemented by the commitment of the United States to maintain a fixed relation between its currency and gold and other countries' agreement to fix their exchange rates relative to the dollar, at rates agreed to at the conference.",2001-12-05
Fixed exchange rate systems provide a degree of constraint on domestic monetary policies.,2001-12-05
"Most countries, given limits on their international reserves, had to follow policies consistent with supporting their fixed exchange rates--though, as noted above, they had the option of changing the exchange rate.",2001-12-05
"As long as the United States was prepared to convert dollars into gold, at a fixed exchange rate for official purposes, other countries seemed willing to hold dollars.",2001-12-05
"When the United States broke the link to gold in 1971, other major countries no longer were willing to accept dollars at the fixed exchange rate.",2001-12-05
"The adjustable peg system broke down, and the world ended up, de facto, in a regime of floating exchange rates, with exchange rates determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market.",2001-12-05
The combination of fiat money systems and floating exchange rates removed the earlier constraints on domestic monetary policies for other countries and made price stability and other dimensions of domestic economic performance dependent on the conduct of their domestic monetary policies.,2001-12-05
"Central banks had to learn how to exercise that discretion in support of the objectives usually dictated by their legislatures, almost always including price stability and, in the case of the United States, price stability and full employment.8 There have been disappointments as well as successes with monetary policy around the world.",2001-12-05
"Over time, the number of independent central banks has increased significantly, and independence no doubt enhances the ability of central banks to achieve price stability.",2001-12-05
"There has also been an advance in our understanding of how to conduct monetary policy to achieve stable rates of inflation, at least on average over a period of years, and perhaps also to contribute, at the same time, to smoothing output and employment growth.",2001-12-05
"Over the last ten to fifteen years, coinciding with both an increased emphasis on the price stability objective and the advances in our understanding about the conduct of policy, inflation performance has been very good.",2001-12-05
"However, some countries today continue to impose constraints on discretionary monetary policy through fixed exchange rate regimes, tying their inflation rates to inflation in the country to which their exchange rate is pegged.",2001-12-05
"This system does not eliminate the influence of discretion, but it makes inflation in one country dependent on the discretionary monetary policy in some other country.",2001-12-05
"A currency board and dollarization are tighter versions of a fixed exchange rate regime--that is, fixed exchange rate systems from which it is progressively more costly to exit.",2001-12-05
"E-money and Financial Stability The spread of e-money could have significant implications for the size of central bank balance sheets, for depository institutions (depending on which are allowed to provide network money), for financial stability, and possibly for the implementation of monetary policy.",2001-12-05
"E-money and Monetary Policy To appreciate the implications of the spread of e-money for monetary policy, it will be helpful to understand the concept of the monetary base (B).",2001-12-05
Monetary policy is implemented through the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) setting a target for the federal funds rate.,2001-12-05
The federal funds rate is determined by the supply and demand for such reserves.,2001-12-05
"The implications of the spread of e-money for monetary policy would arise from the substitution of e-money for both currency and deposits, shrinking the size of the monetary base.",2001-12-05
"Taken by itself, the decline in the demand for currency would have no direct implications for the conduct of monetary policy because what matters for monetary policy is the supply of and demand for reserves.11 A decline in the demand for currency would, however, lower the monetary base and hence reduce the size of the Fed's portfolio of securities.",2001-12-05
"To the extent that the demand for currency declines, the monetary base and hence the Fed's portfolio would shrink, and the interest earnings on that portfolio would diminish.",2001-12-05
"The Fed uses the interest earnings, along with revenue from fees for check clearing, Fedwire, and other priced services, to cover the cost of its operations.",2001-12-05
More interesting is the possibility that the spread of network e-money might dramatically reduce the demand for deposits and hence correspondingly reduce the amount of bank reserves.,2001-12-05
"In that case, the spread of e-money would not significantly reduce the effectiveness of monetary policy.",2001-12-05
"In this case, reserves would decline, so we would need to analyze the implications of such a decline for the conduct of monetary policy.",2001-12-05
"Fortunately, we already have some experience with earlier innovations that have reduced the demand for reserves.",2001-12-05
The Fed has worried that this decline in the level of required reserve balances could result in increased volatility of the funds rate and require the Fed to alter the way it conducts monetary policy.,2001-12-05
"But without the cushion provided by required reserves, the intraday and interday fluctuations in the demand for reserves could increase the volatility of the federal funds rate.",2001-12-05
"In the absence of such new statutory authority, the Fed has indicated it might need to alter the way it implements monetary policy, in the event that required reserve balances fell further and the volatility of the funds rate increased.",2001-12-05
The same system could be implemented if the spread of e-money reduced the demand for transactions balances and hence the level of required reserves.,2001-12-05
"Such a system is common, indeed almost the norm for other central banks, in the conduct of monetary policy.",2001-12-05
"Several countries have eliminated required reserves, and we appreciate today that reserve requirements are not essential for the conduct of monetary policy.14 In any case, under these assumptions, there would be no demand for required reserve balances at the central bank.",2001-12-05
"Nevertheless, if trust in e-money instruments were not complete, holders would presumably demand that e-money be exchangeable for notes and coin at par.",2001-12-05
"In this case, there may be no problem for monetary policy.",2001-12-05
"The resulting demand for the monetary base would allow the Fed to set the federal funds rate (by setting the supply of reserves, or by setting the terms on deposit and borrowing facilities).",2001-12-05
"If trust in the private provider or providers were complete, and nobody ever doubted their ability to convert stored-value or network money into dollars, then demand for the monetary base could fall to zero.",2001-12-05
But providers of stored-value cards and network money would still need funds to meet demands as holders of the e-money use it to buy goods and services.,2001-12-05
"In this case, once again, there does not appear to be a problem for monetary policy.",2001-12-05
"This hypothetical situation--perhaps one more interesting as an intellectual challenge than as a plausible outcome--forces us to try to understand what the minimum requirements are for an effective monetary policy, defined as one that can maintain control of some short-term interest rate.",2001-12-05
He convincingly argues that monetary policy could still maintain control over interest rates--provided that the central bank can pay interest on the deposit balances it offers.,2001-12-05
The central bank can conduct monetary policy in this case by setting an interest rate on balances held at the central bank.,2001-12-05

Woodford does not address the possibility that banks might not have a positive demand for central bank balances.,2001-12-05
"Even in this case, the availability of central bank balances and credit at an interest rate set by the central bank would, in my view, effectively control the interest rate on interbank deposits and therefore continue to allow the central bank to conduct monetary policy.",2001-12-05

It is not clear that a private monopoly central bank has the incentives to produce good monetary policy.,2001-12-05
"Indeed, given the externalities involved, it seems plausible that a monopoly central bank that issued fiat money would not respond optimally to crises (it would charge too much for liquidity) or to cyclical variations (it would be maximizing the present discounted value of its seigniorage income rather than minimizing some weighted sum of discounted inflation and output losses).",2001-12-05

"Finally, although one can find economic circumstances in which inflation targeting will work well, it is also possible to imagine circumstances in which even forward-looking, flexible inflation targeting may not work so well, some of these circumstances from the fairly recent past of the United States.",2000-01-13
Basic Aspects of Inflation Targeting Describing an inflation-targeting regime is straightforward.,2000-01-13
"A country or its central bank commits to controlling inflation, with an explicit target rate and usually a tolerance band around this target rate.",2000-01-13
"Obvious price shocks such as indirect taxes, commodity prices, or interest rates themselves are usually excluded in the calculation of inflation targets.",2000-01-13
"Many inflation-targeting regimes permit flexibility for pursuing other goals, such as output stabilization, though the primary commitment of the central bank is clearly to control inflation.",2000-01-13
"Given the lags in monetary policy, many regimes also are forward-looking, in the sense that the central bank operates not against current inflation but expected inflation in the near future.",2000-01-13
"Three rationales normally are given for the adoption of inflation-targeting regimes: The provision of a nominal anchor for policy, transparency, and credibility.",2000-01-13
A nominal anchor may be required if countries permit their exchange rates to vary and if they do not target either the growth of monetary quantities or nominal income.,2000-01-13
"Governments or their central banks may need such an anchor to stabilize inflation, and they can generate the anchor by announcing an inflation target and then doing what they must do to hit that target.",2000-01-13
"To the extent that monetary authorities can hit their target, central banks would also gain credibility, which many need after years of inflation.",2000-01-13
It is commonly argued that inflationary expectations are a key aspect of the inflation process.,2000-01-13
"In lowering inflationary expectations, inflation targeting can itself help reduce inflationary pressures.",2000-01-13
One can also rationalize inflation targeting through another form of economic reasoning.,2000-01-13
"Some years ago many believed, along with Milton Friedman, that stabilizing the growth of the money supply would lead to stable prices.",2000-01-13
But this approach is now generally discredited because shocks in the demand for money and an unstable transmission mechanism imply that stable growth of monetary aggregates could lead to quite unstable behavior for prices and real incomes.,2000-01-13
The next step was to follow Bennett McCallum (1988) and avoid inappropriate responses to shocks in the demand for money by having the central bank simply stabilize nominal income growth.,2000-01-13
"But again, if there were shocks in this nominal income growth, say productivity shocks, stabilizing nominal income growth would not necessarily stabilize prices.",2000-01-13
"The same productivity shocks have led to difficulties with the instrument rule proposed by John Taylor (1993), which requires either a predictable rate of growth of potential output or a predictable natural rate of unemployment.",2000-01-13
"As these other procedures for conducting monetary policy have run into difficulty, academic economists have increasingly drifted to the straightforward view of Bernanke, Laubach, Mishkin, Posen and many others that, if central banks want to stabilize prices, they should just do that by inflation targeting.",2000-01-13
But the migration of academic economists to inflation targeting is nothing compared with the migration of actual real world countries to inflation targeting.,2000-01-13
"The earliest and still most elaborate procedures were adopted by New Zealand, where the parliamentary government in 1990 began negotiating inflation targets with its newly independent central bank, making these targets public, and holding the bank responsible for hitting the targets.",2000-01-13
"Other regimes came later and were less elaborate, but by now a great many countries have regimes in which they publish inflation targets, have the central bank commit to meeting these targets, and comment on the progress in meeting the targets.",2000-01-13
"Because all central banks in the world are responsible for controlling inflation, it is reasonable to ask how explicit inflation-targeting regimes differ from non-targeting regimes.",2000-01-13
"Inflation-targeting regimes have explicit inflation targets, explicit commitments of the central bank to meet these targets, and less formal commitments to achieve other goals, such as output stabilization.",2000-01-13
"On one side, even non-targeting countries often will be strongly committed to controlling inflation.",2000-01-13
"On the other side, countries that target inflation flexibly and in a forward-looking manner may also strive to reduce output variability, perhaps because it helps to stabilize future inflation.",2000-01-13
"All existing inflation targets around the world are for low, positive rates of inflation.",2000-01-13
"For developed countries with stable inflation rates, the world average target rate of inflation is around 2 percent, with an acceptable band that normally ranges from 1 to 3 percent.",2000-01-13
"Target levels are higher, but are promised to be stepped down gradually over time, for emerging-market countries that are trying to bring inflation down from very high levels.",2000-01-13
There is academic interest in targeting future price levels as opposed to inflation rates.,2000-01-13
The two approaches differ mainly in their response to past errors: Is the central bank to be held responsible for offsetting these past errors and getting the price level back on track or just for stabilizing inflation from this time forward?,2000-01-13
"King (1999) shows that, if a long enough interval is given to hit the target, there may be little difference between a price level target and an inflation rate target.",2000-01-13
"In any event, no country now targets the future price level.",2000-01-13
"However, there could be an important difference between a target of a low positive rate of inflation and one of a zero rate of inflation.",2000-01-13
"Many potential inflation targeters ask, ""Why not zero?""",2000-01-13
There are three reasons for targeting for an inflation rate above zero.,2000-01-13
"Try as they might, most countries do have some bias in their price indexes.",2000-01-13
But there may still be some irreducible upward bias in measuring inflation.,2000-01-13
The second reason for shooting at a rate of inflation slightly above zero is known as the zero bound problem.,2000-01-13
"If a country's real interest rates are close to zero and its inflation rate is close to zero, its nominal interest rates will also be close to zero.",2000-01-13
"Since costs of holding cash are minimal, a central bank cannot push nominal interest rates much below zero.",2000-01-13
This means that countries that target for zero inflation could get in the bind of being unable to ease monetary policy in response to recessionary shocks.,2000-01-13
"This forms a strong rationale for avoiding the danger in the first place, which can be helped by targeting for a low positive rate of inflation.",2000-01-13
The third reason for targeting a low positive rate of inflation is labor market inefficiencies.,2000-01-13
"Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry (1996) argue that these can be lessened with some positive inflation.",2000-01-13
"Essentially, employers can be spared the necessity of cutting workers' nominal wage when these workers' productivity falls below their real wage.",2000-01-13
"While Akerlof, Dickens, and Perry make an empirical case for their views, others find little evidence that labor markets become less efficient when inflation drops to very low levels.",2000-01-13
"While economists are still debating these issues, from a pragmatic standpoint many countries do seem to be gravitating toward a consensus on how inflation targeting should work.",2000-01-13
"All inflation-targeting developed countries target a low positive rate, and emerging-market countries aspire to this kind of target.",2000-01-13
Most countries target inflation in a flexible and forward-looking manner.,2000-01-13
"Theoretical Pros and Cons From a theoretical perspective, one might think that inflation targets would be most valuable to countries with a history of bad inflation.",2000-01-13
One is to peg their exchange rate to some hard currency and essentially tie the hands of their central bank.,2000-01-13
The second route is to adopt an inflation target and to stick to it.,2000-01-13
"If the prior inflation is very bad, as it often is in emerging-market countries, these targets might have to start at a high level and be worked gradually down as the central bank brings inflation under control.",2000-01-13
"Although inflation targeting is usually described as an antidote to past inflationary binges, it has also been suggested as a cure to potential deflation.",2000-01-13
"Krugman (1998), for example, has argued that Japan, with nominal interest rates stuck at their floor of zero, can lower real interest rates and stimulate investment by having the Bank of Japan target a positive rate of inflation and do what it can to hit that target.",2000-01-13
Inflation-targeting regimes might also work well when a country undergoes what is known as a productivity shock.,2000-01-13
"Suppose a wave of innovations makes productivity rise, pushing up output and lowering unit labor costs.",2000-01-13
"For a time this shock might be reflected in higher-than-trend rates of growth of output and lower-than-trend rates of unemployment, making it difficult to rely on normal indicators of demand and supply growth in the conduct of monetary policy.",2000-01-13
"In such circumstances, a cautious central bank might well just wait for signs of inflation to emerge, thwart the inflation if it occurs, and not rely as heavily on normal measures of aggregate demand growth or labor market tightness.",2000-01-13
"Such a central bank would, in effect, be following an inflation-targeting regime.",2000-01-13
"Although liberals in general have been very critical of inflation targeting (Galbraith, 1999), in this case inflation targeting would lead to exactly the type of monetary policy they would favor.",2000-01-13
"But in some cases, inflation targeting might not work out so well.",2000-01-13
Suppose there were a recessionary shock to aggregate demand.,2000-01-13
"Because inflation normally responds slowly to such shocks, inflation targeters could respond in any of three ways.",2000-01-13
"Strict inflation targeters, sometimes snidely called inflation nutters, might sit idly by and let the recession happen.",2000-01-13
"Or, if inflation fell below target ranges, some central banks might take steps to boost inflation by expansionary monetary policy.",2000-01-13
"They would clearly do this if deflation threatened, but they might do it even with low positive rates of inflation below target ranges.",2000-01-13
The third possible response involves flexible and forward-looking inflation targeting as is actually practiced in most countries.,2000-01-13
"Because inflation usually responds slowly to output changes in recessions, flexible inflation-targeting regimes would be free to ease policy to stabilize output, much as would non-targeting central banks.",2000-01-13
Forward-looking central banks could even act affirmatively against recessions to prevent future inflation from falling below its target range.,2000-01-13
But even here the flexibility to be forward-looking and to pursue other goals is less than a commitment of the central bank to try to stabilize output or promote full employment.,2000-01-13
"The exact importance of these other objectives remains in question, even for flexible and forward-looking inflation-targeting regimes.",2000-01-13
"Other instances in which inflation targeting might not work so well are negative supply shocks, such as most economies experienced in the mid-1970s when oil prices exploded.",2000-01-13
"In these times, inflation rises just as output falls.",2000-01-13
The most flexible and competent central bank in the world would be faced with a difficult dilemma in such circumstances--forestall the recession by making inflation worse or limit the inflation by making the recession worse.,2000-01-13
"In general, an inflation-targeting central bank would not have much of a choice.",2000-01-13
"It would be forced to try to limit the inflation by contractionary policies, hence making the recession worse.",2000-01-13
"Even a flexible, forward-looking inflation-targeting central bank would not have much freedom in such a situation, because in the end the central bank would be evaluated much more on its success in meeting inflation targets than in meeting output growth targets.",2000-01-13
"Hence, inflation targeting does not appear to solve all the problems central banks might face and cannot be prescribed as a panacea.",2000-01-13
"It still might be a reasonable policy strategy for most purposes, and it still seems to be generally the proper approach for dealing with histories of inflation or deflation and, perhaps, with productivity shocks.",2000-01-13
"Actual Experience Theoretical arguments aside, many countries have used inflation targeting for most of the 1990s.",2000-01-13
Hence we can do more than theorize: We can actually look at the inflation-targeting experience in several countries and see how it has worked out.,2000-01-13
"They have compared a country's post-inflation-targeting history with its pre-inflation-targeting history, and they have compared outcomes in inflation-targeting countries with those in non-targeting countries.",2000-01-13
"The time series studies have focused mainly on the three countries that have had the longest experience with inflation targeting--New Zealand (adopted in 1990), Canada (1991), and the United Kingdom (1992).",2000-01-13
"According to the simple numbers, once these countries adopted inflation targeting, actual inflation has fallen in each country, and nominal interest rates have fallen, suggesting lower inflation expectations.",2000-01-13
"Real measures, such as the growth in output or unemployment, have either shown little change or worsened only slightly.",2000-01-13
"Generally, unemployment rose as a country disinflated and then returned to its former average level, but sometimes not all the way there.",2000-01-13
"Ammer and Freeman (1995) estimated VAR models for real GDP, price levels, and real interest rates up to the adoption of a targeting regime and then simulated these models into the targeting era, comparing simulated values with actual values.",2000-01-13
They found that inflation fell below predictions in all three countries.,2000-01-13
A subsequent analysis by Freeman and Willis (1995) focused more intensely on interest rates.,2000-01-13
The authors noted that long-term nominal rates fell in all three countries following the adoption of inflation targeting but then came back up in the mid-1990s.,2000-01-13
The latter rises could either indicate that inflation-targeting regimes became less credible or simply reflect the fact that world interest rates were rising at this time.,2000-01-13
"Freeman and Willis worked out a model to disentangle the two effects and put most of the explanation for rising long-term nominal rates on the behavior of world interest rates, hence suggesting that inflation-targeting regimes remained credible.",2000-01-13
Mishkin and Posen (1997) noted that all three inflation-targeting countries reduced inflation before adopting a formal targeting regime.,2000-01-13
"The achievement of inflation targeting, then, was to lock in the gains of earlier fights to stabilize prices.",2000-01-13
"The authors also estimated VAR equations up to the adoption of inflation targeting and simulated these equations into the targeting period, now for six years.",2000-01-13
"Just as in the earlier analysis of Ammer and Freeman, this analysis suggested that in all three countries the inflation targeting led to a drop in inflation and nominal interest rates.",2000-01-13
"In Canada, the rate of growth of real GDP was down slightly; in the other two countries, there was no change in the rate of growth of real GDP.",2000-01-13
"Despite the fact that inflation had dropped in all three countries before the adoption of inflation targeting, these authors observed upward inflationary blips in New Zealand and Canada; so perhaps the achievement of keeping inflation under control should not be taken for granted.",2000-01-13
"Their results were buttressed by those of Kuttner and Posen (1999), whose VAR regressions for the United Kingdom found that inflation persistence was reduced by inflation targeting, as measured by inflation itself and by nominal interest rates.",2000-01-13
"In Canada, there was no inflation persistence before or after inflation targeting as measured by inflation rates, though again targeting reduced inflation persistence as measured by nominal interest rates.",2000-01-13
"In New Zealand, the results were the opposite--targeting reduced persistence as measured by inflation rates but seemed to increase it slightly as measured by nominal interest rates.",2000-01-13
"They noted that the decade of the 1990s, when many countries went to inflation targeting, was a good one for economic outcomes: Many monetary regimes tried in this decade are likely to look good.",2000-01-13
"In their formal work, these authors fit VAR models for twenty-three countries, nine inflation targeters and fourteen non-targeters.",2000-01-13
"From these models, they deduced policymakers' aversion to inflation volatility.",2000-01-13
They found that inflation aversion rose in countries that adopted inflation targeting but only to the level of aversion already apparent in the policies of the non-targeting countries.,2000-01-13
"At this point, there is very little difference between aversion to inflation in countries that target and countries that do not target inflation.",2000-01-13
"Taken together, the basic data, the time series tests, and the cross-section tests indicate that inflation targeting has seemed to succeed.",2000-01-13
"Inflation has dropped materially in the three countries with the longest experience with the regime, and all inflation-targeting countries are still content with inflation targeting, in some cases eight to ten years after its adoption.",2000-01-13
Measures of inflation persistence also have dropped.,2000-01-13
"A seeming weakness of inflation targeting is in its response to unemployment, but at this time one can find little evidence that unemployment has worsened in targeting countries.",2000-01-13
"At the same time, inflation targeting has been adopted in the 1990s, a good decade for economic outcomes in most countries.",2000-01-13
It is unclear how inflation targeting would look in more difficult economic circumstances such as the 1970s.,2000-01-13
Is Inflation Targeting Right for the United States?,2000-01-13
"The hidden question in all this, of course, is whether the United States should go to a regime of explicit inflation targeting.",2000-01-13
"First, the question of whether the United States does or does not adopt a formal inflation targeting regime is not up to the Federal Reserve.",2000-01-13
"The Federal Reserve Act now requires the Fed to strive for maximum employment and balanced growth, along with price stability and moderate long-term interest rates.",2000-01-13
"Second, the Federal Reserve is strongly committed to controlling inflation, however formally this goal is specified in the Fed's mandate.",2000-01-13
Countless official pronouncements and testimony affirm the importance of controlling inflation.,2000-01-13
"As for actions, at least Cecchetti and Ehrmann find that the Fed's revealed inflation aversion is now as high as that of the formal inflation-targeting countries.",2000-01-13
"Given this strong inflation aversion, ultimately there may be little difference between informal inflation targeting as practiced in the United States and flexible, forward-looking inflation targeting as practiced in many other countries around the world.",2000-01-13
"That said, one could still ask the normative question of whether the United States should go to what I will call a more formal system of inflation targeting.",2000-01-13
"Even if the present-day pragmatic Fed responds to exogenous rises in the growth of aggregate supply or drops in the non-inflationary rate of unemployment in a fully accommodative manner, inflation targeting may better communicate the strategy.",2000-01-13
"For example, explicit inflation-targeting statements may help to make it clear that the Fed is really fighting inflation, not economic growth.",2000-01-13
"Economic circumstances have been good in the 1990s, when countries have gone over to inflation targeting, and it is worth repeating that inflation targeting is no panacea.",2000-01-13
"Moreover, there is a potential problem with inflation targeting even in good economic times.",2000-01-13
"If forecasting inflation is difficult, even forward-looking inflation-targeting central banks may respond to inflationary shocks too late to ward off inflation.",2000-01-13
"Although there are several ways to forecast inflation, none may be that reliable.",2000-01-13
"On the other side, one could imagine constructing leading indicators of inflation, but the experience until now is that not many of these are reliable either.",2000-01-13
"One could also rely on market expectations of inflation, survey evidence, or other forecasts of inflation.",2000-01-13
"Without models or leading indicators, even forward-looking inflation targeting strategies may not work as well as advertised.",2000-01-13
Conclusion Inflation targeting has many things going for it.,2000-01-13
"This strategy of conducting monetary policy has been widely adopted around the world, and it has seemed to be successful in lowering inflation and perceptions of future inflation.",2000-01-13
"It has a potential drawback in ignoring explicit consideration of output gaps and unemployment, but perhaps because it has been applied flexibly and in a forward-looking manner, in fact it has not seemed to generate more unemployment than other monetary regimes would have.",2000-01-13
"For the United States, given the strong aversion to inflation already apparent in policy responses, there are various pros and cons, but it is not obvious that a more formal regime of inflation targeting will lead to very great differences in actual monetary policies.",2000-01-13

Sustaining the high performance of the economy depends much more on what people in Minnesota do--along with those in Maine and Louisiana and Oregon--than it does on monetary policy.,1999-05-13
"The statistics usually cited are the growth rate of gross national product, the unemployment rate and the rate of inflation (for which there exist several different measures).",1999-05-13

"Millions of new jobs have been created in the last few years; and unemployment, now at 4.3 percent, has been at or below 5 percent for over two years.",1999-05-13
"Not long ago, most economists thought growth this rapid and unemployment this low would inevitably produce inflation.",1999-05-13
"However, inflation has remained remarkably subdued, and, indeed has continued to decline over the last several years.",1999-05-13
"A few areas with deep-seated economic problems, such as Northern Minnesota, still lag, and parts of agriculture are suffering severely from the downward pressure of weak world demand on commodity prices, but growth in other sectors has taken up much of the slack.",1999-05-13
"Low inflation has reduced expectations of inflation, lowered long-term interest rates, encouraged investment and housing and made planning ahead easier for everyone.",1999-05-13
"Perhaps most important, strong growth and tight labor markets have opened opportunities for workers at all levels--opportunities to move up, to get better jobs, to get off welfare, to go back to school with less fear of being unable to find jobs on completion.",1999-05-13
"And it isn't just the United States that benefits from our prosperity--indeed, the vibrant American economy is contributing mightily to the revival of growth in what would otherwise be a weak global economy.",1999-05-13
"Much of Latin America is in recession as a result of the Brazilian financial crisis and low commodity prices; Russia is struggling and exporting its troubles to its trading partners; even Western Europe, affected by all of the above, is growing far more slowly than we are.",1999-05-13
"A slowdown in the U.S. economy would reduce our trade and current account deficits, but make it harder for the rest of the world to recover.",1999-05-13
"The key conundrum is how we have managed to have such strong growth and associated tight labor markets, with subdued, even declining, inflation.",1999-05-13
"The world financial crisis has weakened demand for internationally traded goods, especially commodities, including agricultural products, metals, and oil (although the oil price has come back up recently as producing countries cut supply).",1999-05-13
"In the face of weak demand, world prices of just about everything tradable are low and competition is fierce.",1999-05-13
The strong dollar has made imports cheap and has helped keep inflation low-to the benefit of U.S. consumers and the distress of some U.S. producers.,1999-05-13
"We can't count on low world commodity prices or a strong dollar continuing far into the future, and both have their downsides for us and for others.",1999-05-13
"The events of the last two years come on top of a huge expansion of global trade, competition and productive capacity--all of which have given American businesses less control over prices in the face of rising costs and benefited American consumers through low prices.",1999-05-13

The increasing competitiveness of the U.S. economy--and that of the rest of the world--seems likely to continue to reduce inflationary tendencies in the future.,1999-05-13
"Conversely, reregulation or a relapse into protectionism would tend to negate the procompetitive and anti-inflationary trend.",1999-05-13
"It demands flexibility and adaptability of businesses, workers and communities.",1999-05-13
"Strong growth and tight labor markets reduce the likely cost of taking chances for workers, businesses and communities.",1999-05-13
But change is hard and not everyone is willing or able to pay the price.,1999-05-13
One of the determinants of how long the U.S. economy can continue to perform at a high level with low inflation is how well we all learn to adapt to the changes that go with the increased competitiveness of the national and international marketplace that is helping to keep our economy growing and inflation low.,1999-05-13
An important part of the answer to why the U.S. economy has been able to grow so strongly without inflation accelerating has been the recent resurgence in productivity growth.,1999-05-13
"Productivity grew strongly from the end of World War II into the early 1970s, accounting for the rapid increase in American's real incomes over that period.",1999-05-13
"Then, around the time of the first oil shock in the early 1970s, productivity growth slowed drastically both here and in other industrial countries, remaining weak in the U.S. through the 1980s and first half of the 1990s.",1999-05-13
Average growth in output per hour in non-farm business was only a little over 1 percent between 1973 and 1995.,1999-05-13
"In the last three years, however, productivity growth has accelerated, reaching an astonishing 4 percent growth in the last two quarters.",1999-05-13
The growth in productivity has enabled business to pay higher wages without raising prices significantly or eroding profits severely.,1999-05-13
"Is the increase in productivity a temporary cyclical response to strong growth or does it presage an upward shift in the productivity growth trend that will make it easier going forward to continue strong growth, rising real incomes and low inflation?",1999-05-13
Hypotheses abound about why productivity growth might have accelerated in the mid 1990s.,1999-05-13
"Although the telecommunications and information management revolution did not start in the 1990s, it may have been just at the right point by then to offer firms that are facing strong demand and tight labor markets a way to increase their efficiency.",1999-05-13
"In the past, when unemployment remained low for an extended period, economists expected productivity to suffer because firms were forced to hire less skilled workers with less experience--workers whose productivity was likely to be low.",1999-05-13
"However, recent experience suggests--but certainly does not yet prove--that two factors may have combined to change the expected impact of tight labor markets on productivity.",1999-05-13
A whole generation of managers has been trained to think continuously about productivity and quality management.,1999-05-13
All of these have combined to increase productivity.,1999-05-13
Companies can keep their focus on cutting costs and increasing productivity; they can foster research and innovation; they can offer training and employee incentives to acquire more education and skills.,1999-05-13
"This kind of behavior will result in government adding to the national saving rate and enhancing the chances of future growth, rather than subtracting from national saving by running public deficits.",1999-05-13
"Finally, the Federal Reserve can continue trying, as we have been doing, to balance the risk of allowing the economy to grow too fast for its own long-run good and begin a growth-threatening acceleration of inflation against the other risk that the economy will slowdown too much in the near term and lose the benefits of healthy labor markets and sustainable growth.",1999-05-13
"Indeed, the special nature of the savings and loan--originating and holding long-term assets financed with short-term liabilities--could flourish only in a noninflationary environment, where interest rates were low and stable and where the yield curve rarely varied from its traditional upward slope.",1999-11-02
"But as inflationary forces began to surface, market pressures on the conventional thrift model began to build.",1999-11-02
The need to adjust average asset maturities in the face of rising interest rates spurred development and expansion of a secondary mortgage market.,1999-11-02
"This was also an era when the principal mortgage lenders, savings and loans, were sometimes constrained from satisfying mortgage demands by binding Regulation Q ceilings that eroded their deposit base when interest rates rose.",1999-11-02
"To repeat, the 1990s have generally been a time of robust growth for the mortgage markets.",1999-11-02
"Moreover, owing to the simple arithmetic of our population growth, it is almost certain to become increasingly dedicated to existing home purchases and refinancing in the 21st century.",1999-11-02
"The reason, of course, is that existing home sales reflect the turnover of the existing housing stock that, in turn, parallels the level of the population or, more directly, the number of households, while sales of new homes, more or less, are driven by the growth in population or, still more closely, household formation.",1999-11-02
"Short of a significant acceleration in immigration or a remarkable surge in the birthrate, few demographers would project a continuing rise in the rate of population growth to match the inexorable rise in the level of population.",1999-11-02
"Newly constructed homes, however, are tied to growth in the number of households.",1999-11-02
"In the future, that growth is likely to be flat at best, with very little upside potential.",1999-11-02
"Sales of existing homes, of course, reflecting the growth in population, averaged about 4 million during the 1990s, compared with a much smaller number--2.8 million-- during the 1970s.",1999-11-02
"This trend has important implications for economic activity beyond its impact on housebuilding, because the sale of a newly constructed home does not generate capital gains financed through the mortgage market.",1999-11-02
"Sales of existing homes almost always do, and the purchasing power released through converting home equity to unencumbered cash can affect overall consumer demand and the economy, just as the stock market gains of recent years have boosted consumption.",1999-11-02
Estimates by the staff of the Federal Reserve indicate that about 40 percent of the growth in outstanding home mortgage debt during the past five years originated as financing the extraction of home equity.,1999-11-02
The average nine-year period of ownership brings a substantial increase in market values even when the average annual increase in home prices has been modest.,1999-11-02
"Obviously, were home prices to fall for a protracted period, no capital gains would be available to extract.",1999-11-02
"We estimate that, over the past five years, the average capital gain on the sale of an existing home net of transaction costs was more than $25,000, almost a fifth of the average purchase price, and roughly equal to the equity extraction financed by debt.",1999-11-02
Presumably even normal amortized equity that did not come from higher home prices was extracted in this manner.,1999-11-02
"Although, as I indicated in an earlier speech on this subject, the appreciation of stock prices has been vastly greater than that of home prices, most estimates suggest that stock market gains are consumed only gradually, with the level of consumer outlays lifted permanently by around 3 to 4 percent of the wealth generated by the stock market gain.",1999-11-02
"The major reason for these significant differences in spending out of household wealth is doubtless that, while home prices do on occasion decline, large declines are rare; the general experience of homeowners is a modest, but persistent, rise in home values that is perceived to be largely permanent.",1999-11-02
"Stock prices and existing home sales are somewhat correlated, a not altogether unexpected result, because each is affected by interest rates and presumably the gains from each help finance the other.",1999-11-02
This correlation makes it difficult to disentangle gains in overall consumer spending that are attributable to home equity extractions and to increases in stock prices.,1999-11-02
"The recent rise in the homeownership rate to over 67 percent in the third quarter of this year owes, in part, to the healthy economic expansion with its robust job growth.",1999-11-02
Today I would like to step back a bit from current policy concerns to address the broader topic of the logical framework within which monetary policy is made.,2004-12-02
"1 Car and Driver: A Misleading Analogy Eight times each year the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets to set U.S. monetary policy--which, under current operating procedures, amounts to choosing a target for the federal funds rate, a short-term interest rate that the Federal Reserve influences by controlling the supply of bank reserves.",2004-12-02
"A commonly used analogy takes the U.S. economy to be an automobile, the FOMC to be the driver, and monetary policy actions to be taps on the accelerator or brake.",2004-12-02
"According to this analogy, when the economy is running too slowly (say, unemployment is high and growth is below its potential rate), the FOMC increases pressure on the accelerator by lowering its target for the federal funds rate, thereby stimulating aggregate spending and economic activity.",2004-12-02
"When the economy is running too quickly (say, inflation appears likely to rise), the FOMC switches to the brake by raising its funds rate target, thereby depressing spending and cooling the economy.",2004-12-02
"Unfortunately, the simplistic view of monetary policymaking derived from the automobile analogy can be seriously misleading, for at least two reasons.",2004-12-02
"Despite the best efforts of the statistical agencies and other data collectors, economic data provide incomplete coverage of economic activity, are subject to substantial sampling error, and become available only with a lag.",2004-12-02
"In short, if making monetary policy is like driving a car, then the car is one that has an unreliable speedometer, a foggy windshield, and a tendency to respond unpredictably and with a delay to the accelerator or the brake.",2004-12-02
The second problem with the automobile analogy arises from the central role of private-sector expectations in determining the impact of monetary policy actions.,2004-12-02
"The current funds rate imperfectly measures policy stimulus because the most important economic decisions, such as a family's decision to buy a new home or a firm's decision to acquire new capital goods, depend much more on longer-term interest rates, such as mortgage rates and corporate bond rates, than on the federal funds rate.",2004-12-02
"Monetary policy makers can affect private-sector expectations through their actions and statements, but the need to think about such things significantly complicates the policymakers' task (Bernanke, 2004).",2004-12-02
I hope that this short discussion convinces you that making effective monetary policy is no Sunday drive in the park.,2004-12-02
"With both the informational limitations facing policymakers and the role of private-sector expectations in mind, I turn next to a discussion of two alternative frameworks for thinking about monetary policy.",2004-12-02
"Making Monetary Policy: Two Candidate Frameworks The two frameworks for monetary policymaking I will compare today are generally referred to in the recent economics literature as instrument rules and targeting rules (Svensson, 2003; McCallum and Nelson, 2004; Svensson, 2004b).",2004-12-02
"However, the argument that monetary policy should adhere mechanically to a strict rule, made by some economists in the past, has fallen out of favor in recent years.",2004-12-02
"Under a simple feedback policy, the central bank's policy instrument--the federal funds rate in the United States--is closely linked to the behavior of a relatively small number of macroeconomic variables, variables that either are directly observable (such as employment or inflation) or can be estimated from current information (such as the economy's full-employment level of output).",2004-12-02
"I exclude from my definition of simple feedback policies any policy that links the policy instrument to forecasts of macroeconomic variables, such as output and inflation; hybrid policies of this type raise difficult issues that would take me too far afield today.",2004-12-02
"3 Generally, the macroeconomic variables that drive simple feedback policies are chosen to reflect the central bank's objectives, and policymakers are directed to adjust the short-term interest rate (or other policy instrument) as needed to offset deviations of these variables from their desired levels.",2004-12-02
In its most basic version the Taylor rule is an equation that relates the current setting of the federal funds rate to two variables: the level of the output gap (the deviation of output from its full-employment level) and the difference between the inflation rate and the policy committee's preferred inflation rate.,2004-12-02
"Like most feedback policies, the Taylor rule instructs policymakers to ""lean against the wind""; for example, when output is above its potential or inflation is above the target, the Taylor rule implies that the federal funds rate should be set above its average level, which (all else being equal) should slow the economy and bring output or inflation back toward the desired range.4 Numerous simple feedback policies other than those based on the Taylor rule have been proposed and analyzed.5 How does the use of simple feedback policies address the issues I raised earlier--namely, the problem of limited information and the need to account for private-sector expectations when making policy?",2004-12-02
"Because simple feedback policies link the central bank's policy instrument to a short list of macroeconomic variables, these policies should be relatively easy for the public to understand and to use in forming expectations of the way monetary policy will evolve in the future.",2004-12-02
"Say, for example, that the feedback policy employed by the central bank stipulates that, when inflation rises 10 basis points, policymakers will raise the short-term interest rate 15 basis points on average, subject to possible judgmental adjustments.",2004-12-02
"Armed with this information and their own estimates of how strong inflation pressures are likely to be over the next few quarters, financial market participants should be able to forecast future values of the short-term interest rate, allowing them to price bonds and other financial assets more efficiently.",2004-12-02
"Because, under a simple feedback policy, private-sector expectations are likely to be broadly consistent with the central bank's plans, the effectiveness of monetary policy would be enhanced as well.",2004-12-02
"The second general approach to making monetary policy is what I am today calling a forecast-based policy (Svensson, 2004c).",2004-12-02
"As the name suggests, under a forecast-based policy regime, policymakers must predict how the economy is likely to respond in the medium term--say, over the next six to eight quarters--to alternative plans for monetary policy.",2004-12-02
"For example, monetary policy makers might be interested in evaluating a strategy of keeping the federal funds rate low for a period against an alternative plan that implies a gradual rise in rates.",2004-12-02
Their current choice of interest rate corresponds to the first step in implementing the preferred plan.,2004-12-02
"Indeed, opponents of this approach argue, a major risk of using forecast-based policies is that monetary policy makers, like other human beings, may be prone to thinking that they know more than they really do.",2004-12-02
"Excessive optimism about what monetary policy can realistically accomplish, some claim, might conceivably lead to worse economic outcomes than would a more intellectually modest stance.",2004-12-02
Again the information requirements of forecast-based policies are relatively more demanding.,2004-12-02
"To the extent that policymakers can accurately communicate their outlook, objectives, and tactics to the public, financial markets will be more efficient and monetary policy more effective (Bernanke, 2004).",2004-12-02
"The Policy Framework of the Federal Reserve It would be nice, at this point, if I could tell you definitively whether simple feedback policies or forecast-based policies represent the superior approach to making monetary policy.",2004-12-02
"However, in my judgment, reliance on these two approaches is not symmetric; instead, the forecast-based approach has become increasingly dominant in the monetary policymaking of leading central banks.",2004-12-02
"This dominance is reflected in the resources that central banks devote to data collection and modeling and in the increasing sophistication and detail of central bank forecasts.9 Indeed, a number of central banks with explicit inflation objectives publish regular forecasts and closely link monetary policy decisions to those forecasts.",2004-12-02
"10 The Federal Reserve does not explicitly link policy actions to forecasts, but projections of how the economy is likely to perform under different policy plans are nevertheless central to the monetary policy process in the United States; that is, the Federal Reserve relies primarily on the forecast-based approach for making policy.",2004-12-02
"To provide some evidence for this assertion, as well as some reasons for it, I draw your attention to a speech that Chairman Greenspan made earlier this year, entitled ""Risk and Uncertainty in Monetary Policy"" (Greenspan, 2004).",2004-12-02
Early action works best both because monetary policy works with a lag and because developing problems (such as rising inflation) may often be defused at lower cost in their early stages.,2004-12-02
"Referring to monetary policy developments in the 1980s, Greenspan writes: In recognition of the lag in monetary policy's impact on economic activity, a preemptive response to the potential for building inflationary pressures was made an even more important feature of policy.",2004-12-02
"In the mid-1990s, Chairman Greenspan and his FOMC colleagues famously recognized an important structural change, an apparent increase in trend productivity growth.",2004-12-02
"To quote the Chairman's speech: As a consequence of the improving trend in structural productivity growth that was apparent from 1995 forward, we at the Fed were able to be much more accommodative to the rise in economic growth than our past experiences would have deemed prudent.",2004-12-02
"In short, upon determining that an important structural change was occurring, the FOMC did not feel constrained to respond to current developments in output and inflation as it had in the past--an indication that the Committee's policymaking was based on a forecast-based analysis, not a simple feedback approach.",2004-12-02
"Perhaps the most interesting confirmation of the role of forecasts in Federal Reserve policymaking, however, is Chairman Greenspan's description of what he calls the risk-management approach to monetary policy.",2004-12-02
"To reiterate, however, the policy framework espoused by Chairman Greenspan is very much a forecast-based approach; indeed, because it requires making judgments about unlikely as well as likely economic outcomes, it places greater demands on our ability to forecast and to assess risks than do simpler forecast-based approaches that focus on average outcomes only.",2004-12-02
"I note, however, that not only have most central banks chosen to rely most heavily on forecast-based policies but also that the results, at least in recent years, have generally been quite good, as most economies have enjoyed low inflation and overall economic stability.11 So long as this good performance persists, at least, the simple feedback approach will face a sort of Catch-22 problem: Without a demonstrated record of success, central banks will be reluctant to adopt this approach; but unless some central banks begin to rely on simple feedback policies, real-world evidence in support of this approach will be lacking.12 Flexibility and Communication In previous talks I have argued that clear communication by the central bank is an important element of effective monetary policy (Bernanke, 2004).",2004-12-02
"Central bank communication and transparency are important precisely because of the role of private-sector expectations in determining the effectiveness of monetary policy, a theme I have highlighted today.",2004-12-02
"The economic stimulus provided by monetary policy depends mostly on longer-term interest rates, which in turn are largely determined by the expectations of financial market participants about the future course of monetary policy.",2004-12-02
"As a general matter, the more guidance the central bank can provide the public about how policy is likely to evolve (or about the principles on which policy decisions will be based), the greater the chance that market participants will make appropriate inferences--and thus the greater the probability that long-term interest rates will move in a manner consistent with the outlook and objectives of the monetary policy committee.",2004-12-02
"The Bank of Israel moved from a single policymaker to a monetary policy committee in 2010, while I was governor there; more recently, central banks in India and New Zealand have handed over monetary policy to committees.",2017-03-03
"The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has been responsible for monetary policy decisions in the United States since it was established by the Banking Act of 1935, two decades after the founding of the Fed itself.2 The movement toward committees reflects the advantages of committees in aggregating a wide range of information, perspectives, and models.",2017-03-03
"Despite the prevalence and importance of committees in modern central banking, the role of committees in the formulation of policy has not attracted nearly as much academic attention as has the research on monetary policy rules.3 The literature on monetary policy rules stretches back to at least Adam Smith and includes important contributions from David Ricardo, Knut Wicksell, and Milton Friedman.More recently, John Taylor has moved the research agenda forward with his eponymous rule, and a large number of academic papers have been written examining the effectiveness and robustness of policy rules.4 In contrast, as noted, study of the role of committees in making monetary policy has been fairly light, notwithstanding the insightful work of Alan Blinder and others.5 Committees and rules may appear to be in opposition as approaches to policymaking.",2017-03-03
"One might even argue that if a central bank ever converged on a single monetary rule, there would be no need for a monetary policy committee.",2017-03-03
"In practice, the Fed operates through a committee structure and considers the recommendations of a variety of monetary rules as we make monetary policy decisions.",2017-03-03
"In contrast, the diversity of views that makes a committee work can sometimes pose a communications challenge, as the frequent complaints about the cacophony of messages coming out of the FOMC illustrate.6 In the remainder of my discussion, I would like to elaborate on some of the features of committees that have contributed to their prevalence in monetary policymaking.",2017-03-03
I will then discuss monetary policy rules and some of the difficulties in developing robust rules for policy.,2017-03-03
Why Do Almost All Central Banks Make Their Monetary Policy Decisions in a Committee?,2017-03-03
"Committees also tend to be less volatile or activist, imparting an inertia to policymaking that could be desirableâ€‘â€‘or perhaps undesirable when activism is required.8 Finally, academic studies have shown that a combination of forecasts is more accurate, over time, than a single forecast.9 Putting it all together, committees are, on average, likely to make better monetary policy decisions than individualsâ€‘â€‘an assertion that has received support from academic experiments in which undergraduate students played a part.",2017-03-03
"Notwithstanding the shift toward monetary policy committees, each central bank and its institutional structure reflects the politics and culture of the country that it serves (or ""countries"" in the case of the European Central Bank).",2017-03-03
Robust Rules for Monetary Policy I turn now to economic models and monetary policy rules.,2017-03-03
"As a basis for discussion, I will put some hypotheses on the table about the origin of the deficit, its course over time, and its implications for macroeconomic policy.",2002-11-22
"* For the most part, the existing distribution of current account surpluses and deficits among the countries of the world reflects market decisions regarding the global allocation of capital.",2002-11-22
"The upward trend in the foreign exchange value of the dollar since the mid-1990s as the deficit was climbing indicates that the rising demand for dollars from capital inflows, and not the rising supply of dollars from the trade deficit, was the dominating force in international transactions between the United States and the rest of the world.",2002-11-22
"Still, the remarkably similar asset price movements around the globe in the past two years and the relatively modest correction of the dollar imply that investors are not having major second thoughts about the relative distribution of their savings.",2002-11-22
"Moreover, judging from the fact that productivity in the United States did accelerate in the latter half of the 1990s and continues to grow rapidly, the spending financed through the deficit apparently did add to real GDP growth, even though the financial returns to capital proved disappointing.",2002-11-22
"The U.S. deficit has boosted aggregate demand outside the United States, which was especially beneficial in the mid- to late-1990s, when disruptions to capital flows and financial markets in many other countries were damping economic activity.",2002-11-22
"In the United States, the availability of foreign savings and foreign goods and services served as safety valves, diverting U.S. aggregate demand during the late 1990s, when it might have otherwise created inflationary pressures.",2002-11-22
"It is crucial in thinking about this deficit to keep in mind that, to the extent that it reflects an imbalance, the imbalance is shared around the world.",2002-11-22
The U.S. current account deficit is two-sided: Low saving relative to investment demand in the United States necessarily implies the reverse--a shortfall of domestic demand relative to production in the rest of the world.,2002-11-22
"U.S. and foreign asset prices, including the real exchange rate, will have to adjust to close the trade gap or, from another perspective, to bring domestic demand in the United States and elsewhere into closer alignment with domestic production.",2002-11-22
"Such a shift could be associated with large, sharp movements in exchange rates and other asset prices that might expose weaknesses in the balance sheets of some entities.",2002-11-22
"Even abstracting from financial vulnerabilities, such developments in financial markets might prompt dislocations in resource usage and temporary reductions in incomes because resources are slower to adjust than asset prices.",2002-11-22
"Moreover, although resource reallocations are never frictionless, major dislocations need not result from rapid movements in asset prices.",2002-11-22
"Indeed, the currently low level of capacity utilization in our manufacturing sector means that considerable resources are available to meet increased foreign demand without putting pressure on prices.",2002-11-22
The shifting balance of domestic demand and potential supply in each country means that policies affecting domestic demand will need to be re-calibrated to preserve price stability and keep economies operating at high levels of reserve utilization.,2002-11-22
"The deficit country--the United States--will need to generate more net domestic savings, perhaps through tighter government budgets, as it absorbs a greater share of global demand if it is to avoid inflation pressures and much higher real interest rates that damp investment and growth.",2002-11-22
"And, as demand is trimmed in the United States, surplus countries will have to boost domestic demand to forestall a slowing in global economic growth.",2002-11-22
"Over the long-run, using fiscal policy to boost domestic saving in the deficit country might help, but such an adjustment would be counterproductive now, when the U.S. economy is operating well below its potential.",2002-11-22
"Conversely, fiscal policy expansion in the surplus countries could be used to augment domestic demand, but any such adjustments would need to take account of medium-term goals for fiscal consolidation.",2002-11-22
"For example, in the late 1990s, the fiscal stance of the United States switched from deficits to surplus, and the switch was only partly offset by declines in private savings, leaving national savings higher.",2002-11-22
"Nonetheless, the current account deficit continued to grow as a result of the surge in U.S. investment and productivity and the associated capital inflows seeking the higher U.S. rates of return.",2002-11-22
Monetary policy has an ambiguous effect on trade imbalances.,2002-11-22
"Although exchange rates are notoriously difficult to predict, over time easier monetary policy relative to that abroad should prompt currency depreciation, which in turn would tend to reduce the current account deficit.",2002-11-22
"However, easier monetary policy also stimulates domestic incomes, which would tend to increase the current account deficit.",2002-11-22
"Simply put, monetary policy is not the appropriate tool for improving the current account.",2002-11-22
"Rather, central banks have learned over the years that their policies should be devoted to fostering macroeconomic balance and price stability.",2002-11-22
"In addition, as with equity market bubbles, one is hard put to know beforehand whether large current account deficits are out of line with fundamentals, especially when those outcomes could be a result of strong productivity and high rates of return rather than of excessive spending.",2002-11-22
"As I have emphasized, the major reason for the growing deficit has been that the United States has been an attractive place to invest, and such investment has helped foster higher productivity and economic potential at home and a more efficient use of foreign savings.",2002-11-22
Monetary and fiscal policy in the United States will continue to be aimed at fostering high employment and price stability and a favorable environment for growth in productivity and incomes.,2002-11-22
Total consumer price inflation as measured by the chain price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) has risen from 1.4 percent over the twelve months of last year to an annual rate of 3.0 percent over the first four months of 2004.,2004-06-04
"Of course, a portion of this acceleration is due to the faster increase in energy prices this year.",2004-06-04
But the strengthening in price increases has not been confined to energy markets.,2004-06-04
"PCE prices excluding food and energy have risen at an annual rate of 1.7 percent this year, up from 0.8 percent last year.",2004-06-04
The consumer price index has shown a similar pattern of acceleration.,2004-06-04
"The recent shift up in inflation can be seen not just in the price indexes but also in attitudes, anecdotes, and expectations.",2004-06-04
"Businesses report that the prices of many inputs to the production process are increasing, and they also sense a return of ""pricing power"" that has allowed them to pass on at least some of these cost increases to their customers; my impression is that of late a greater number of stories in general-circulation newspapers have focused on rising prices and their effect on households; and expectations by economists and households of near-term inflation have moved higher.",2004-06-04
The commitment of the Federal Reserve to maintaining price stability remains strong and unaltered.,2004-06-04
"Price stability is our responsibility, and the record of the past thirty-five years demonstrates how important it is that we meet it.",2004-06-04
Allowing businesses and households to plan and operate without worrying about increases in the general price level over the long run is how we contribute best to fostering economic efficiency and rising standards of living.,2004-06-04
"A number of members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), myself included, have been quite explicit in noting that the current level of the federal funds rate will not be consistent, over time, with the objective of preserving price stability.",2004-06-04
"The question is what path of tightening is likely to be necessary to accomplish that objective, and the answer to that question will depend critically on the behavior of inflation.",2004-06-04
"Although inflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon, the stance of policy--measured either by interest rates or liquidity provision--is not connected in a direct and simple way to the rate of inflation.",2004-06-04
"Individual prices are determined by supply and demand in the markets for goods and services, and the average of those prices by relationships of aggregate supply and demand.",2004-06-04
Monetary policy acts on inflation indirectly by altering the balance among the multiplicity of factors that affect supply and demand.,2004-06-04
"To make well-informed policy decisions, we need to analyze the elements behind the recent increase in inflation and form some judgment about its likely future course.",2004-06-04
"Like many economists, I believe the inflation process is influenced by a number of factors, chief among which are: the degree to which the productive capacity in the economy is being utilized; one-time shifts in product prices resulting from shocks to important supply and demand curves; changes in productivity growth; and inflation expectations.",2004-06-04
"This basic model is a rough approximation of a complex and constantly evolving mechanism of price determination, and its track record can hardly be considered flawless.1 But it does offer a useful framework for the analysis of inflation, and I am going to use it for that purpose here.",2004-06-04
"The analysis and views are my own, and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the FOMC.2 The Data Before beginning to examine the determinants of inflation, we need to remind ourselves of the inherently noisy nature of the price data.",2004-06-04
"They are highly variable month-to-month and quarter-to-quarter, and they are imperfect proxies for the true change in general prices.",2004-06-04
"As a consequence, discerning the underlying trend of inflation is no easy task.",2004-06-04
"Had I been speaking to you just a year ago, you would have expected me to address the possibility of deflation and what the Federal Reserve might do either to head it off or to deal with it once interest rates had reached zero.",2004-06-04
"In newspapers and in market reports, you would have read that the integration of China and India into the global trading system meant persistent excess supply of labor and products that would place downward pressure on wages and prices in the developed world for years to come.",2004-06-04
"Now the concern has shifted to whether inflation is rising, and those earlier stories are frequently being turned on their heads.",2004-06-04
"It is increasingly common to hear that strong demand for energy and other basic materials, importantly including demand from Asia, has been boosting inflation here.",2004-06-04
"To be sure, the underlying economic situation has changed over the past year--most particularly, growth has picked up in the United States and elsewhere around the world.",2004-06-04
"But actual circumstances probably have not shifted as dramatically as the commentary, which serves as a warning about how important it is to try to gauge the fundamental forces bearing on inflation so as to reduce the chances of being misled by noisy data.",2004-06-04
"In that regard, although a weak economy, associated slack in resource utilization, and rapid increases in productivity were undoubtedly reducing inflation last year, core inflation--especially as measured by the core CPI--seems to have fallen by more, and to a lower level, in 2003 than these fundamentals can explain.",2004-06-04
"Typically, such departures from historically normal behavior do not persist, and inflation tends to return to a level more in line with its fundamental determinants.",2004-06-04
"Indeed, the step-up in inflation this year from last year's pace may partly reflect such a return.",2004-06-04
"Within the CPI, the component called owners' equivalent rent, which accounts for nearly a quarter of the overall index, seems to have been an important factor in the surprising decline in inflation last year.",2004-06-04
"Some deceleration in rents is to be expected when low interest rates hold down the user cost of owning a home, favoring home ownership over renting.",2004-06-04
"However, owners' equivalent rent softened more than one would have predicted from historical relationships between rents and interest rates.",2004-06-04
"So far this year, owners' equivalent rent has risen at an annual rate of 3 percent, returning to a more typical relationship with interest rates and contributing to the pickup in core inflation.",2004-06-04
"Of course, even if some of the rebound in core consumer price inflation represents simply a reversal of some of the factors that kept inflation unusually low last year, other influences might be at work that would cause inflation to continue to rise.",2004-06-04
"To get a sense of whether we are on the cusp of worsening inflation, we must examine what might be affecting the supply and demand for goods and services.",2004-06-04
Determinants of Inflation Economic slack.,2004-06-04
Judgments about the source of the recent increase in inflation and the likely course of prices over the next year or so rest in part on an assessment of how close the economy is to producing at its long-run potential.,2004-06-04
"History indicates that when capital and labor are not fully employed, competition for market share and for jobs tends to push down the rate of inflation.3 Using measures of potential output and economic slack in real-time forecasting and policymaking presents daunting challenges.",2004-06-04
"That is because potential output is not something that can ever be observed and directly verified; we infer it from the behavior of other variables, including prices themselves, that we do observe.",2004-06-04
Estimating potential output and slack also is complicated by changes over time in labor and product markets that alter the degree of resource utilization that is consistent with stable inflation.,2004-06-04
"For about the past six months, the unemployment rate has averaged a little less than 5-3/4 percent.",2004-06-04
"This rate is down from its peak of about 6-1/4 percent in the middle of last year, but it is still somewhat above a level that, on the basis of the experience of the last decade or so, appears to be consistent with stable inflation.",2004-06-04
"If these effects are important, current consensus estimates of the natural rate of unemployment as well as of the ""natural rate of capacity utilization"" could overstate the degree of effective slack.",2004-06-04
"In the labor market, the behavior of compensation in recent years has been consistent with standard models of wage dynamics incorporating a natural rate still somewhat below the current unemployment rate.",2004-06-04
"Presumably, many of the people who exited the workforce in the face of poor employment prospects now stand ready to resume competing for jobs as the market improves.",2004-06-04
"If that is correct, then the current level of the unemployment rate relative to estimates of the natural rate, may, if anything, understate the availability of labor resources.",2004-06-04
"These survey data, as well as data on capacity from various trade sources, should fully reflect permanent plant closings within, at most, a year or so.4 Most measures of resource utilization have not changed very much from a year and more ago, when inflation was falling.",2004-06-04
The unemployment rate hovered near 5-3/4 percent through much of 2002 and the first quarter of 2003; capacity utilization has recovered only a fraction from its lowest level since the very deep recession of the early 1980s.,2004-06-04
The net decline in core measures of inflation over the past few years--even after taking account of possible understatement of inflation last year--is consistent with a noticeable gap in resource utilization still existing today.,2004-06-04
"Going forward, I anticipate continued strong growth in demand but, given persistent solid gains in productivity and potential output, only a gradual closing of the output gap.",2004-06-04
"Under these circumstances, ongoing competitive pressures in labor and product markets should help to contain cost and price increases.",2004-06-04
"The downward pressure will probably diminish over time, but at least for a while, economic slack should continue to operate as a restraining force on the overall trend in inflation.",2004-06-04
"But for now, I believe the balance of the evidence points to the conclusion that the recent rise in inflation probably does not signal that the economy has been producing beyond its sustainable potential, but rather that other causes have been at work.",2004-06-04
Price shocks.,2004-06-04
Quite a few prices have been pushed higher in recent quarters by special influences on the supply and demand for the specific products involved.,2004-06-04
"Such increases are probably contributing to the broad pickup in inflation that we have seen this year, but most likely they are not going to be a source of continuing upward pressure on prices.",2004-06-04
"It is not surprising that the substantial strengthening of aggregate demand here and abroad has boosted prices for inputs into the production process, with the most noticeable effects on products for which the short-run supply is relatively price-inelastic.",2004-06-04
"Increases in commodity prices are typical as an expansion gathers momentum, but they have been unusually large in the current episode because of the synchronous strengthening here and overseas, especially in Asia.",2004-06-04
"Petroleum prices have been under particular pressure, reflecting not only stronger demand but also risks that supplies could be constrained by terrorism or political disruption.",2004-06-04
The decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar over the past year or so has contributed to the rise in the price of imports in the United States.,2004-06-04
"The prices of core non-energy imports began to increase more rapidly than the general level of core consumer prices in 2003, and the difference widened in the first quarter of this year, adding to general price increases.",2004-06-04
"Commodities and imports are only a small part of what we consume, and changes in their prices as well as in the price of energy usually do not affect measured core consumer inflation very much.",2004-06-04
"But the recent situation has been notable for the size and number of price shocks going in the same direction, so that even with limited pass-though of individual price movements, the total effect probably has been significant.",2004-06-04
"Judging from the results of statistical models incorporating the factors we have been examining, increases in commodity, energy and import prices together might have boosted core consumer inflation on the order of roughly 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point over the past four quarters.",2004-06-04
But we are already seeing evidence of the limited nature of these types of price-level adjustments.,2004-06-04
"The prices of many non-energy commodities have come down from their peaks lately, perhaps reflecting an actual or expected moderation of growth in Asia and ongoing demand and supply responses to higher prices.",2004-06-04
"Energy prices have continued to climb, but futures markets see some moderation of these prices getting under way before long.",2004-06-04
"If these circumstances prevail, shocks to commodity, energy, and import prices should no longer be adding as much to inflation.",2004-06-04
"Of course, over the longer haul, whether or not these one-off shifts in the price level lead to ongoing price inflation will be determined by their effects on inflation expectations and the response of monetary policy, an issue I will refer to shortly.",2004-06-04
Productivity.,2004-06-04
The rate of increase in productivity also can have important effects on inflation pressures.,2004-06-04
"In the past few years, for example, the juxtaposition of very rapid productivity growth and weak aggregate demand has resulted in the slack in resource utilization I talked about earlier, which contributed to the decrease in inflation.",2004-06-04
But productivity growth also influences inflation through its effects on labor compensation and profit margins.,2004-06-04
"Over the long run, real labor compensation tends to track labor productivity.",2004-06-04
"This implies that when productivity accelerates, compensation eventually will as well.",2004-06-04
"The record of the post-World War II period suggests, however, that changes in compensation tend to lag well behind changes in productivity trends.",2004-06-04
"Thus, when underlying productivity growth picks up, firms tend to enjoy a wider profit margin for a time because unit labor costs tend initially to decelerate.",2004-06-04
The economy can enjoy the fruits of more rapid productivity growth for a while in the form of unusually high levels of production without added inflation or in the form of lower inflation.,2004-06-04
We realized some of each in the last half of the 1990s after productivity growth picked up.,2004-06-04
"Over time, as compensation catches up to productivity, profit margins tend to come back toward more normal levels, and output must return to its long-run potential if inflation is to be avoided.",2004-06-04
Productivity increased especially rapidly through the recent downturn and the initial stages of the subsequent expansion.,2004-06-04
"We will not know for some time with any degree of confidence whether this increase marked a further pickup in structural productivity growth--that is, over and above the already rapid rate of increase of the late 1990s.",2004-06-04
We can be reasonably certain that a portion of the extraordinary increase in productivity over the past few years was a response to the particular circumstances that were prevailing.,2004-06-04
"The extraordinary increase in productivity in recent years reduced unit labor costs and elevated profit margins to near record levels, even as inflation continued to decline.",2004-06-04
"I think we can anticipate that productivity growth will remain strong on a sustained basis, even if it is unlikely to match the outsized gains of the past few years.",2004-06-04
"Meanwhile, compensation growth should strengthen as labor markets tighten and businesses bid harder for labor to take advantage of profit opportunities.",2004-06-04
"Nonetheless, the high level of business profit margins suggests that, even if unit labor costs begin to rise more quickly than prices, the effect on inflation could be muted for a time because firms would have room to absorb some of the cost increases in the form of reduced profit margins.",2004-06-04
The initial surge in productivity showed up mostly in higher profit margins in 1996 and 1997.,2004-06-04
"From 1998 through 2000, as compensation caught up to productivity, unit labor costs rose more rapidly than prices without placing inflation under significant upward pressure.",2004-06-04
But elevated margins provide some cushion against cost pressures being passed through to prices--so long as the central bank does not allow excess demand to develop in product markets.,2004-06-04
Inflation expectations.,2004-06-04
Inflation expectations play a key role in price determination.,2004-06-04
"Among other effects, a rise in inflation expectations tends to become self-fulfilling as people seek to protect themselves in the process of setting wages and prices.",2004-06-04
"Expectations of price increases over the near-term--specifically, over the next year--have, in fact, risen noticeably on the heels of the actual increase in inflation.",2004-06-04
"But, as I have discussed, some of the price shocks giving rise to the increase in inflation in the past few months look as though they are unlikely to be repeated and may already be in the process of partially reversing, and expectations should subside with actual inflation.",2004-06-04
"Moreover, available surveys suggest that the recent uptick in total and core inflation has not materially affected expectations of inflation over the longer term.",2004-06-04
"This stability of long-term inflation expectations is evident in the Survey of Professional Forecasters, conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, and in the median expectations of households responding to the University of Michigan survey.",2004-06-04
"However, the pattern of inflation compensation in Treasury securities markets has been less reassuring.",2004-06-04
A widening of the spread between the ten-year nominal and ten-year indexed securities is not itself surprising; part of that widening is accounted for by the increase in short-term inflation expectations.,2004-06-04
But part could be read also as signaling investor concerns about inflation over a more distant horizon.,2004-06-04
Changes in this spread can be a misleading indicator of inflation expectations.,2004-06-04
"It is affected by idiosyncratic movements in either nominal or indexed yields, and it reflects changing liquidity in these markets and compensation for inflation risk as well as for inflation itself.",2004-06-04
Long-term inflation expectations firmly anchored at price stability make the task of keeping inflation low much easier.,2004-06-04
"The Federal Reserve has made plain its commitment to preserving price stability, and I am confident that we would act decisively to counter any deterioration in longer-run inflation expectations that threatened that objective.",2004-06-04
Summary and Policy Implications The evidence and analysis I have just reviewed suggest that the recent pickup in price increases probably does not represent the leading edge of steadily worsening inflation.,2004-06-04
"Much of the acceleration in the early months of this year likely reflects a rebound from unexplainably low inflation last year and the feed-through of increases in commodity, energy, and import prices.",2004-06-04
"The best indications are that some economic slack persists and that long-term inflation expectations are stable, which bolsters the inference that the economy has not entered a situation of steadily rising inflation.",2004-06-04
"Commodity, energy, and import prices are unlikely to continue moving up at the speed of recent quarters.",2004-06-04
Productivity growth is still strong.,2004-06-04
"As a result, inflation is most likely to remain at levels consistent with a continuation of effective price stability.",2004-06-04
"That said, the federal funds rate cannot be held at its current level indefinitely if price stability is to be preserved.",2004-06-04
The very accommodative stance of policy--including both the low level of the funds rate and the FOMC's indications that it was intending to hold it at that level for a while--was put in place to counter unusually weak demand and declining inflation.,2004-06-04
The challenge we face is to remove the accommodation in such a way as to foster both the return to full employment and the maintenance of price stability.,2004-06-04
"Because I believe that the rise in inflation will be limited and because I agree that growth of output is likely to only moderately exceed the growth of the economy's potential, I supported the FOMC's assessment at its last meeting that accommodation likely can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.",2004-06-04
"There is much about the inflation process that we do not understand, and I have been surprised at the extent of the pickup in core inflation this year.",2004-06-04
"Moreover, measures of inflation expectations will require careful scrutiny as we move forward.",2004-06-04
"An examination of the variables believed to proxy for aggregate demand and potential supply can help to explain inflation and to forecast future price developments, and the concepts are integral to making monetary policy.",2004-06-04
"For much of the period since World War II, at least until recently, the debate has been carried on mainly between those favoring the use of rules for making monetary policy and those arguing for reliance on discretion.",2003-02-03
"Under a strict rules-based approach to monetary policy, advocated most prominently by Milton Friedman and his followers, the policy instruments of the central bank would be set according to some simple and publicly announced formula, with little or no scope for modification or discretionary action on the part of policymakers.",2003-02-03
"Friedman believed that such a rule would have the important advantage of preventing major monetary policy errors, as when the Federal Reserve permitted the U.S. money supply to collapse in the 1930s--a blunder that contributed substantially to the severity of the Great Depression.",2003-02-03
"In addition, Friedman argued, a rule of this type would have the advantages of simplicity, predictability, and credibility, and it would help insulate monetary policy from outside political pressures and what Friedman saw as an inherent tendency toward excessive policy activism.",2003-02-03
"Neither the k-percent rule nor any comparably strict policy rule has ever been implemented, but ""rule-like"" monetary policy arrangements have existed in the real world.",2003-02-03
"Under the gold standard, at least in principle, the central bank's responsibility regarding monetary policy extended only so far as ensuring that the value of the currency in terms of gold was stabilized at the legally specified value.",2003-02-03
"In short, under a strict gold standard the monetary policy rule would be, ""Maintain the price of gold at so many dollars per ounce.""",2003-02-03
"Although the gold standard system malfunctioned and ultimately collapsed during the chaotic economic and financial conditions that followed World War I, many economic historians have credited it with promoting price stability and robust international trade and capital flows during 1870-1913, the so-called classical gold standard era.1 Another example of a rule-like monetary policy institution is a currency board, such as the ones currently employed by Hong Kong and several eastern European nations.",2003-02-03
"On the other side of the debate, advocates of discretion have firmly rejected the use of strict rules for policy, arguing that central bankers must be left free to set monetary policy as they see fit, based on their best judgment and the use of all relevant information.",2003-02-03
"Supporters of discretion contend that policy rules of the type advocated by Friedman are simply too mechanical and inflexible for use in real world policymaking; in particular, simple rules cannot fully accommodate special circumstances or unanticipated events.2 During the past few decades, for example, financial innovation and new transactions technologies have led to large and difficult-to-predict changes in the empirical relationship between money growth and the rates of growth of output and prices.",2003-02-03
"If central banks had slavishly followed Friedman's k-percent rule for money growth during this period, critics point out, substantial economic instability would have been the likely result; indeed, most central banks have de-emphasized money growth as a policy target or indicator in recent years.",2003-02-03
"Although a strict rules-based framework for monetary policy has evident drawbacks, notably its inflexibility in the face of unanticipated developments, supporters of rules in their turn have pointed out--with considerable justification--that the record of monetary policy under unfettered discretion is nothing to crow about.",2003-02-03
"In the United States, the heyday of discretionary monetary policy can be dated as beginning in the early 1960s, a period of what now appears to have been substantial over-optimism about the ability of policymakers to ""fine-tune"" the economy.",2003-02-03
"Contrary to the expectation of that era's economists and policymakers, however, the subsequent two decades were characterized not by an efficiently managed, smoothly running economic machine but by high and variable inflation and an unstable real economy, culminating in the deep 1981-82 recession.",2003-02-03
"Although a number of factors contributed to the poor economic performance of this period, I think most economists would agree that the deficiencies of a purely discretionary approach to monetary policy--including over-optimism about the ability of policy to fine-tune the economy, low credibility, vulnerability to political pressures, short policy horizons, and insufficient appreciation of the costs of high inflation--played a central role.",2003-02-03
"My thesis today is that there is such a middle ground--an approach that I will refer to as constrained discretion--and that it is fast becoming the standard approach to monetary policy around the world, including in the United States.4 As I will explain, constrained discretion is an approach that allows monetary policymakers considerable leeway in responding to economic shocks, financial disturbances, and other unforeseen developments.",2003-02-03
"Importantly, however, this discretion of policymakers is constrained by a strong commitment to keeping inflation low and stable.",2003-02-03
"In practice, I will argue, this approach has allowed central banks to achieve better outcomes in terms of both inflation and unemployment, confounding the traditional view that policymakers must necessarily trade off between the important social goals of price stability and high employment.",2003-02-03
"I will then explain why I think constrained discretion is the best operating framework for monetary policy, and in particular why it constitutes the best approach for achieving the economic goals that the Congress has set for the Fed.",2003-02-03
"Finally, I will briefly discuss the close relationship between constrained discretion and the strategy for monetary policy known as inflation targeting.",2003-02-03
The approach to monetary policy that I call constrained discretion can be defined by two simple and parsimonious principles.,2003-02-03
"First, through its words and (especially) its actions, the central bank must establish a strong commitment to keeping inflation low and stable.",2003-02-03
"Second, subject to the condition that inflation be kept low and stable, and to the extent possible given our uncertainties about the structure of the economy and the effects of policy, monetary policy should strive to limit cyclical swings in resource utilization.",2003-02-03
"In short, under constrained discretion, the central bank is free to do its best to stabilize output and employment in the face of short-run disturbances, with the appropriate caution born of our imperfect knowledge of the economy and of the effects of policy.",2003-02-03
"However, a critical proviso is that, in conducting stabilization policy, the central bank must also maintain a strong commitment to keeping inflation--and, hence, public expectations of inflation--firmly under control.",2003-02-03
"Because monetary policy influences inflation with a lag, keeping inflation under control may sometimes require the central bank to anticipate and move in advance of inflationary developments--that is, to engage in ""preemptive strikes"" on inflation.",2003-02-03
"In my view, constrained discretion characterizes the current monetary policy framework of the United States.",2003-02-03
"First, since the Fed under Chairman Paul Volcker broke the back of inflation in the early 1980s, inflation in the United States has been both declining and becoming more stable.",2003-02-03
"From a high of nearly 10 percent in 1980, inflation (as measured by the core PCE deflator, twelve-month rate of change) fell to 4 percent by the end of 1984 and to 3 percent by the end of 1992.5 Inflation breached the 2 percent barrier in the spring of 1996 and has remained consistently within the narrow range of 1.5 to 2 percent for the past six and a half years--for practical purposes, a good approximation to price stability.6 Likewise, expected inflation--as measured by financial-market indicators as well as surveys of both professional forecasters and consumers--has stabilized at a low level.",2003-02-03
"Thus, the Fed in recent years has demonstrated a commitment to keeping inflation low and stable--the first principle of constrained discretion.",2003-02-03
"The Fed's commitment to low inflation has not, however, prevented it from being flexible in implementing policy in the short term; in particular, the Fed has not been precluded from responding to adverse shocks to the economy (the second principle).",2003-02-03
"Since the taming of inflation by the Volcker Fed, the United States has faced two recessions, in 1990-91 and in 2001.",2003-02-03
"Importantly, inflation and inflation expectations seem to have been virtually unaffected by this large move--a direct benefit, I argue, of the Fed's previous investment in establishing a commitment to price stability.",2003-02-03
"Moreover, both output and employment have become considerably more stable in the past twenty years, relative to previous decades--a result I attribute in substantial part to improvements in monetary policy.7 The Fed has also responded aggressively and flexibly to crisis conditions in financial markets, in episodes ranging from the 1987 stock market crash to the 1998 Russian crisis to the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.",2003-02-03
"In the United States, the Congress has assigned to the Federal Reserve the objectives of maintaining price stability, maximum employment, and moderate long-term nominal interest rates.",2003-02-03
"Because the Fed appears to an increasing degree to be following a policy of what I have called constrained discretion, one must ask: Is this policy approach consistent with the Congress's mandate for monetary policy?",2003-02-03
"Broadly, there are three reasons why successful monetary policy is built on a foundation of price stability, as implied by the framework of constrained discretion.",2003-02-03
"First, of course, price stability is one of the objectives for monetary policy set by the Congress and, indeed, is highly desirable in its own right.",2003-02-03
"And, of course, the price level is the macroeconomic variable over which a central bank exerts the most direct control in the long run.",2003-02-03
"Second, in the long run price stability promotes high employment and low nominal interest rates--the other objectives set by the Congress--as well as productivity and economic growth.",2003-02-03
"Third, and most subtly, in the short run a record of consistently low inflation increases central bank credibility and stabilizes inflation expectations, effects that in turn actually increase the flexibility of the central bank to respond to shocks to the economy.",2003-02-03
"I will discuss each of these points, beginning with the importance of price stability in the long run and then turning to the short-run issues.",2003-02-03
"Price stability and economic performance in the long run Constrained discretion, at its foundation, recognizes the critical importance of maintaining price stability, both in the long run and in the short run.",2003-02-03
"The desirability of maintaining price stability in the long run is by now hardly a matter for dispute, with virtually all economists in agreement that, in the long run, low inflation confers many benefits on the economy.",2003-02-03
"Most fundamentally, only when inflation is low do nominal--that is, dollar--values provide a reasonably stable measure of real economic values.",2003-02-03
"Although economists are used to the idea of ""real"" or inflation-adjusted quantities, making inflation adjustments in practice requires significant information, expertise, and effort.",2003-02-03
"Thus, instability in the price level significantly impedes the ability of the typical household to make long-term financial plans, for example, or to compare prices of goods and services separated in space and time.",2003-02-03
"(In a high-inflation economy, price information grows ""stale"" more quickly than newly baked bread.)",2003-02-03
"Planning, investment, and pricing decisions by firms are likewise complicated and often distorted by inflation.",2003-02-03
"Because prices constitute the market economy's fundamental means of conveying information, the increased ""noise"" that inflation adds to prices raises transactions costs and erodes the efficiency of the free market system.",2003-02-03
"In a similar vein, as economist Martin Feldstein has frequently pointed out, price stability permits contracts, tax laws, accounting rules, and the like to be expressed in nominal (dollar) terms without concern about fluctuations in the value of money.8 If prices are instead variable and unpredictable, then contracts or laws written in dollar terms will produce unintended and probably undesired economic outcomes.9 Feldstein, for example, has emphasized how the interaction of inflation with the tax code leads to unintended increases in the real cost of capital, which inhibit investment and reduce economic growth.",2003-02-03
"Likewise, because debt contracts are written in nominal terms, unanticipated inflation transfers wealth from creditors to debtors, adding to the risk of financial contracting and at times posing a significant threat to the financial system itself.",2003-02-03
"For example, the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s, which cost U.S. taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars, was to a substantial extent the result of the unexpected inflation of the 1970s, which greatly reduced the real value of mortgage loans made by the S&Ls in an earlier, low-inflation era.",2003-02-03
"Given the Congress's mandate to the Federal Reserve, the long-run relationship between price stability and employment is an issue of particular importance.",2003-02-03
"That is, it was thought that by accepting a modest increase in the inflation rate, policy could achieve a permanently lower rate of unemployment.",2003-02-03
"Both economic theory and U.S. economic experience have shown this view to have been in error, and that no long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment exists is now widely accepted.",2003-02-03
"Indeed, because price stability promotes efficiency, productivity, and capital investment, one can reasonably presume that low inflation actually increases employment and real wages in the long run.",2003-02-03
"Because price stability also promotes moderate long-term nominal interest rates, a commitment to price stability clearly is fully consistent in the long run with the objectives set by the Congress.",2003-02-03
Price stability and economic performance in the short run That price stability is beneficial to the economy in the long run is well established.,2003-02-03
"As economists and policymakers have increasingly come to recognize, however, the benefits of a commitment to price stability in the short run are probably at least as significant.",2003-02-03
"I think it worthwhile, before discussing the short-run benefits of price stability for the economy, to note the simple fact that, historically, periods of unstable prices have also tended to be periods of marked instability in output and employment.",2003-02-03
"In the nine decades since the founding of the Federal Reserve System, the United States has experienced two large, sustained departures from price stability.",2003-02-03
"The first was the precipitous deflation of 1929-33, during which prices fell at a rate of about 10 percent per year; the second was the prolonged inflationary period that began in the latter part of the 1960s and did not end until the early 1980s.",2003-02-03
"Of course, each of these episodes was associated not only with instability of prices but also with exceptionally poor economic performance more generally.",2003-02-03
"The inflation that began in the United States in the second half of the 1960s was associated with slow growth, bouts of high unemployment, and instability in economic activity, including the two worst recessions of the postwar period in 1973-75 and 1981-82.",2003-02-03
What is the link between price instability and instability in output and employment in the short run?,2003-02-03
"In a previous talk I focused on the risks, so evident in the 1930s, that uncontrolled deflation poses for the economy, and I doubt that many of my listeners today will require much convincing on that point.10 So that no misunderstanding occurs, however, let me state clearly that the commitment to price stability under constrained discretion entails strict avoidance of deflation as well as of inflation.",2003-02-03
"That said, I will concentrate for the remainder of the talk on the risks that inflation creates for economic stability in the short run.",2003-02-03
"For illustration, I will emphasize the U.S. ""Great Inflation,"" the experience of the late 1960s through the early 1980s.",2003-02-03
"The primary cause of the Great Inflation, most economists would agree, was over-expansionary monetary and fiscal policies, beginning in the mid-1960s and continuing, in fits and starts, well into the 1970s.",2003-02-03
"Monetary policy first accommodated the fiscal expansion, and then--for reasons I will note--began to power the inflationary surge on its own.",2003-02-03
The breakdown of the price stability that had characterized the 1950s and early 1960s was remarkably quick; inflation was perceived as a problem by the late sixties.,2003-02-03
"Though temporarily restrained by the Nixon price controls, inflation (again as measured by the core PCE deflator) rose from 2.6 percent in February 1973 to 9.8 percent in February 1975.",2003-02-03
"After the deep 1973-75 recession, inflation fell back to the range of 6 to 7 percent for several years before rising again to 9.8 percent in September 1980.",2003-02-03
"Like inflation, the real economy was also highly volatile during this whole period.",2003-02-03
"The civilian unemployment rate, below 4 percent throughout the second half of the 1960s, rose above 6 percent during the 1969-70 recession, declined briefly, then rose again to 9 percent in May 1975.",2003-02-03
"Unemployment declined slowly from there, falling below 6 percent only in late 1978 and early 1979.",2003-02-03
"But during the 1981-82 recession, unemployment peaked at 10.8 percent--a rate not seen since the 1930s--and remained above 10 percent as late as June 1983.",2003-02-03
"Taking the inflation and unemployment performance together, one should not be surprised that a recent chronicler of the period called the Great Inflation the 1970s ""the greatest failure of American macroeconomic policy in the postwar period"" (Mayer, 1998, p. 1).",2003-02-03
"Critically, although Fed officials often mentioned the importance of keeping inflation low during the 1960s and 1970s, the record of inflation outcomes during that period shows that their commitment to maintaining price stability was spotty.",2003-02-03
"Several factors contributed to the Federal Reserve's inflationary policies, including the political pressures exerted by the Johnson and Nixon administrations (Mayer, 1998, chapter 5).",2003-02-03
"Mistakes of analysis--among them a tendency to blame nonpolicy factors (such as union wage pressures) for inflation, a misplaced belief in the potential efficacy of wage-price controls, and overly optimistic assessments of the economy's growth potential in both the 1960s (DeLong, 1997; Romer and Romer, 2002) and early 1970s (Orphanides, 2001)--also played a key role.",2003-02-03
"Yet another miscalculation, particularly important in the early stages of the Great Inflation, was the already-mentioned idea of an exploitable long-run tradeoff, according to which policymakers supposedly would be able to achieve permanently lower unemployment by accepting a bit more inflation.11 Indeed, initially the tradeoff idea appeared to be valid, for unemployment fell while inflation rose only moderately during the latter part of the 1960s.",2003-02-03
"However, as we now understand, in this early period the Fed was living off the capital of two previous decades of price stability, which had conditioned the public to expect low inflation.",2003-02-03
"Because the period began with expected inflation under control, monetary expansion in the latter part of the 1960s stimulated real spending and production without leading immediately to wage and price pressures.",2003-02-03
"As the public woke up to the new reality of high and rising inflation, however, inflation expectations began to rise as well.",2003-02-03
"Within a few years, the Federal Reserve found itself in a situation in which inflation and inflation expectations had risen considerably, while the earlier gains in terms of lower unemployment and higher growth had dissipated.",2003-02-03
The high and erratic inflation of this period contributed to instability of output and employment in a number of ways.,2003-02-03
"The Fed understood in principle that stabilizing inflation and inflation expectations was important, but--knowing that a slowdown in spending and output (of a magnitude difficult to guess) would be an unwelcome side effect--it was extremely reluctant to tighten monetary policy enough to do the job.",2003-02-03
"First, over-expansion led to inflation, the ""go"" phase.",2003-02-03
"Then, periodically, when inflation became bad enough, the Fed would tighten policy (the ""stop"" phase), only to loosen again when the resulting slowdown in the economy began to manifest itself.",2003-02-03
"The net result of this policy pattern was to exacerbate greatly the instability of both inflation and unemployment, while making little progress toward restoring price stability or re-anchoring inflation expectations.",2003-02-03
"This cycle ended only under Chairman Volcker, who (together with his colleagues on the FOMC) had the courage to keep policy tight until inflation and inflation expectations finally began to stabilize in the early 1980s.",2003-02-03
"Of course, the cost of this critical stabilization was the high unemployment and lost output associated with the sharp 1981-82 recession.",2003-02-03
The second link between the instability of inflation and that of unemployment in the Great Inflation operated through the behavior of inflation expectations.,2003-02-03
"As I have noted, when the episode began in the 1960s, inflation expectations were well anchored, in the sense that the public was conditioned by long experience to expect low inflation.",2003-02-03
"Hence, the first expansionary policy moves of the 1960s did succeed in raising output and employment without much initial effect on prices.",2003-02-03
"As demand pressures accumulated and inflation rose, however, the Fed's credibility as an inflation-fighter was lost and inflation expectations began to rise.",2003-02-03
"The unmooring of inflation expectations greatly complicated the process of making monetary policy; in particular, the Fed's loss of credibility significantly increased the cost of achieving disinflation.",2003-02-03
"The severity of the 1981-82 recession, the worst of the postwar period, clearly illustrates the danger of letting inflation get out of control.",2003-02-03
"This recession was so exceptionally deep precisely because of the monetary policies of the preceding fifteen years, which had unanchored inflation expectations and squandered the Fed's credibility.",2003-02-03
"Because inflation and inflation expectations remained stubbornly high when the Fed tightened, the impact of rising interest rates was felt primarily on output and employment rather than on prices, which continued to rise.12 One indication of the loss of credibility suffered by the Fed by the time of the 1981-82 episode, and the difficulty of getting it back once lost, was the behavior of long-term nominal interest rates.",2003-02-03
"For example, the yield on 10-year Treasuries peaked at 15.3 percent in September 1981--almost two years after Volcker's Fed announced its disinflationary program in October 1979--suggesting that long-term inflation expectations were at that point still in the double digits.",2003-02-03
"Remarkably, 30-year Treasury yields were only slightly lower than 10-year yields throughout the episode, implying that the markets had no confidence that inflation would ever return to 1950s or 1960s levels.",2003-02-03
The behavior of long-term nominal interest rates in the early 1980s can be contrasted with that of more recent years.,2003-02-03
"Today the 10-year Treasury yield is approximately 4 percent, suggesting substantial confidence on the part of financial market practitioners that inflation will remain low for the next decade.",2003-02-03
"Indeed, we have the benefit of a developed market for indexed debt to make that inference more precise: The expected inflation rate inferred from the yield on 10-year inflation-protected Treasury bonds is now about 2.0 percent for CPI inflation.",2003-02-03
"Also notable is the fact that the substantial easing of monetary policy during 2001 appeared to generate no concerns about future inflation, as evidenced by the record low long-term interest rates and stable survey-based inflation expectations that we are still seeing.",2003-02-03
You may have noticed that I have discussed the Great Inflation of the 1970s with an emphasis on Federal Reserve behavior but without mentioning oil prices.,2003-02-03
"My reading of the evidence suggests that the role the conventional wisdom has attributed to oil price increases in the stagflation of the 1970s has been overstated, for two reasons.",2003-02-03
"First, the large increases in oil prices that occurred in this period would not have been possible in an environment that was not already highly inflationary because of previous monetary expansion.",2003-02-03
"They note, for example, that prices of other industrial commodities and raw materials rose substantially at the same time as oil prices, suggesting that broader monetary forces--and not factors specific to the oil market--account for much of the rise in the oil price in 1973.13 Second, without Fed accommodation, higher oil prices abroad would not have translated into domestic inflation to any significant degree.",2003-02-03
"To see this point, note that oil prices do not directly affect the measure of inflation that I have been using here--the change in the core PCE deflator, which excludes energy prices.",2003-02-03
"Thus, any link of oil prices to inflation must be through so-called second-round effects, in which increased fuel prices push up wages and other costs.",2003-02-03
"Comparison of the 1970s and the 1990s confirms the common finding in the literature that the degree of ""pass-through"" to core inflation from supply shocks, such as a rise in oil prices or a depreciation of the exchange rate, depends strongly on how well domestic expectations of inflation are anchored.14 Because inflation expectations were not well anchored in the 1970s, the oil price shocks were in fact associated with substantial pass-through, that is, increases in core inflation.",2003-02-03
"As already noted, core PCE inflation rose by a whopping 7 percentage points in the years 1973-74, the period of the sharpest increase in oil prices.",2003-02-03
"In the 1990s, by contrast, oil price changes seemed to have no noticeable effect on core inflation.",2003-02-03
"For example, the price of oil at the end of 1998 was a little more than $11 per barrel; over the next two years the price of oil tripled, exceeding $34 per barrel late in 2000.",2003-02-03
"Then, over the subsequent year, the price of oil suddenly reversed itself, dropping 40 percent.",2003-02-03
"Despite these gyrations, core inflation remained firmly anchored throughout the period, registering between 1.5 percent and 2.0 percent on a twelve-month basis in every month.",2003-02-03
"Although structural changes have occurred in the economy since the 1970s, including increased energy efficiency, this difference in the degree of pass-through from oil prices to general inflation can be explained, in my view, only by differences in the stability of inflation and inflation expectations.",2003-02-03
"Overall, it is reasonable to conclude that macro policy, particularly monetary policy, was the most important single reason for the poor economic performance experienced during the U.S. Great Inflation.",2003-02-03
Constrained discretion and inflation targeting I mentioned at the beginning of the talk that constrained discretion characterizes at least to some degree the policy approach of many of the major central banks around the world.,2003-02-03
"It is, in fact, closely related to the policy framework known as inflation targeting.",2003-02-03
"Let me take a moment to explain the relationship between what I have termed ""constrained discretion"" and the more familiar concept of inflation targeting.",2003-02-03
"It is useful, I think, to divide monetary policymaking into two parts--roughly, what you do and what you say about it.",2003-02-03
The details of inflation-targeting regimes vary by country and have evolved over time.,2003-02-03
"Broadly speaking, however, the operational, or ""what you do,"" side of what I consider to be best-practice inflation targeting is well described as constrained discretion, as I have characterized it here.15 Specifically, most inflation-targeting central banks try to stabilize output and employment subject to the constraint that inflation remain low and stable--in the case of formal inflation targeters, of course, within the declared target range for inflation.",2003-02-03
"As I have noted, constrained discretion also describes reasonably well the recent policy approach of the Federal Reserve, though of course the Fed does not have publicly announced inflation targets.",2003-02-03
"Thus, on the operational side, the policy frameworks of the Federal Reserve and of the leading central banks with formal inflation targets are today rather similar.",2003-02-03
"The second element of inflation targeting--the communication, or ""what you say,"" side--consists of not only a public announcement of a target range for inflation (the hallmark of inflation targeting) but also a variety of other mechanisms for talking to markets and the public.",2003-02-03
"These include the regular publication of so-called Inflation Reports, release of forecasts, prompt release of minutes, and other measures.",2003-02-03
"Here is the principal area in which the Federal Reserve--though it has certainly become markedly more transparent in the past decade--has not chosen to adopt the whole framework of inflation targeting.16 Many have concluded that central banks that have adopted the transparency and communication aspects of inflation targeting have strengthened their overall policy performance--through enhanced communication to the public of their objectives and plans, improved management of expectations, greater consistency of policy, and heightened accountability.17 The Fed has much in common with other major central banks, but of course it also differs in important ways, including its history, legal framework, and institutional structure.",2003-02-03
Conclusion My objective today has been to lay out the advantages of using a framework of constrained discretion for making monetary policy.,2003-02-03
The essence of constrained discretion is the central role of a commitment to price stability.,2003-02-03
"Not only does such a commitment enhance efficiency, employment, and economic growth in the long run, but--by providing an anchor for inflation expectations--it also improves the ability of central banks to stabilize the real economy in the short run as well.",2003-02-03
"An important and interesting implication is that, under a properly designed and implemented monetary policy regime, the key social objectives of price stability and maximum employment tend to be mutually reinforcing rather than competing goals.",2003-02-03
"To the best of my knowledge, this term was first used in connection with monetary policy by Bernanke and Mishkin (1997).",2003-02-03
Throughout this talk I follow a common Fed practice in using the core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) deflator to measure inflation.,2003-02-03
"Relative to the more familiar consumer price index (CPI), the PCE deflator (1) has broader coverage, (2) is believed to be based on more accurate expenditure weights, (3) is constructed in a manner that reduces so-called substitution bias, (4) is measured more consistently over time, and (5) arguably does a better job measuring medical inflation.",2003-02-03
"The core PCE deflator excludes volatile components, notably the prices of food and energy.",2003-02-03
"Core inflation measures in general are probably better indicators of the underlying rate of inflation, with which central banks are typically most concerned.",2003-02-03
Standard inflation measures probably overstate increases in true inflation by about 1.0 percentage point.,2003-02-03
"For example, Lebow and Rudd (2002) estimate that measured inflation using the consumer price index overstates the actual change in the cost of living by about 0.9 percentage points per year, with a confidence interval ranging from 0.3 percentage point to l.4 percentage points per year.",2003-02-03
"In addition, as I discussed in a previous talk, aiming for an inflation rate modestly above zero provides a useful buffer against deflation risk.",2003-02-03
Stock and Watson (2002) note that the standard deviation of annual growth rates in real GDP fell from 2.7 percent during 1960-83 to only 1.6 percent in 1984-2001.,2003-02-03
They attribute 20 to 30 percent of this reduction in volatility to improvements in monetary policy.,2003-02-03
"At the broadest level, globalization influences the conduct of monetary policy through its powerful effects on the economic and financial environment in which monetary policy must operate.",2007-03-02
"As you know, several decades of global economic integration have left a large imprint on the structure of the U.S. economy, including changes in patterns of production, employment, trade, and financial flows.",2007-03-02
"Other than by contributing to general economic and financial stability, monetary policy can do little to affect these structural changes or the powerful economic forces that drive them.",2007-03-02
"However, to make effective policy, the Federal Reserve must have as full an understanding as possible of the factors determining economic growth, employment, and inflation in the U.S. economy, whether those influences originate at home or abroad.",2007-03-02
"A narrower question, but one that is critical for monetary policy makers, is whether the increased openness of the U.S. economy has in some way affected the ability of the Federal Reserve to meet its congressional mandate to foster price stability and maximum sustainable employment.",2007-03-02
"On this issue, some analysts have argued that globalization hinders monetary policy--for example, by reducing the ability of the Federal Reserve to affect U.S. interest rates and asset prices or by diminishing the role of domestic factors in the inflation process.",2007-03-02
You will not be surprised to hear that the Federal Reserve System is quite interested in the implications of globalization for the conduct and effectiveness of monetary policy.,2007-03-02
"The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas has created a Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute, which will support the study of globalizationâ€™s effects on policy and the economy, and a number of other Reserve Banks have undertaken similar efforts.",2007-03-02
In the remainder of my talk I will discuss two channels through which globalization may have affected the transmission and effectiveness of U.S. monetary policy.,2007-03-02
"First, I will consider whether the globalization of finance has weakened or otherwise affected the ability of U.S. monetary policy to influence domestic financial market conditions.",2007-03-02
"Second, I will discuss what we know about the way international factors influence the determination of inflation, a key goal variable for monetary policy.",2007-03-02
"Globalization, Monetary Policy, and Financial MarketsMonetary policy works in the first instance by affecting financial conditions, including the levels of interest rates and asset prices.",2007-03-02
Does financial globalization significantly reduce the influence of the Federal Reserve on financial conditions in the United States and thereby possibly make U.S. monetary policy less effective?,2007-03-02
"Certainly, the financial environment in which U.S. monetary policy is made has been irrevocably changed by the remarkable increases in the magnitudes of financial flows into and out of the United States.",2007-03-02
"Given their scale, capital inflows and outflows certainly influence long-term U.S. interest rates and other key asset prices, both by affecting the underlying supply-demand balance between saving and capital investment and by helping to determine the premiums that investors receive for holding assets that are risky or illiquid.",2007-03-02
How does all this affect monetary policy?,2007-03-02
It is helpful to think about the potential implications of globalized financial markets for monetary policy by beginning with the first stages of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.,2007-03-02
"In particular, as you know, the Federal Reserve influences financial conditions through its ability to control the federal funds rate, the interest rate at which banks lend to each other overnight.",2007-03-02
"Although the federal funds rate does not itself have a major influence on economic activity, other short-term rates--such as Eurodollar rates--are determined largely by the current and expected future values of the funds rate, reflecting the close substitutability of alternative short-term sources of funding.",2007-03-02
"The Federal Reserveâ€™s ability to control the federal funds rate thus gives it a strong influence over other short-term dollar nominal interest rates and, to the extent that inflation is inertial or sticky in the short run, over short-term real interest rates as well.",2007-03-02
"The Fedâ€™s ability to set the short-term interest rate independently of foreign financial conditions depends critically, of course, on the fact that the dollar is a freely floating currency whose value is continuously determined in open, competitive markets.",2007-03-02
"Because the dollar is free to adjust, U.S. interest rates can differ from rates abroad, and, consequently, the Fed retains the autonomy to set its federal funds rate target as needed to respond to domestic economic conditions.",2007-03-02
"Short-term interest rates affect the domestic economy through a number of channels (for example, by affecting the cost of holding inventories), so monetary policy could influence economic activity to some degree even if its control were limited to the short end of the yield curve.",2007-03-02
"Nevertheless, the ability to influence longer-term interest rates and the prices of longer-term assets is an important component of the Fedâ€™s toolkit for managing aggregate demand.",2007-03-02
The behavior of long-term interest rates over the past few years is a case in point.,2007-03-02
"Compared with historical averages, long-term nominal interest rates have remained relatively low in recent years--the phenomenon that the previous Chairman, Alan Greenspan, termed a â€œconundrumâ€--even as the Federal Reserve was withdrawing monetary accommodation by raising the target for the federal funds rate by more than 400 basis points.",2007-03-02
"For example, strong foreign demand for U.S. long-term debt has been one factor tending to reduce the term premium, the extra return that investors demand to hold longer-term bonds.",2007-03-02
"All else equal, a smaller term premium implies a lower level of long-term interest rates.",2007-03-02
"At the same time, increases in the net supply of saving in global capital markets--which, to a significant extent, are a product of the large current account surpluses of some emerging-market economies and of oil-producing nations--have resulted in lower real long-term interest rates both in the United States and abroad.",2007-03-02
"Clearly, to understand and evaluate the behavior of the term structure and to assess the implications of current yields for the domestic economy, the Fed must take into account the various effects of foreign capital flows on U.S. yields and asset prices, a task that can be quite challenging.",2007-03-02
One statistical indicator of that interdependence is that the correlations between long-term interest rates in the United States and those in other industrial countries are high and appear to have risen significantly in the last few years.,2007-03-02
That interdependence suggests that monetary policy makers must pay attention to conditions abroad as well as at home.,2007-03-02
"However, the greater analytical complexity and interdependence associated with the globalization of financial markets notwithstanding, both theory and--perhaps more persuasively--recent experience support the view that the Federal Reserve retains considerable leverage over longer-term rates and key asset prices, although the links from monetary policy decisions to longer-term rates are somewhat looser than those to short-term rates.",2007-03-02
"Because long-term nominal interest rates can be viewed as the sum of a weighted average of expected future short-term nominal interest rates plus a term premium, Federal Reserve policies and communications substantially influence the behavior of these rates.",2007-03-02
"In analogous fashion, the Fedâ€™s ability to influence real interest rates at shorter horizons provides a lever for affecting longer-term real yields.",2007-03-02
"Like nominal long-term yields, real long-term yields can be viewed as an average of current and future expected short-term real rates, so that the effects of monetary policy on shorter-term real yields feed into longer-term yields as well.",2007-03-02
"Well-anchored inflation expectations are also helpful in this regard: If expectations of long-term inflation are stable, then changes in long-term nominal interest rates translate into similar changes in long-term real rates.",2007-03-02
The empirical literature supports the view that U.S. monetary policy retains its ability to influence longer-term rates and other asset prices.,2007-03-02
"Empirical studies also find that U.S. monetary policy actions retain a powerful effect on domestic stock prices.1 If globalization has not constrained the ability of U.S. monetary policy to influence domestic financial conditions, why are long-term interest rates and key asset prices so correlated across economies?",2007-03-02
"Recent research suggests another possibility, which is that U.S. monetary policy actions may have significant effects on foreign yields and asset prices as well as on domestic financial prices.",2007-03-02
"For example, changes in U.S. short-term interest rates seem to exert a substantial influence on euro area bond yields (Ehrmann, Fratzscher, and Rigobon, 2005; Faust and others, 2006) and appear to have a strong effect on foreign equity indexes as well.2 In contrast, the effects of foreign short-term rates on U.S. asset prices appear to be relatively weaker.",2007-03-02
"But, second, globalization has added a dimension of complexity to the analysis of financial conditions and their determinants, which monetary policy makers must take into account.",2007-03-02
"Has Globalization Affected the U.S. Inflation Process?Other than through its influence on financial markets, globalization may also have affected the operation of monetary policy by changing the relative importance of the various factors that determine the domestic inflation rate.3 As national markets become increasingly integrated and open, sellers of goods, services, and labor may face more competition and have less market power than in the past.",2007-03-02
"In particular, prices and wages may depend on economic conditions abroad as well as on conditions in the local market.",2007-03-02
"These linkages suggest that, at least in the short run, globalization and trade may affect the course of domestic inflation.",2007-03-02
International factors might affect domestic inflation through several related channels.,2007-03-02
"First, the expansion of trade may cause domestic inflation to depend to a greater extent on the prices of imported goods--not only because imported goods enter the consumer basket or (in the case of imported intermediate goods) affect the costs of domestic production, but because competition with imports affects the pricing power of domestic producers.",2007-03-02
"Second, competitive pressures engendered by globalization could affect the inflation process by increasing productivity growth, thereby reducing costs, or by reducing markups.",2007-03-02
"Third, to the extent that some prices are set in internationally integrated markets, pressures on resource utilization in foreign economies could be relevant to domestic inflation.4 Some analysts might object to the proposition that globalization affects the inflation process at all on the grounds that the structural changes that globalization engenders can affect only the relative prices of goods and services; in contrast, inflation--the rate of change of the overall price level--must ultimately be determined solely by monetary policy (Ball, 2006).",2007-03-02
"Certainly, monetary policy determines inflation in the long run, and the central bank must take responsibility for the inflation outcomes generated by its policies.",2007-03-02
"For example, the opening of trade with emerging-market economies that have low labor costs may reduce the relative prices of imported manufactures, but if the long-run inflation objective of the central bank is held constant, then the ultimate effect of the lower import prices on inflation will be nil as changes in other prices offset the effect of import prices.",2007-03-02
"However, the conclusion that inflation is determined only by monetary policy choices need not hold in the short-to-medium run.",2007-03-02
"In the shorter term, central banks do not usually offset completely the effects of shocks to supply or prices--of which a change in the relative price of imports is an example--in part because any monetary action made in response will take time to be effective.",2007-03-02
"Consequently, such shocks may affect domestic inflation for a time.",2007-03-02
"More subtly, a central bank following a strategy of â€œopportunistic disinflationâ€ might react to a favorable shock to supply or prices by lowering its medium-term objective for inflation (Orphanides and Wilcox, 2002).",2007-03-02
"In the case of a central bank pursuing such a strategy, foreign factors that depress domestic inflation may have a persistent effect so long as inflation exceeds the central bankâ€™s long-term objective.5 What, then, is the evidence for the view that globalization is affecting the inflation process in the United States?",2007-03-02
"Of the various channels that have been suggested, probably the most intuitive is the idea that greater openness to trade has increased the influence of import prices on domestic inflation.",2007-03-02
"In the major industrial economies over the past decade or so, import prices--particularly the prices of imported manufactured goods--have generally risen at a slower rate than other consumer prices, slowing overall inflation.",2007-03-02
"The slower growth in import prices reflects to some extent rapid productivity gains in the production of manufactures, an important component of trade.6 Increased exports by low-cost emerging-market economies have also helped keep down the prices of imports received by the United States and other industrialized countries.",2007-03-02
"Overall, research indicates that trade with developing economies in particular has slowed the rate of growth of import prices faced by industrialized countries, with estimates of the reduction ranging widely from 1/2 to 2 percentage points.",2007-03-02
"One study, for example, estimated that trade with China alone has reduced annual import price inflation in the United States by about 1 percentage point over the period 1993-2002 (Kamin, Marazzi, and Schindler, 2006)7.",2007-03-02
"However, imported goods make up only part of what people consume, and so the effect on overall inflation is less than the deceleration in the prices of imports alone.",2007-03-02
Typical estimates of the short-term effect on the overall inflation rate of less-rapid increases in the prices of imports stemming from trade with China are in the neighborhood of 0.1 percent or less per year--a discernible but certainly not a large effect.,2007-03-02
"First, the direct effect of lower import prices on overall consumer price inflation could understate the overall effect, if lower import prices force competing domestic firms to restrain their prices as well.",2007-03-02
"Research has generally found that import prices do affect the prices charged by domestic producers.8 For example, the International Monetary Fund found that, in a range of industrial economies, the prices of domestic products were restrained by competition from imports, the effect being larger with greater penetration (IMF, 2006).",2007-03-02
"To the extent that import competition slows the rate of increase of domestic prices, the tendency of lower-cost imports to reduce domestic inflation will be enhanced.",2007-03-02
"On the other hand, not all aspects of globalization and trade reduce inflation.",2007-03-02
"For example, globalization has been associated with strong growth in some large emerging-market economies, notably China and India, and this growth likely has contributed to recent increases in the prices of energy and other commodities.",2007-03-02
"During 2003-05, for example, China alone accounted for nearly one-third of the growth in both global real gross domestic product (GDP) and oil consumption.",2007-03-02
"It is difficult to assess the exact extent to which increased demand by developing countries has contributed to the run-ups in commodity prices in recent years, as these prices are also affected by supply conditions and other factors.",2007-03-02
"However, one study estimated that, if the share of world trade and world GDP enjoyed by non-industrial countries had remained at its 2000 levels, then by 2005 real oil prices would have been as much as 40 percent lower, and real metals prices 10 percent lower, than they actually were (Pain, Koske, and Sollie, 2006).",2007-03-02
"Accordingly, in the past several years, the effect of growth in developing economies on commodity prices has been a source of upward pressure on inflation in the United States and other industrial economies.",2007-03-02
"When the offsetting effects of globalization on the prices of manufactured imports and on energy and commodity prices are considered together, there seems to be little basis for concluding that globalization overall has significantly reduced inflation in the United States in recent years; indeed, the opposite may be true.",2007-03-02
"That said, the integration of rapidly industrializing economies into the global trading system clearly has had important effects on the prices of both manufactures and commodities, reinforcing the need to monitor international influences on the inflation process.",2007-03-02
Globalization also may affect the inflation process through other channels.,2007-03-02
"Some researchers, for example, have suggested greater openness to trade and the resulting increase in competition may have led to reduced markups of price over cost (Chen, Imbs, and Scott, 2004).",2007-03-02
"However, the rise in profit rates in recent years seems inconsistent with the view that markups have declined (Bowman, 2003; Kohn, 2006).9 The competition fostered by trade should also promote productivity growth, reducing growth in costs and making the attainment of low inflation easier.",2007-03-02
"That productivity growth is linked to the intensity of competition is plausible, and more-rapid productivity growth seems to help to explain the slowing of inflation in the United States in the mid-1990s.",2007-03-02
"However, the fact that most other industrial countries did not experience the same increase in productivity growth as the United States during that period, even as they became more open to trade, suggests that the relationship between productivity and trade may be complex.",2007-03-02
"In a globalized economy, the level of resource utilization in the world economy is another potential influence on domestic inflation.",2007-03-02
Standard analyses of inflation based on the concept of a Phillips curve assign a role in inflation determination to the domestic output gap--the difference between the economyâ€™s potential output and its actual production.,2007-03-02
"According to this theory, the existence of slack in the economy makes it more difficult for producers to raise prices and for workers to win higher wages, with the result that inflation slows.",2007-03-02
These conventional analyses have considered only the possible link between domestic inflation and the domestic output gap.,2007-03-02
"But in an increasingly integrated world economy, one may well ask whether a global output gap can be meaningfully defined and measured and, if it can, whether it affects domestic inflation.",2007-03-02
"In other words, all else being equal, would a booming world economy increase the potential for inflationary pressures within the United States?",2007-03-02
"In principle, with the domestic determinants of inflation held constant, reduced slack in the global economy could increase domestic inflation for a time if it led to higher prices for some traded goods and services relative to the prices of goods and services that are not usually traded.",2007-03-02
"For example, suppose that the United States produces personal computers both for export and for domestic use, and that more-rapid growth abroad increases the world demand for computers.",2007-03-02
Stronger global demand for computers raises the prices that U.S. producers can charge their foreign customers.,2007-03-02
"If producers of many goods face increases in worldwide demand, the net effect could be higher inflation in the United States, even though there may be no measurable effect on the prices of U.S. imports.",2007-03-02
"Early work, including some done at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, found no effect of global demand conditions on U.S. inflation, as did most of the subsequent research.10 Recently, however, several researchers affiliated with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) have reported results favorable to the global output gap hypothesis (Borio and Filardo, 2006).",2007-03-02
"Using data for sixteen industrialized countries (plus the euro area) for 1985-2005, they found significant effects of the global output gap on domestic inflation rates--indeed, effects that were generally larger than those of domestic output gaps and that were rising over time.",2007-03-02
A clear resolution of the question of how global economic conditions affect domestic inflation may continue to elude us.,2007-03-02
"Overall, global factors do seem to influence domestic inflation.",2007-03-02
"Most directly, increasing trade with China and other developing countries has led to slower growth in the prices of imported manufactured goods.",2007-03-02
"However, this effect has been offset in the most recent period by the increases in the prices for energy and commodities associated with the rapid growth in these emerging market economies.",2007-03-02
"Other, more indirect channels may exist, including the possibilities that trade promotes productivity growth and thus lower costs and that global demand conditions influence domestic pricing decisions.",2007-03-02
"The second is the set of factors that have recently restrained inflation, despite persistent strong growth and a decline in the unemployment rate to the lowest level in a quarter century.",1998-01-08
"The strength of the cyclical upswing kept monetary policy alert, but -- given the quiescence of inflation -- mostly on hold, during the last year.",1998-01-08
"The continued robustness of the expansion into the fourth quarter, including further tightening of the labor market in October and November, might, in my judgment, have tilted the balance toward the case for additional monetary restraint, notwithstanding the continued excellent inflation readings.",1998-01-08
"It has reinforced prospects for some spontaneous slowing of the economy, introduced a downside risk that had not previously been an important consideration in policy deliberations, and added an additional restraining force on inflation immediately ahead.",1998-01-08
"The task of the Federal Reserve in the coming year will be importantly shaped by the magnitude of the downdraft from the Asian crisis, how it interacts with the remaining cyclical strength in domestic demand, and the degree to which its effects on import and commodity prices help keep inflation in check.",1998-01-08
"But before I return to the prospects for 1998 and the challenges for monetary policy, I will offer a retrospective on 1997.",1998-01-08
"Let me emphasize that the views I present this afternoon, both about the outlook and about monetary policy, are my own views and should not be interpreted as the views of the FOMC.",1998-01-08
The most dramatic feature of the 1997 macro experience was clearly the combination of faster-than-expected growth and lower-than-expected inflation.,1998-01-08
"Growth over 1997 probably exceeded 3 ½% from the fourth quarter of 1996 through the fourth quarter of 1997, while inflation, measured by the CPI, was only about 2% over the same period.",1998-01-08
"In February of 1997, for example, the Blue Chip consensus forecast projected just 2% growth in GDP over 1997 and a 3% increase in the CPI.",1998-01-08
"I would characterize the pace of output growth over 1997 as unsustainable, meaning that it was faster than the expansion of productive capacity and would ultimately be restrained going forward either by physical capacity constraints or by higher utilization rates, higher inflation, and policy tightening.",1998-01-08
"The unemployment rate declined by about ¾ percentage point this past year, consistent with the observation that growth was above trend.",1998-01-08
Most estimates would put the actual unemployment rate at the end of the year perhaps ¾ percentage point below the NAIRU.,1998-01-08
"But we clearly have not faced the usual consequence of over-taxing capacity constraints-- namely, an acceleration in prices.",1998-01-08
"While wage gains did increase, albeit very modestly, over the year, inflation remained extraordinarily well contained.",1998-01-08
"The analogy is to an economy where growth is neither too fast nor too slow, allowing a comfortable and peaceful expansion without inflationary overtones.",1998-01-08
"In economic terms, Goldilocks should be a story about a ""soft landing,"" a situation where growth slows to trend just as the economy reaches full employment and inflation stabilizes at a satisfactory level.",1998-01-08
"But growth over 1997 did not slow to trend, and, as a result, the unemployment rate declined to a level where overheating would normally be evident.",1998-01-08
Yet we did not get the increase in inflation.,1998-01-08
"The overall forecast errors for output growth and inflation, in such a model, can be described in terms of some combination of errors made by the model's equations and incorrect assumptions about variables imposed judgmentally on the forecast.",1998-01-08
"Or, the assumed path for oil and food prices might have turned out to be incorrect.",1998-01-08
"It is a story of a coincidence of favorable surprises, one set yielding stronger-than-expected growth and another set restraining inflation.",1998-01-08
"And, indeed, it may lean the forecast for 1998 toward slower growth and higher inflation, if one cannot identify another sequence of similarly fortunate shocks going forward.",1998-01-08
"Nearly every major component of aggregate demand came in stronger than fundamentals (i.e., the model equations) would have justified.",1998-01-08
Unexpected demand shocks are typically amplified by what is commonly referred to as the muliplier-accelerator process.,1998-01-08
"That is, an unexpected demand shock results in higher output and income, which, in turn, further boosts consumption and investment, reinforcing the effect of the errors on income and output.",1998-01-08
This is also part of the story of faster-than-expected output growth in 1997.,1998-01-08
"But unexpected strength in aggregate demand is usually damped by more restrictive financial conditions, by some combination of monetary tightening and movements in longer-term interest rates.",1998-01-08
"Real long-term interest rates, measured using surveys of inflation expectations, were steady to declining over the year, likely reflecting a smaller-than-anticipated budget deficit and an unwinding of expectations of tighter monetary policy.",1998-01-08
"Nominal rates matter, too, especially for housing, and longer-term nominal rates fell, due to the lower-than-expected inflation.",1998-01-08
"Equity prices unexpectedly soared, reinforcing the strength of both consumption and investment.",1998-01-08
"So, instead of financial conditions dampening the demand shocks, as would normally be the case, more supportive financial conditions actually reinforced them.",1998-01-08
"Financial conditions remained supportive partly because the better-than-expected inflation outcome kept the Fed from raising the federal funds rate, except for the single ¼ percentage point move in March.",1998-01-08
"The decline in inflation, in turn, reflected reinforcing effects of a sharp decline in energy prices, a significant slowing in the increase in food prices, and a further decline in core inflation.",1998-01-08
Overall CPI inflation was widely expected to slow because of a projected reversal of the sharp rise in oil prices over 1996.,1998-01-08
"About one percentage point of the slowing of overall CPI inflation over 1997 was, in fact, due to the relative movements of food and energy prices over 1996 and 1997.",1998-01-08
This was a somewhat sharper effect than was anticipated at the beginning of the year and accounts for a small part of the forecast error on inflation.,1998-01-08
But the greater surprise was the decline in core inflation.,1998-01-08
A major source of this error was the unexpected further appreciation of the dollar and thus the renewed decline in import prices.,1998-01-08
Continuing sharp declines in computer prices and the failure of medical benefit costs to rebound also contributed to the surprisingly favorable inflation outcome.,1998-01-08
There was upward pressure on wage change from the low and declining unemployment rate and from the increases in the minimum wage.,1998-01-08
But this was moderated by the effect on wage change of lower price inflation.,1998-01-08
"There was also a sharp acceleration in productivity over 1997, which held down unit labor costs.",1998-01-08
"In my view, most of this acceleration in productivity was cyclical, meaning it was in response to the faster pace of output growth.",1998-01-08
"Cyclical increases in productivity mainly, in my view, result in higher profits, rather than lower prices.",1998-01-08
"But, there likely was some small moderating influence on inflation from such a cyclical increase in productivity.",1998-01-08
"Putting the story together, the stronger-than-expected growth is explained by unexpected strength in aggregate demand, reinforced by more supportive financial conditions.",1998-01-08
"The excellent inflation outcome, in turn, is explained principally by a coincidence of favorable supply shocks.",1998-01-08
"A second story that could also explain the 1997 pattern of faster-than-expected growth and lower-than-expected inflation is a structural change or a series of structural changes that ushered in a new era of faster economic growth, perhaps lower average unemployment rates, and lower inflation.",1998-01-08
"I will focus specifically on the possibility of an increase in trend productivity growth, allowing faster output growth and, at least temporarily, slower inflation at the same time.",1998-01-08
"In this story, part or all of the faster economic growth over 1997 is matched by faster growth in productive capacity, so it does not have inflationary consequences.",1998-01-08
"In addition, if the increase in the productivity trend is unexpected, it will generally result in lower inflation for a while, as wage gains, based on the previous trend of productivity, are more than outpaced by the faster increase in productivity, lowering unit labor costs and hence inflation.",1998-01-08
"This allows, in principle, faster real growth, lower unemployment rates, and lower inflation.",1998-01-08
"An increase in the productivity trend, by raising the profitability of investment, also is consistent with an investment boom, strong corporate profits, and soaring equity prices.",1998-01-08
"From my perspective, however, I do not see clear evidence of a break in the productivity trend in the data.",1998-01-08
"As I noted earlier, I view the acceleration in productivity over 1997 as a normal cyclical phenomenon.",1998-01-08
There was some surprise about how low productivity growth was during 1994 through 1996.,1998-01-08
But now the level of productivity has returned to where it would be expected to be in light of the cyclical rebound in output.,1998-01-08
Lessons and Questions What are some of the lessons and lingering questions arising from the growth and inflation outcomes last year?,1998-01-08
"Second, the excellent price performance in 1997, in the context of the surprise of a higher dollar and the resulting sharper-than-expected decline in import prices, suggests to me that we might be underestimating the effect of import prices on overall inflation.",1998-01-08
"Many models, in particular, ignore the role of falling import prices in undermining the pricing power of producers of import-competing goods.",1998-01-08
"Third, the pattern of wage change and inflation did not definitively reject the estimates of NAIRU and trend growth that underpinned my forecast; but neither did the outcome entirely reinforce my confidence in them.",1998-01-08
"The poor forecast of inflation was not principally due, in my judgment, to errors in the wage and price equations.",1998-01-08
"Nevertheless, I would have made smaller forecast errors if I had used an estimate of NAIRU a bit below my current estimate of 5 ½% and would have made a smaller error forecasting inflation if I had used a slightly higher estimate of trend growth.",1998-01-08
"Fourth, I wonder whether the divergent pattern in unemployment and capacity utilization rates contributed to the lower-than-expected inflation last year.",1998-01-08
"Traditionally, these two measures of excess demand move together over the cycle.",1998-01-08
"The capacity utilization rate for manufacturing barely budged over 1997, remaining slightly below the point at which it has traditionally been accompanied by an increase in inflation.",1998-01-08
"If the historical relationship between unemployment and capacity utilization had been operative in this expansion, the capacity utilization rate would be more than two percentage points higher today.",1998-01-08
The failure of capacity utilization rates to move into a range that typically is associated with upward pressure on inflation likely has much to do with the perception of an absence of pricing power by firms.,1998-01-08
"It also may have encouraged firms to alter the way they operate in labor markets, encouraging them to avoid increases in wages that they were going to have difficulty passing along in higher prices.",1998-01-08
The net result is that there may be less inflation pressure than would normally be associated with the current rate of unemployment.,1998-01-08
"Prospects for 1998 Economic growth is likely to slow over 1998 and inflation may rise somewhat, but remain modest.",1998-01-08
"However, a slowing in growth appears to be a higher probability than an increase in inflation.",1998-01-08
"The economy ended 1997 with still very positive fundamentals, notwithstanding some apparent weakness in demand in the fourth quarter.",1998-01-08
"Momentum in income growth, a high level of wealth, a record level of consumer confidence, lower mortgage rates, and ready availability of jobs support the household sector.",1998-01-08
Inflation is low.,1998-01-08
It is from this base that growth is expected to slow over 1998 as a result of the combined effect of some spontaneous slowdown and the spillover from the Asian crisis.,1998-01-08
"The slowdown should move growth closer to a sustainable rate, rather than threaten recession.",1998-01-08
A key for monetary policy will be whether growth slows to or below trend or remains above trend.,1998-01-08
"This, in turn, will be an important consideration in the inflation outcome next year and risks of higher inflation thereafter, and will, for me, be an important consideration in the decision about monetary policy.",1998-01-08
"A Slowdown in Growth An important rationale for a spontaneous slowing -- that is, one occurring without further Fed tightening -- is that the pattern of consistent upside surprises across aggregate demand components over 1997 is unlikely to be repeated.",1998-01-08
"In this case, the explanation for the faster-than-expected growth over 1997 provides a rationale for a slowdown over 1998.",1998-01-08
GDP growth appears likely to have exceeded 3% again in the fourth quarter.,1998-01-08
"The production side data -- employment, hours worked, and industrial production -- certainly seem to point to solid growth, but the available data on demand components have been on the weak side.",1998-01-08
The spillover effects from the Asian turmoil should further slow growth over 1998.,1998-01-08
The degree of slowing in growth and the size of the depreciation in the exchange rates in the region still will be affected by policy actions to be taken by those authorities and the uncertain timing of any improvement in investor confidence.,1998-01-08
"As a result, developments in Asia clearly add a considerable degree of uncertainty to the outlook, though around a forecast of slower growth and lower inflation than would otherwise have been the case.",1998-01-08
"At this point, I expect, the direct effect of the shock from Asian developments on U.S. net exports would slow the growth in our GDP by roughly ½ percentage point.",1998-01-08
"Crosscurrents on Inflation Looking ahead, powerful crosscurrents should still be operating on inflation.",1998-01-08
"Second, the decline in inflation over the last year should be an important moderating force on wage change going forward, partially offsetting the first factor.",1998-01-08
"Third, the set of forces that have restrained inflation over the last year, the factors I have referred to as favorable supply shocks, will continue to restrain inflation.",1998-01-08
The unemployment rate is well below most estimates of NAIRU.,1998-01-08
"The resulting upward pressure on wage change and price inflation can be offset or even overwhelmed at times, as it was last year, by other influences.",1998-01-08
"Nevertheless, the role of this consideration in inflation dynamics should not be overlooked or underestimated.",1998-01-08
It starts me with a bias toward higher inflation.,1998-01-08
The question is then whether there will be enough offsetting influences in 1998 to prevent inflation from rising.,1998-01-08
One such offset is the virtuous cycle set in motion by the lower inflation in 1997.,1998-01-08
The lower inflation last year should moderate the cyclical pressure for higher nominal wages over 1998.,1998-01-08
"That is, the real wage increases produced by the lower inflation substitute for nominal wage gains that would otherwise have been required to achieve the higher path of real wages.",1998-01-08
"The pattern in food, energy, computer, and import prices and in benefit costs will again be important factors shaping the inflation outlook this year.",1998-01-08
The movements in these prices are not closely tied to the balance of supply and demand in overall labor and product markets and are often subject to wide swings and rapid reversals.,1998-01-08
"Forecasts of these prices are, as a result, often wide of the mark.",1998-01-08
"It appears that energy, import, and, of course, computer prices will decline again over 1998 and food prices increases will again be modest.",1998-01-08
"While there is likely to be at least a modest rebound in benefit costs, we should add to the list of factors restraining measured inflation the one to two tenths decline in CPI inflation associated with technical revisions to be introduced by the BLS this month.",1998-01-08
The restraint likely from favorable supply shocks this year has recently been reinforced by a further decline in crude petroleum prices and the projected effect of the Asian crisis on import prices.,1998-01-08
"On balance, it now appears that these forces will continue to restrain inflation over 1998 perhaps by about as much as was the case over 1997.",1998-01-08
"In this case, favorable supply shocks would be neutral factor on inflation this year, neither contributing to higher or lower inflation.",1998-01-08
"On balance, I expect a small increase in inflation in 1998.",1998-01-08
"The upward pressure on inflation will also depend on what happens to utilization rates over the year, which in turn will depend on precisely how much growth slows.",1998-01-08
One final influence is the sharp cyclical slowing in productivity I expect.,1998-01-08
This will raise unit labor costs and mainly undermine profit growth.,1998-01-08
But it could put some upward pressure on prices as well.,1998-01-08
"Two Scenarios and the Challenges Facing Monetary Policy There are many possible outcomes, particularly given the uncertainty about the degree of spontaneous slowing and the dimensions of the spillover from the Asian crisis.",1998-01-08
"Because upside and downside risks for growth and inflation appear to be more balanced than had been the case earlier, I believe monetary policy also needs to be in a more balanced position.",1998-01-08
"The course of monetary policy will, of course, depend on how much growth slows, what happens to utilization rates, and how the movement in utilization rates interacts with the other crosscurrents affecting inflation.",1998-01-08
"Continued above-trend growth and a further rise utilization rates, on the other hand, could encourage further tightening.",1998-01-08
"But I want to focus on two intermediate outcomes, both because I view these as more likely and because they would raise more interesting questions for monetary policy.",1998-01-08
"As I noted earlier, in a soft landing, growth slows from an above-trend to trend rate just as output converges from below to its full employment level.",1998-01-08
But I believe output is already beyond the full employment level.,1998-01-08
A soft landing in this case requires growth to run below trend for a period to allow productive capacity to catch up to demand and to allow utilization rates to ease to sustainable levels.,1998-01-08
"Ordinarily, inflation would be rising during the transition, given initial conditions of output in excess of sustainable capacity.",1998-01-08
"But, in the current episode, the virtuous cycle in play and renewal of forces that have recently been restraining inflation will continue to damp inflation over 1998, at least moderating the rise in inflation that would otherwise occur.",1998-01-08
"In this scenario, real growth slows to around 2% or slightly lower, the unemployment rate edges upward, but remains below NAIRU over 1998, and inflation is slightly higher.",1998-01-08
"This is a path back toward full employment, leaving inflation higher but still modest once full employment is reached, perhaps by the end of 1999.",1998-01-08
How should monetary policy respond in this scenario?,1998-01-08
Should policy ease in response to the sharp slowing in growth and rise in the unemployment rate?,1998-01-08
"Or should policy remain on hold, allowing the economy to converge slowly back to full employment and a still modest inflation rate?",1998-01-08
"Given the momentum in domestic demand, the still favorable financial conditions and other fundamentals, questions about the degree of spontaneous slowing, and uncertainty about the magnitude of the spillover from the Asian crisis, an equally plausible forecast is that growth slows, but only to trend.",1998-01-08
"In this case, the unemployment rate would remain near its current level and inflation would increase slightly more than in the first scenario, though it would still be damped in 1998 by the virtuous cycle forces and the continued favorable supply shocks.",1998-01-08
"This scenario would, however, imply greater inflation risks going forward, in light of prospects that the favorable supply shocks eventually will abate, while the prevailing high labor utilization rate will continue to push wage gains higher.",1998-01-08
How should monetary policy respond in this case?,1998-01-08
"Should policy remain on hold, given the return to a sustainable rate of growth and stable utilization rates?",1998-01-08
"Or, should there be a tightening of policy in light of the prospects for a gradual but persistent updrift in inflation associated with the still very high utilization rates?",1998-01-08
"The latter scenario is valuable in highlighting that the risks of higher inflation are related to the level of utilization rates, not to the rate of growth of output itself.",1998-01-08
"The point is that even if growth slows to trend, utilization rates could be left at unsustainable levels, leaving a risk of rising inflation over time.",1998-01-08
"We also face the common challenge of excessive inflation, which is no coincidence, since Germany and other countries are dealing with many of the same forces driving up inflation in the United States.",2022-05-30
"We see that in the deepening and possible broadening of our security commitments, and we also see it in the strong commitment that central banks in Europe and elsewhere have made to fight inflation.",2022-05-30
"First, I will provide my outlook for the U.S. economy and how the Federal Reserve plans to reduce inflation and achieve our 2 percent target.",2022-05-30
Then I will pivot to a more academic discussion of the labor market and the possibility of a soft landing in which taming inflation does not harm employment.,2022-05-30
"Despite a pause early this year in the growth of real gross domestic product (GDP), the U.S. economy continues to power along at a healthy pace.",2022-05-30
"Consumer spending and business investment, which are the bedrock of GDP, were both strong, and more recent data point toward solid demand and continuing momentum in the economy that will sustain output growth in the months ahead.",2022-05-30
"Unemployment is near a 50-year low, and both the low numbers of people filing for unemployment benefits and the high number of job openings indicate that the slowdown in the economy from the fast pace of last year isn't yet weighing on the job market.",2022-05-30
"As I will explain, this very tight labor market has implications for inflation and the Fed's plans for reducing inflation.",2022-05-30
"But on its own terms, we need to recognize that robust job creation is an underlying strength of the U.S. economy, which is expanding its productive capacity and supporting personal income and ongoing economic growth, in the face of other challenges.",2022-05-30
"Let me turn now to the outlook for the Fed's top priority, inflation.",2022-05-30
"I said in December that inflation was alarmingly high, and it has remained so.",2022-05-30
The April consumer price index (CPI) was up 8.3 percent year over year.,2022-05-30
This headline number was a slight decline from 8.5 percent in March but primarily due to a drop in volatile gasoline prices that we know surged again this month.,2022-05-30
"Twelve-month ""core"" inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, was also down slightly to 6.2 percent in April, from 6.5 percent the month before, but the 0.6 percent monthly increase from March was an acceleration from the February to March rate and still too high.",2022-05-30
"Meanwhile, the Fed's preferred measure based on personal consumption expenditures (PCE) recorded headline inflation of 6.3 percent and core of 4.9 percent.",2022-05-30
"No matter which measure is considered, however, headline inflation has come in above 4 percent for about a year and core inflation is not coming down enough to meet the Fed's target anytime soon.",2022-05-30
"Inflation this high affects everyone but is especially painful for lower- and middle-income households that spend a large share of their income on shelter, groceries, gasoline, and other necessities.",2022-05-30
"It is the FOMC's job to meet our price stability mandate and get inflation down, and we are determined to do so.",2022-05-30
The forces driving inflation today are the same ones that emerged a year ago.,2022-05-30
The combination of strong consumer demand and supply constraintsâ€”both bottlenecks and a shortage of workers relative to labor demandâ€”is generating very high inflation.,2022-05-30
"We can argue about whether supply or demand is a greater factor, but the details have no bearing on the fact that we are not meeting the FOMC's price stability mandate.",2022-05-30
What I care about is getting inflation down so that we avoid a lasting escalation in the public's expectations of future inflation.,2022-05-30
"Once inflation expectations become unanchored in this way, it is very difficult and economically painful to lower them.",2022-05-30
"While it is not surprising that inflation expectations for the next year are up, since current inflation is high, what I focus on is longer-term inflation expectations.",2022-05-30
"Overall, my assessment is that longer-range inflation expectations have moved up from a level that was consistent with trend inflation below 2 percent to a level that's consistent with underlying inflation a little above 2 percent.",2022-05-30
"I will be watching that these expectations do not continue to rise because longer-term inflation expectations influence near term inflation, as well as our ability to achieve our 2 percent target.",2022-05-30
"When they are anchored, they influence spending decisions today in a way that helps inflation move toward our target.",2022-05-30
"To ensure these longer-term expectations do not move up broadly, the Federal Reserve has tools to reduce demand, which should ease inflation pressures.",2022-05-30
"And, over time, supply constraints will resolve to help rein in price increases as well, although we don't know how soon.",2022-05-30
I cannot emphasize enough that my FOMC colleagues and I are united in our commitment to do what it takes to bring inflation down and achieve the Fed's 2 percent target.,2022-05-30
"In particular, I am not taking 50 basis-point hikes off the table until I see inflation coming down closer to our 2 percent target.",2022-05-30
"And, by the end of this year, I support having the policy rate at a level above neutral so that it is reducing demand for products and labor, bringing it more in line with supply and thus helping rein in inflation.",2022-05-30
"In the next couple of weeks, for example, the May employment and CPI reports will be released.",2022-05-30
Those are two key pieces of data I will be watching to get information about the continuing strength of the labor market and about the momentum in price increases.,2022-05-30
"Over a longer period, we will learn more about how monetary policy is affecting demand and how supply constraints are evolving.",2022-05-30
"If the data suggest that inflation is stubbornly high, I am prepared to do more.",2022-05-30
"This expectation represents a significant degree of policy tightening, consistent with the FOMC's commitment to get inflation back under control and, if we need to do more, we will.",2022-05-30
Higher rates make it more expensive to finance spending and investment which should help reduce demand and contribute to lower inflation.,2022-05-30
"In addition to raising rates, the FOMC further tightened monetary policy by ending asset purchases in March and then agreeing to start reducing our holdings of securities, a process that begins June 1.",2022-05-30
All these actions have the goal of bringing inflation down toward the FOMC's 2 percent target.,2022-05-30
Increased rates and a smaller balance sheet raise the cost of borrowing and thus reduce household and business demand.,2022-05-30
"On top of this, I also hope that over time supply problems resolve and help lower inflation.",2022-05-30
"The United States is not alone in facing excessive inflation, and other central banks also are responding.",2022-05-30
"In the euro area, headline inflation continued to edge up in April, to 7.5 percent, while its version of core inflation increased from 2.9 percent to 3.5 percent.",2022-05-30
"Based on this broadening of price pressures, communication by the European Central Bank (ECB) is widely interpreted as signaling that it will likely start raising its policy rate this summer and that it could raise rates a few times before year-end.",2022-05-30
"Policy tightening started last year, as emerging markets including Mexico and Brazil increased rates substantially amid expectations of accelerating inflation.",2022-05-30
"Several advanced-economy central banks, including the Bank of England, began raising interest rates in the second half of last year.",2022-05-30
"This worldwide increase in policy rates, unfortunately, reflects the fact that ­high inflation is a global problem, which central banks around the world recognize must be addressed.",2022-05-30
Some have expressed concern that the Fed cannot raise interest rates to arrest inflation while also avoiding a sharp slowdown in economic growth and significant damage to the labor market.,2022-05-30
"One argument in this regard warns that policy tightening will reduce the current high level of job vacancies and push up unemployment substantially, based on the historical relationship between these two pieces of data, which is depicted by something called the Beveridge curve.",2022-05-30
The relationship between vacancies and the unemployment rate is shown in slide 4.,2022-05-30
The blue dots in the figure show observations of the vacancy rate and the unemployment rate between 2000 and 2018.,2022-05-30
The black curve is the fitted relationship between the log of vacancies and the log of unemployment over this period.,2022-05-30
"From this, the argument goes, policy to slow demand and push down vacancies requires moving along this curve and increasing the unemployment rate substantially.",2022-05-30
"But there's another perspective about what a reduction in vacancies implies for unemployment that is just as plausible, if not more so.",2022-05-30
"These two dots suggest that the vacancy rate can be reduced substantially, from the current level to the January 2019 level, while still leaving the level of vacancies consistent with a strong labor market and with a low level of unemployment, such as we had in 2019.",2022-05-30
"To see why this is a plausible outcome, I first need to digress a bit to discuss the important determinants of unemployment.",2022-05-30
"Many factors influence the unemployment rate, and vacancies are just one.",2022-05-30
"Thus, to understand how a lower vacancy rate would influence unemployment going forward, we need to separate the direct effect of vacancies on the unemployment rate from other factors.",2022-05-30
"To do that, we first need to review the factors that account for unemployment movements.",2022-05-30
"There are two broad determinants of unemployment: separations from employment (including layoffs and quits), which raise unemployment, and job finding by the unemployed, which lowers unemployment.2 Separations consist largely of layoffs, which are typically cyclical, surging in recessions and falling during booms.",2022-05-30
"To see how separations and job finding affect the unemployment rate, it's helpful to start with equation (1) on slide 6, which states that in a steady state (that is, when the unemployment rate is constant), flows into unemployment, the left side of equation (1), must equal flows out of unemployment, the right side.",2022-05-30
"Flows into unemployment equal the separations rate, $$s$$, times the level of employment.",2022-05-30
"For simplicity, I've normalized the labor force to 1, so that employment equals 1 minus unemployment, $$U$$.",2022-05-30
"Flows out of unemployment, the right side of the equation, equal the rate of job finding, $$f$$, times the number of unemployed.",2022-05-30
"Rearranging this equation yields an expression for the steady-state unemployment rate, equation (2).3 Because flows into and out of unemployment are quite high, the actual unemployment rate converges to the steady-state unemployment rate quickly, and the steady-state unemployment rate typically tracks the actual rate closely.4 So, going forward, I'm going to think of the steady-state unemployment rate as a good approximation of the actual unemployment rate.",2022-05-30
"If we divide both sides of equation (3) by unemployment, we get equation (4), which expresses the job-finding rate as a function of the ratio of vacancies to unemployment, or labor market tightness.",2022-05-30
"On the one hand, if the workers searching for jobs are well suited for the jobs that are available, matching efficiency will be high; on the other hand, if many searching workers are not well suited for the available jobs, matching efficiency will be low.6 The last step is to plug our expression for job finding into equation (2), the steady-state unemployment rate, yielding equation (5).",2022-05-30
Equation (5) shows how vacancies affect the unemployment rate.,2022-05-30
"That is, I pick a separation rate at some level and trace out what happens to the unemployment rate as the vacancy rate changes.",2022-05-30
Then I pick a different separation rate and again trace out the effect of vacancies on unemployment.,2022-05-30
"The result is shown on slide 8, which plots four curves showing the effect of vacancies on unemployment for four different separation rates.",2022-05-30
"Because more vacancies generate fewer and fewer hires, they result in smaller and smaller reductions in unemployment.",2022-05-30
"But large numbers of vacancies are, of course, a hallmark of tight labor markets and additional vacancies continue to strongly boost wage growth and quits.",2022-05-30
"You can see that when the separations rate is this high, the unemployment rate is also going to be high, no matter the level of vacancies.",2022-05-30
"At the same time, greater labor demand increases vacancies, causing the labor market to move up the steep curves.",2022-05-30
"As you recall, the black curve fits the actual observations on unemployment and vacancies we saw before the pandemic.",2022-05-30
And we now can see that these observations are produced by a combination of changes in vacancies and separations (as well as other influences on unemployment).,2022-05-30
"Decreases in the separations rate reduce the unemployment rate without changing vacancies, imparting a flatness to the fitted curve relative to the steeper curves that only reflect the effect of vacancies.",2022-05-30
"What does all this suggest about what will happen to the labor market when, as I expect, a tightening of financial conditions and fading fiscal stimulus start to cool labor demand?",2022-05-30
"Slide 10 focuses on the Beveridge curve (the relationship produced by the direct effect of changes in vacancies on unemployment) when the separations rate is low, as it is now.7 The March 2022 observation lies at the top of the curve and is labeled point A.",2022-05-30
"If there is cooling in aggregate demand spurred by monetary policy tightening that tempers labor demand, then vacancies should fall substantially.",2022-05-30
"Then we should travel down the curve from point A to point B.8 The unemployment rate will increase, but only somewhat because labor demand is still strongâ€”just not as strongâ€”and because when the labor market is very tight, as it is now, vacancies generate relatively few hires.",2022-05-30
"Thus, reducing vacancies from an extremely high level to a lower (but still strong) level has a relatively limited effect on hiring and on unemployment.",2022-05-30
"Now, I also show the January 2019 observation of vacancies and unemployment.",2022-05-30
"As you can see, moving from the March 2022 observation to the January 2019 observation is not that different from the change in the unemployment rate predicted by my estimated Beveridge curve, which suggests the predicted small increase in unemployment is a plausible outcome to policy tightening.",2022-05-30
"If labor demand cools, will separations increase and shift the curve outward, increasing unemployment further?",2022-05-30
"Instead, changes in labor demand appear to be reflected primarily in changes in vacancies.",2022-05-30
"Now, it's certainly possible, even probable, that influences on the unemployment rate other than vacancies will change going forward.",2022-05-30
"Thus, I'm not arguing that the unemployment rate will end up exactly as the Beveridge curve I've drawn suggests.",2022-05-30
But I do think it quite plausible that the unemployment rate will end up in the vicinity of what the Beveridge curve currently predicts.,2022-05-30
"Another consideration is that non-linear dynamics could take hold if the unemployment rate increases by a certain amount, as suggested by the Sahm rule, which holds that recessions have in the past occurred whenever the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate rises 0.5 percentage point over its minimum rate over the previous 12 months.9 We certainly need to be alert to this possibility, but the past is not always prescriptive of the future.",2022-05-30
"To sum up, the relationship between vacancies and unemployment gives me reason to hope that policy tightening in current circumstances can tame inflation without causing a sharp increase in unemployment.",2022-05-30
"From this discussion, I am left optimistic that the strong labor market can handle higher rates without a significant increase in unemployment.",2022-05-30
"I shall endeavor to place this most unusual phenomenon in the context of the broader changes in our economy and, hopefully, explain why the value of education, especially to enhance advanced skills, is so vital to the future growth of our economy.",1997-09-12
"Assisted by the whole array of market prices, entrepreneurs seek to identify the types of products and services that individuals will value, especially the added value placed on products and services that customers find better tailored to their particular needs, delivered in shorter time frames, or improved in quality.",1997-09-12
"Indeed, over the past century, by far the smallest part of the growth in America's real gross domestic product reflects increased physical product measured in bulk or weight.",1997-09-12
These developments are affecting how we produce output and are demanding greater specialized knowledge.,1997-09-12
"In this environment, America's prospects for economic growth will greatly depend on our capacity to develop and to apply new technology--a quest that inevitably will entail some risk-taking.",1997-09-12
"The growth of high-tech industry here in the Research Triangle, as well as in Silicon Valley and Boston--all areas rich in educational and research institutions--is no accident.",1997-09-12
"But in the shorter run, we must also develop strategies to overcome the education deficiencies of all too many of our young people, and to renew the skills of workers who have not kept up with the changing demands of the workplace.",1997-09-12
"That is an open-ended topic, and I thought it might be useful to focus on one factor that has been critical in making policy since the mid-1990s--the behavior of productivity.",2003-09-24
It was about that time that the underlying growth of labor productivity turned up.,2003-09-24
"And productivity has risen even more rapidly over the past few years, when the economy has been through recession and modest recovery.",2003-09-24
"Indeed, in the second quarter of this year nonfarm business productivity increased at an astounding 6-3/4 percent rate.",2003-09-24
My focus will not be on the reasons for the changed behavior of productivity--though they will inevitably be an important part of the story.,2003-09-24
"Instead, I thought I would concentrate on one aspect of the acceleration of productivity: its consequences for aggregate demand.",2003-09-24
"That relationship is of obvious interest to monetary policymakers, who are constantly assessing the balance of aggregate demand and potential supply as we pursue our legislated goals of maximum employment and stable prices.",2003-09-24
Movements in potential GDP affect how interest rates and aggregate demand relate in product-market equilibrium--and not in entirely straightforward ways.,2003-09-24
The topic seems particularly timely now in light of the behavior of productivity over the most recent business cycle.,2003-09-24
We can all agree that faster productivity growth benefits U.S. residents over the long-run; it is the foundation for rising standards of living.,2003-09-24
"In the late 1990s, the pickup in productivity fueled a powerful surge in output that resulted in a drop in the unemployment rate.",2003-09-24
"Eventually, a rise in interest rates was required to align aggregate demand with potential output to avoid a pickup in inflation.",2003-09-24
"More recently, rapid productivity growth has been associated with the ""jobless recovery"" and a period of unusually low interest rates to stimulate aggregate demand.",2003-09-24
"And, I stress, they are my thoughts and do not necessarily reflect the views of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or its staff.1 We will really know the answers only ex post, after the final chapter is written on the current business cycle and after numerous data revisions provide us with a better fix on the behavior of productivity.",2003-09-24
"Productivity and Monetary Policy: The Theory In standard models, at a given real interest rate, a sustained increase in the growth rate of productivity should boost demand even more than it does potential supply in the long run.",2003-09-24
"Or, to put the same thing another way--market interest rates eventually must rise after an upturn in productivity growth to equate demand and supply.",2003-09-24
The extra pressure on demand comes from several sources once the long-run growth of supply notches higher and is recognized by economic agents.,2003-09-24
"To keep the growth of the capital stock in line with the now-elevated growth of output, investment needs to rise substantially.",2003-09-24
"Consumption also should rise relative to income because workers revise up their expectations of permanent income and, unless interest rates do rise promptly, because wealth tends to move higher with the increase in the expected rate of growth of profits and dividends.",2003-09-24
"In the short run, whether demand exceeds or falls short of potential supply and whether interest rates need to rise are ambiguous.",2003-09-24
"The answer will depend on such factors as how quickly households revise up their expectations of permanent income and whether the increase in productivity itself requires higher investment for it to be realized--for example, whether it flows from new technology necessarily embodied in new capital equipment.",2003-09-24
"Indeed, if the recognition of these developments by households lags considerably and if growth in the capital stock need not pick up right away, interest rates might even have to fall for a time to boost demand to the higher level of potential.",2003-09-24
This short-run ambiguity presents a challenge to monetary policy.,2003-09-24
"Because of the lags in the response of the economy, policymakers must not only analyze the existing situation but also form a judgment about how demand and supply are likely to evolve over the next several years.",2003-09-24
The Late 1990s It took some time to recognize the upturn in productivity growth in the late 1990s and to understand the effects it was having on the economy.,2003-09-24
"What we observed was very strong growth in output accompanied by a decline in the unemployment rate, but that decline was smaller than would have been anticipated based on previous estimates of the rate of increase in the economy's potential.",2003-09-24
"We also saw that the response of prices to the drop in the unemployment rate was considerably more damped than might have been expected given historical relationships; in fact, some measures of inflation decreased in circumstances in which previous statistical regularities suggested that they ought to have been moving higher.",2003-09-24
"Of course many things were going on at the time, but one hypothetical change that seemed to solve a number of these puzzles was a rise in the trend rate of productivity growth.",2003-09-24
It explained the slow pace of the drop in the unemployment rate.,2003-09-24
"Moreover, it made the behavior of inflation more understandable because the productivity gains seemed to take a while to feed through to higher growth of labor compensation in labor markets and thus lowered business costs initially.",2003-09-24
"As indicated by the drop in the unemployment rate, the response of demand was rapid and strong and exceeded the pickup in supply.",2003-09-24
Steep decreases in the prices of high-tech equipment contributed to a boom in investment as companies acquired new capital equipment to make use of new technology.,2003-09-24
Consumption was boosted by a rising stock market when investors built in higher growth of expected corporate earnings as well as by upward revisions to permanent incomes.,2003-09-24
"Moreover, a portion of the pickup in demand was deflected to other countries by a surge in imports when foreign investment attracted to the United States by new profit opportunities strengthened the dollar.",2003-09-24
"With increases in demand outrunning gains in potential output, it seemed evident that interest rates were going to have to rise at some point.",2003-09-24
Financial and economic crises in East Asia beginning in 1997 followed by the financial market turmoil after the Russian debt default in 1998 damped global demand.,2003-09-24
"In addition, as I pointed out earlier, the inflationary effects of excess demand were held in check by the productivity gain itself, which lowered business costs and raised profits, with the subsequent price competition reducing inflation.",2003-09-24
"In that environment, the unemployment rate fell a little below 4 percent without material effect on the rate of inflation.",2003-09-24
This high level of labor utilization probably could not have persisted indefinitely--at some point compensation might well have begun to accelerate beyond even that justified by the faster growth of labor productivity.,2003-09-24
"But, in the interim, the absence of increasing inflation pressures meant that the Federal Reserve did not need to tighten to bring demand back in line with the potential as soon as it otherwise might have needed to.",2003-09-24
"At the time, we could only observe outcomes that did not fit with preconceptions; try to find rationales that explained what we were seeing; and in the process, derive implications about the future that could be used to guide a forward-looking monetary policy.",2003-09-24
It also is now evident that demand became even stronger than was justified by the increase in potential.,2003-09-24
"Something real definitely happened--productivity growth turned up--but, not surprisingly, private agents had a hard time evaluating this change and calibrating its implications for profits, incomes, and wealth.",2003-09-24
"Nonetheless, overshooting and correction do not invalidate the basic story I outlined above--that underlying productivity growth did increase and over time such an increase in trend productivity boosted demand at least as much as supply--a pattern consistent with economic theory.",2003-09-24
"Productivity growth has remained quite strong, but demand has been inadequate to keep the economy expanding fast enough to create jobs.",2003-09-24
"The question is whether these circumstances are related--whether, as is often implied, the rapid productivity growth causes the weak employment.",2003-09-24
"In an arithmetic sense the relationship looks plausible--for a given path of demand, the more rapid the productivity growth, the weaker the labor market.",2003-09-24
But the arithmetic explanation does not comport with economic theory relating demand and supply over the longer run or with the experience of the late 1990s.,2003-09-24
The actual increase in productivity has been remarkable in the past few years.,2003-09-24
For productivity to accelerate early in a recovery is not unusual.,2003-09-24
But that surge typically follows a period of very weak productivity growth or even outright decline during recession when businesses lag in cutting back on labor.,2003-09-24
"Most often, the pickup in productivity is also associated with a very rapid increase in demand and activity, which businesses may not have anticipated in their hiring and which they meet in part by correcting some inefficiencies that built up earlier when the economy had unexpectedly weakened.",2003-09-24
The current cycle saw neither a decline in productivity during the downturn nor a rapid rebound in output once recovery began.,2003-09-24
"Instead, we have observed persistent strong productivity gains through the recession and even stronger increases in the modest recovery since then.",2003-09-24
"Nonfarm business productivity rose 3-1/4 percent in the recession year of 2001, 4-1/2 percent in 2002 and at a 4-1/2 percent rate so far this year.",2003-09-24
"It is also evident that despite rapid productivity growth, demand has been tepid.",2003-09-24
"Moreover, the weakness has been led by business investment, which in our story ought to respond strongly to rising productivity.",2003-09-24
"Demand has been sufficiently weak that jobs have continued to decline, opening up economic slack and putting further downward pressure on an already low inflation rate.",2003-09-24
Surely one important explanation for the weakness in demand is that the economy has been paying the price for previous over-exuberance.,2003-09-24
"As a consequence, beginning in late 2000, investment fell sharply as firms worked to align increases in capital stocks with now-lower longer-term expectations for growth in sales and earnings.",2003-09-24
"Similarly, as equity prices fell, households needed to raise saving rates to achieve life-cycle objectives for wealth accumulation.",2003-09-24
"In sum, just as an increase in expected productivity growth tends to cause spending to rise, a downward adjustment in expected productivity growth, even if from unrealistic levels, will tend to bring with it a reduction in demand.",2003-09-24
It was not only capital spending and equity prices that seemed to overshoot in the late 1990s; credit was provided with undue optimism about prospects for repayment.,2003-09-24
"These corrections explain part of the weakness in demand, but they do not help us understand why productivity has been so rapid or why the productivity growth has not elicited a stronger response in demand.",2003-09-24
A clue is provided by the observation that the source of the productivity gains has shifted since the late 1990s.,2003-09-24
Productivity was boosted importantly by high investment earlier but not more recently.,2003-09-24
"From a growth accounting perspective, capital deepening--the amount of capital for each worker--has become much less important as a contributor to productivity growth since 2000, with most of the increases attributed to rising multifactor productivity.",2003-09-24
"Lags between the introduction of new technology and its full effects on productivity have been evident in history, and perhaps we are now seeing a version of these lags with respect to information technology.",2003-09-24
"In the second half of the 1990s, the cost of high-tech equipment was falling so quickly and applications for it were spreading so rapidly that businesses found that they could raise productivity substantially by buying large amounts of this new equipment and other capital goods geared to working with it.",2003-09-24
"Obviously, productivity growth generated through this rationalization process will not have the direct demand-augmenting effect of productivity increases realized through more rapid investment spending.",2003-09-24
The shifts in the relationship between demand and productivity and in the source of productivity growth probably have been accentuated by the changing economic and financial environment.,2003-09-24
"The rapid growth of output, the high profits, and the elevated share prices of the second half of the 1990s seemed to lead businesses to concentrate on expanding and on acquiring the latest technology rather than on wringing all they could out of the capital they were buying.",2003-09-24
"The drop in profits, the heightened caution in financial markets, and the slower growth of demand in the past few years have reduced incentives to expand and have put considerable pressure on businesses to damp spending and cut costs.",2003-09-24
"To the extent that the productivity increases of the past few years are resulting from businesses learning how to use existing technologies and capital more effectively and from more intense pressure to realize cost savings, productivity gains in the future may not be as large as those experienced recently.",2003-09-24
"If private agents hold this view, expectations of future income and profits would be damped relative to the outsized productivity gains of late, curtailing the indirect effects of those gains on demand.",2003-09-24
"In addition, the perceptions of households and firms about the growth of future income and profits may be heavily influenced by their recent experience, perhaps even more than by the longer-term trends in productivity and potential output that figure so prominently in our economic models.",2003-09-24
"Just as households and businesses may have extrapolated earlier very rapid, but unsustainable, economic growth, it would not be surprising if the recent economic weakness may have led them to expect smaller increases in output and income than will turn out to be justified by underlying trends.",2003-09-24
"Businesses in particular appear to have been quite restrained in their projections of future sales, likely further damping demand over the past few years.",2003-09-24
"Moreover, the attacks of September 11, 2001, and subsequent geopolitical uncertainties, reflected in part in energy prices and in volatile financial markets, have given businesses added reasons to be guarded about the outlook and cautious in making the commitments for the future inherent in purchases of capital goods and expanding the workforce.",2003-09-24
The combination of high productivity growth and weak demand has presented some interesting issues for monetary policy.,2003-09-24
"As events have unfolded, surprisingly rapid productivity growth that did not feed through immediately to demand has had important implications for the stance of policy.",2003-09-24
"With a very high pace of output growth needed just to keep margins of slack from rising but substantial restraints on demand, policy has had to be more accommodative for longer than it would otherwise have been.",2003-09-24
"Nonetheless, growth has not yet strengthened sufficiently long enough to stabilize the job market, much less to begin to eat into the considerable margins of excess labor and capital capacity.",2003-09-24
I want to emphasize that the problem has not been productivity growth per se.,2003-09-24
The difficulty for policymakers has been anticipating how demand would evolve relative to the productivity-enhanced path of potential supply.,2003-09-24
"Because productivity increases are not raising demand as much as might have been expected and may even have been delaying the recovery of investment by enabling businesses to increase output without expanding physical capacity, and because other forces also are holding back demand, the size of the task facing macroeconomic policies in promoting high employment has been all the greater.",2003-09-24
The reasons for pursuing an unusually easy policy to speed a return to higher levels of resource utilization have been bolstered by the effects of rapid productivity growth on inflation.,2003-09-24
Gains in efficiency have damped prices directly by holding down costs and indirectly to the extent they have made the tendency toward slack in labor markets greater.,2003-09-24
Inflation has been quite low--to the point of meeting Chairman Greenspan's definition of price stability as a situation in which expected price increases do not affect the decisions of households and businesses.,2003-09-24
"In that circumstance, further declines in inflation will not increase economic efficiency; indeed, they could complicate the future conduct of policy if they resulted in inflation and nominal interest rates so low that the monetary authority had inadequate scope to counter downward shocks to demand with its usual policy instrument of the short-term interest rate.",2003-09-24
"As the Committee's minutes relate, the desirability of forestalling significant additional declines in inflation has been a factor in the Federal Reserve's aggressive easing of policy in recent years and in its judgment that accommodative policy will be required for a ""considerable period.""",2003-09-24
"Going Forward Long-term trends in productivity are extraordinarily difficult to forecast, as we learned in the 1970s and the 1990s.",2003-09-24
"Nonetheless, I do not think I am too far out on a limb in predicting that the underlying growth in productivity over the next several years is likely to be less than the extraordinarily rapid gains of the past year or so but to remain considerably in excess of the weak growth of the 1970s and 1980s.",2003-09-24
"Still, the persistent outsized increases in productivity testify to the continuing potential for using new technologies to achieve greater efficiencies, and we have no reason to think that they have been fully exploited.",2003-09-24
The rise in productivity is unambiguously beneficial over the long run.,2003-09-24
"And over time, demand should strengthen at least enough to match potential supply.",2003-09-24
"In particular, businesses will want to begin adding to capital stocks to keep pace with continuing growth in sales.",2003-09-24
Further declines in the relative prices of high-tech capital goods will reinforce the incentives to make these additions.,2003-09-24
The resumption of growth in capital implies a considerable rebound in investment.,2003-09-24
Such a strengthening will require that businesses feel comfortable with their current level of capital and more confident that demand for their products will grow in the future.,2003-09-24
"Most of this demand is probably for replacement and modernization rather than expansion, but the stepping-up of such purchases after a long period in which replacement cycles had been stretched out does suggest that the sense of gloom is lifting, even if it has not been replaced yet by optimism about the growth of future sales.",2003-09-24
A substantial rise in equity prices since late last year has also evidenced greater confidence by investors and has helped to strengthen household balance sheets.,2003-09-24
It will be a while before we can be sure that a self-sustaining expansion is underway of sufficient strength and persistence to put the economy back on a path toward full employment.,2003-09-24
"Although I had other offers of employment at higher pay, it was an easy call to come work at a research operation with, perhaps, one of the best business-oriented libraries in the country.",1996-10-16
"The American economy, more then than now, was viewed as the ultimate in technology and productivity in virtually all fields of economic endeavor.",1996-10-16
"Accordingly, while the weight of current economic output is probably only modestly higher than it was a half century ago, value added, adjusted for price change, has risen well over threefold.",1996-10-16
Productivity accelerated.,1996-10-16
"At the turn of the century, electric power began its major expansion, revolutionizing the means of production in a manner that eventually created significant productivity advances.",1996-10-16
"Yet, with all the extraordinary technological advances of the past couple of decades, why have our recent productivity data failed to register any improvement?",1996-10-16
"First, insofar as recent productivity growth is concerned, I have a serious question about the quality of the data that we employ to measure output in today's economy.",1996-10-16
"Similarly, as Professor Paul David of Stanford and others have observed in an interesting line of research, it took a generation for electric motors to replace the steam engine to a point where aggregate productivity was measurably accelerated in the manufacturing area.",1996-10-16
It was only when plants were built horizontally that the electric motor came into its own and became a major factor in the advance of manufacturing productivity.,1996-10-16
"Professor David suspects, with many good reasons, that the ability of computer-based technologies to become fully reflected in our overall national productivity is being delayed as the infrastructure gradually, but progressively, adjusts to new modes of production.",1996-10-16
"To measure productivity and standards of living we need measures of output but, to measure output, we need to be able to define products clearly and in terms of units that do not change from one period to the next.",1996-10-16
"In these cases we can define reasonably well the unit of output and, accordingly, can know the price per unit.",1996-10-16
What is its price per unit and how does that price move from one period to the next?,1996-10-16
"What is the true price trend for the removal of cataracts, when the technology and the nature of the whole procedure is so dramatically different from what it was, say, forty or even twenty years ago?",1996-10-16

We do our best to construct overall price indexes.,1996-10-16
"Indeed, how will we measure inflation, and the associated financial market implications, in the twenty-first century when our data--using current techniques--could become increasingly less adequate to trace price trends over time?",1996-10-16
"Hence, we must assume that embodied in all products is some unit of output and hence of price that is recognizable to producers and consumers and upon which they will base their decisions.",1996-10-16
"Doubtless, we will develop new techniques of price measurement to unearth them as the years go on.",1996-10-16
"Other challenges at least as great as complications of price measurement will surely confront us as we advance into, and through, the twenty-first century.",1996-10-16
While I know that most of you would welcome any insights I might have about current U.S. monetary policy--whether the Open Market Committee will be raising or lowering interest rates at our next meeting--I prefer to focus instead on some issues that could become serious over the longer run.,2004-02-25
"These issues involve the persistent budget and trade deficits facing the American economy, issues that could eventually involve significant economic adjustments around the world.1 Large budget and trade deficits are not a new phenomenon.",2004-02-25
"At that time, the business press and many economists began referring to the situation as one of ""twin deficits.""",2004-02-25
"With the current re-emergence of both deficits, the phrase has come back into common usage--too common, in my view.",2004-02-25
"To be sure, in theoretical models there is a scenario by which budget deficits can create trade deficits, and one by which trade deficits can create budget deficits.",2004-02-25
"But there are also many scenarios by which either deficit can arise independently, or even by which budget and trade deficits can move in opposite directions, as they did in the 1990s.",2004-02-25
"In general, while budget and trade deficits can be linked, there are important differences between the two, both in how they respond to economic forces and in their long-run consequences.",2004-02-25
I start by examining the relationship between budget and trade deficits--why they are linked but not twins.,2004-02-25
I discuss the sustainability conditions for budget and trade deficits; the conditions that must be fulfilled for the debts on both accounts to be stabilized in relation to the size of the U.S. economy.,2004-02-25
"This discussion, in turn, raises further interesting distinctions between the two deficits.",2004-02-25
The Link The link between budget and trade deficits can be seen most naturally through the national income accounting framework.,2004-02-25
"In equation form, we have (1) NS = S - BD = I - TD On the left side of the equation NS refers to national saving, S refers to overall private saving, and BD refers to the government budget deficit.",2004-02-25
A budget surplus would be treated as governmental saving and added to private saving; a budget deficit would be treated as governmental dissaving and subtracted.,2004-02-25
It is by definition equal to the trade deficit TD.,2004-02-25
"In the equation, then, a trade surplus means that some national saving goes to building up claims on foreigners (national saving is greater than domestic investment) while a trade deficit means that some investment is financed by foreigners (national saving is less than domestic investment).",2004-02-25
Models of the economic growth process identify national saving as one of the key policy variables in influencing a nation's living standards in the long run.,2004-02-25
"The identity also makes clear that the budget deficit and the trade deficit can move together on a dollar-per-dollar basis, but only if the difference between private domestic investment and private saving is constant.",2004-02-25
"For example, if there were to be an investment boom, interest rates might rise to induce some new private saving and some new lending by foreigners.",2004-02-25
"The implied trade deficit might rise and, because of the rise in income, the budget deficit might fall.",2004-02-25
"In this case, the trade deficit would increase while the budget deficit fell.",2004-02-25
"Conversely, suppose that expansionary fiscal policy resulted in a rise in budget deficits.",2004-02-25
"If this expansion were totally financed by borrowing from foreigners, domestic interest rates would not change much, and domestic investment and private saving might not either.",2004-02-25
"In this scenario, there could be a simultaneous dollar-per-dollar change in budget and trade deficits--the classic twin-deficit scenario.",2004-02-25
"Such a situation is most likely to occur in small economies fully open to international trade and capital flows, economies in which domestic interest rates are determined by world capital markets and are independent of domestic economic variables.",2004-02-25
"But if domestic interest rates do change, as they likely would in either a closed economy or a large open economy, private investment and saving would also likely change, and any strict link between budget and trade deficits would be broken.",2004-02-25
"Because of the underlying relationship between saving and investment, budget and trade deficits could be strictly linked.",2004-02-25
"Budget and trade deficits should be viewed as linked, but not as twins.",2004-02-25
"Stability Conditions Although the economic implications and reactions of budget deficits and trade deficits differ, both are deficits.",2004-02-25
Another elementary accounting identity says that last period's debt level plus the current deficit equals the current period's debt level.,2004-02-25
"This identity is true whether we are talking about budget deficits building up the stock of outstanding government debt (a liability of the government sector to the private sector), or trade deficits building up the stock of external debt (the net stock of accumulated foreign claims against the United States).2 Economists have worried for years about optimal stocks of government and external debt.",2004-02-25
"It is that (2) d (g - i)/(1 + g) = p, where d is the stable ratio of debt to GDP, g is the nominal growth rate of the economy, i is the nominal interest rate in the economy, and p is the ratio of the primary deficit to GDP.",2004-02-25
"For budget accounts, the primary deficit is the national income accounts budget deficit, but excluding interest payments.",2004-02-25
"For trade accounts, the primary trade deficit is the current account deficit, excluding net interest and dividend payments to foreigners.3 As a general rule, the economy's growth rate and interest rate will be fairly close.",2004-02-25
"The equation says that if they are equal, the primary deficit must be zero to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio.",2004-02-25
"If the interest rate is slightly above the growth rate, as it would be in models without risk for economies that save less than the theoretical optimum, a nation with outstanding debt would have to run a slight primary surplus to stabilize its debt-to-GDP ratio.",2004-02-25
"If the effective interest rate on debt is slightly below the growth rate, as it has generally been found to be in the past for both deficits, a nation with outstanding debt could run slight primary deficits and not see the debt ratio grow.4 On the foreign side, this condition has until now been especially forgiving.",2004-02-25
"Since the net interest rate has been less than the GDP growth rate, the ratio of external debt to GDP could have been stabilized with a moderate primary trade deficit.5 Magnitudes It is well known that the U.S. economy now suffers both budget and trade deficits.",2004-02-25
But how do these deficits compare with the stability conditions?,2004-02-25
"Historically, there have not been significant instabilities in U.S. federal budget deficits.6 Overall deficits have averaged about 2 percent of GDP over the past four decades, but figure 1 shows that when interest is deducted, primary budget deficits have averaged close to zero, the approximate level that stabilizes the debt-to-GDP ratio.",2004-02-25
"The ratio did rise as high as 50 percent in the high-deficit years of the early 1990s, but it dropped sharply thereafter with the primary budget surpluses of the late 1990s.",2004-02-25
"As a result of recent fiscal changes, the budget has lately fallen into primary deficit again; this primary deficit is now more than 2 percent of GDP (1.5 percent after cyclical adjustment).",2004-02-25
"The deterioration reflects the much-discussed recent rapid growth in expenditures, along with significant tax cuts.",2004-02-25
"It will take extraordinary fiscal discipline just to keep the present primary deficit near its current level of 1 to 2 percent of GDP over the short, medium, and long run.",2004-02-25
"But because the United States has run persistent and sizable primary trade deficits since 1990, the net external debt is now 25 percent of GDP and rising sharply.",2004-02-25
"The primary trade deficit is now 5 percent of GDP, violating the stability condition by nearly this same amount.",2004-02-25
"While the trade deficit does have equilibrating tendencies, as will be discussed later, there are also forces that tend to increase it.",2004-02-25
Econometric studies of the basic demand for imports and exports find that the U.S. income elasticity of demand for imports is higher than the foreign income elasticity of demand for U.S. exports.,2004-02-25
"This means that even if the world economy grows at the same rate as the U.S. economy, our trade deficit is likely to widen, (apart from any changes in relative prices).8 Indeed, the U.S. primary trade deficit has widened steadily since 1990.",2004-02-25
"Adjustments I have just argued that the U.S. is now in violation of the stability condition for both budget and trade deficits--recently and moderately on the budget side, persistently and significantly on the trade side.",2004-02-25
With each deficit there is probably a credibility range.,2004-02-25
"For budgets, there may be a range within which the debt-to-GDP ratio can grow without significant changes in interest rates.9 As equation 1 indicates, economic performance in this range is by no means optimal, because the persistent deficits are subtracting funds that would otherwise be devoted to capital investment and future growth in living standards.",2004-02-25
But there may not be significant relative price effects.,2004-02-25
The same is true on the trade side; there could be a range in which foreign claims on the United States just build up without major impact on relative prices.,2004-02-25
"Once the economy gets outside of the credibility range, more significant relative price adjustments become likely.",2004-02-25
"The conventional view is that at some point there should be a relative price adjustment--some combination of rising U.S. interest rates (to make U.S. assets more attractive), rising foreign prices (to make imports more expensive), moderating U.S. prices (to make U.S. exports more competitive), or a change in exchange rates.",2004-02-25
That is why foreign trade deficits are typically thought of as self-correcting.,2004-02-25
Countries with large trade deficits often have their external liabilities denominated in a foreign currency.,2004-02-25
"This denomination effect would not permanently prevent any relative price adjustment, but it could lengthen the process.",2004-02-25
This monetary expansion could generate domestic inflation unless it is sterilized with other open market sales of securities--and the mere scale of present and expected future debt stocks may make continued sterilization impossible.,2004-02-25
"While trade deficits should ultimately correct themselves, perhaps after a long trek through the credibility range, there are really no natural self-corrective mechanisms for budget deficits.",2004-02-25
"Once the U.S. economy gets through the credibility range, interest rates on the increasing government debt will have to rise to induce people to hold the debt.",2004-02-25
"This rise increases the interest burden and causes total deficits to rise further, all the time subtracting more and more funds from capital accumulation.",2004-02-25
"In the long run, the only way to correct budget deficits is for policymakers to correct them.",2004-02-25
Outside Forces There are several outside forces--both natural and as a result of policy--that could influence budget and trade deficits.,2004-02-25
One generally helpful influence is productivity growth.,2004-02-25
"Say the U.S. economy benefits from an exogenous positive shock to productivity growth, as it seemed to have in the late 1990s.",2004-02-25
"This shock would raise the trend path of income, meaning that slightly higher primary budget and trade deficits could still be consistent with debt-to-GDP stability; in effect, a higher level of g can be plugged into equation 2 (at least as long as it is not offset by a higher i).",2004-02-25
"Higher productivity could also help lengthen the credibility range, the range in which moderate changes in the debt ratio might not lead to adverse changes in relative prices.",2004-02-25
"Among other things, higher productivity could raise the marginal product of capital and make investment in U.S. assets relatively attractive.",2004-02-25
"If they are violated, the natural adjustment mechanisms will eventually take over for the trade deficit, and the primary budget deficit will eventually have to be reduced to stop a growing government debt ratio.",2004-02-25
"While it might appear that trade protectionism would correct trade deficits, it probably will not.",2004-02-25
"Over the medium and long run, the economy should be producing near its natural growth path, perhaps because of timely monetary and/or fiscal policy, perhaps because of natural equilibrating forces in the economy.",2004-02-25
"Even if protectionist measures reduce imports, the added spending demands for import-competing industries will crowd out other types of production.",2004-02-25
"Put another way, equation 1 shows that the trade deficit is ultimately determined by national saving and investment.",2004-02-25
"Finally, suppose politicians actually do correct budget deficits, again assuming an economy near its medium-term growth path.",2004-02-25
"As mentioned above, such a fiscal austerity policy is the only known way to correct persistent budget deficits.",2004-02-25
The reduction in deficits should lower domestic interest rates and trigger changes in exchange rates that lower imports and raise exports.,2004-02-25
"They correct budget deficits directly, they reduce trade deficits indirectly, and the implied higher level of national saving also permits more funds to flow into capital formation and long-term productivity enhancements.",2004-02-25
Fiscal austerity is the one tried and true approach to dealing with budget and trade deficits simultaneously.,2004-02-25
"Conclusions There are obviously strong links between budget and trade deficits, and the deficit-debt dynamic relationships are very similar.",2004-02-25
"At the same time, it is misleading simply to equate the two deficits, as is often done in the twin-deficit literature.",2004-02-25
"Budget deficits typically involve a reduction in national saving and, if large, a steadily growing government debt-to-GDP ratio.",2004-02-25
"Trade deficits, on the other hand, typically involve an increase in foreign claims on the U.S. economy.",2004-02-25
"From a policy standpoint, neither deficit may be terribly harmful in the short run, and at least the recent fiscal deficits have been useful in stabilizing movements in output.",2004-02-25
"Moreover, there is likely to be a credibility range in which debt levels could rise relative to GDP without much change in relative prices.",2004-02-25
"In the long run, however, both deficits could become much more worrisome.",2004-02-25
"There are forces tending to increase both deficits: political and demographic for budget deficits, income elasticities for trade deficits.",2004-02-25
"At some point, continued large-scale trade deficits could trigger equilibrating, and possibly dislocating, changes in prices, interest rates, and exchange rates.",2004-02-25
Continued budget deficits will steadily detract from the growth of the U.S. capital stock and may also trigger dislocating changes.,2004-02-25

"Why have long-term interest rates not risen more, as they have done over previous policy tightening cycles?",2006-03-20
And what implications does this pattern of long-term interest rates have for monetary policy and the economic outlook?,2006-03-20
"In particular, I will conclude that the implications for monetary policy of the recent behavior of long-term yields are not at all clear-cut.",2006-03-20
"The goal, as you know, was to help ensure that the economic expansion would be self-sustaining and to protect against a remote risk that the fall in inflation observed during 2003 might culminate in outright deflation--an outcome that could have had potentially serious consequences for the economy and for the efficacy of monetary policy.",2006-03-20
"Indeed, with those concerns in mind, in 2003 the Federal Reserve made explicit for the first time that price stability is a symmetric objective: It is important to avoid inflation that is too low as well as inflation that is too high.",2006-03-20
"Providing information about the expected path of policy helped to ensure that long-term interest rates and other asset prices did not build in a projected pace of tightening that was more rapid than the Committee itself anticipated, and the statement's focus on the conditionality of future policy actions emphasized the ongoing need for both policymakers and financial market participants to respond to economic news.",2006-03-20
"In retrospect, the clear communication of policy provided notable benefits, in my view, by increasing the effectiveness of monetary policy while minimizing unnecessary volatility in financial markets.",2006-03-20
"In addition, the measured pace of rate increases gave the Committee time to observe the progress of the economy and to adjust its plans and communications strategy accordingly.1 To be sure, gradualism was possible only because inflation expectations remained contained--testimony to the importance of a central bank's retaining credibility in financial markets and among businesses and households.",2006-03-20
"A fourth interesting aspect of the latest tightening cycle, which is my principal focus this evening, is the behavior of long-term interest rates.",2006-03-20

"Current and near-term forward rates are particularly sensitive to monetary policy actions, which directly affect spot short-term interest rates and strongly influence market expectations of where spot rates are likely to stand in the next year or two.",2006-03-20
"Incidentally, by comparing forward rates implied by yields on nominal Treasuries with those implied by Treasury securities that are indexed for inflation, we can infer that about two-thirds of the overall decline in far-distant nominal forward rates over this tightening cycle has been associated with a drop in real yields, with the remainder reflecting a drop in inflation compensation.",2006-03-20
It is important to note that the marked decline in far-forward interest rates has not been confined to U.S. Treasury securities.,2006-03-20
Some Reasons for the Decline in Far-Forward Rates Why have the far-forward rates implied by the term structure of interest rates declined in recent years?,2006-03-20
"Another set focuses on special factors that may have influenced market demands for long-term securities per se, independent of the economic outlook.",2006-03-20
I will first consider explanations that emphasize possible changes in the net demand for long-term securities and later return to explanations that focus on the link between bond yields and the economic outlook.,2006-03-20
"As I have noted, each of the forward interest rates implicit in the term structure can be usefully decomposed into two parts: (1) the spot interest rate that market participants currently expect to prevail at the corresponding date in the future and (2) the additional compensation that investors require for the risk of holding longer-term instruments, known as the term premium.",2006-03-20
"With the economic outlook held constant, changes in the net demand for long-term securities have their largest effect on the term premium.",2006-03-20
"In particular, if the demand for long-dated securities rises relative to the supply, then investors will generally accept less compensation to hold longer-term instruments--that is, the term premium will decline.",2006-03-20
"To quantify the importance of the shift in the balance of demand and supply and of the consequent change in the term premium, we can appeal to the research literature on the term structure of interest rates.",2006-03-20
"In some models, these factors can be explicitly tied to observable economic variables, such as inflation; in other models, the factors represent statistical summaries of the data and have no explicit economic interpretations.",2006-03-20
"According to several of the most popular models, a substantial portion of the decline in distant-horizon forward rates over recent quarters can be attributed to a drop in term premiums.2 Using some of these models, we can further divide the term premium into two parts--a premium for bearing real interest rate risk and a premium for bearing inflation risk.",2006-03-20
"Both of these components have trended lower over time as well, according to the standard models, but the decline in the premium since last June 2004 appears to have been associated mainly with a drop in the compensation for bearing real interest rate risk.",2006-03-20
"At least four possible explanations have been put forth for why the net demand for long-term issues may have increased, lowering the term premium.",2006-03-20
"First, longer-maturity obligations may be more attractive because of more stable inflation, better-anchored inflation expectations, and a reduction in economic volatility more generally.",2006-03-20
"Since that time, the volatilities of both real GDP growth and inflation have declined significantly, a phenomenon that economists have dubbed the ""Great Moderation.""",2006-03-20
"I have argued elsewhere that improved monetary policies, which stabilized inflation and better anchored inflation expectations, are an important reason for this positive development; no doubt, structural changes in the economy such as deregulation, improved inventory control methods, and better risk-sharing in financial markets also contributed.3 Whatever the reason for the fall in macroeconomic volatility, if investors have come to expect this past performance to continue, they might believe that less compensation for risk--and thus a lower term premium--is required to justify holding longer-term bonds.",2006-03-20
"With long-term inflation expectations apparently anchored at low levels and with the prospect of continued economic stability, market participants may believe that it is appropriate to price bonds for an environment like that which prevailed four or five decades ago.",2006-03-20

"This experience has led a number of observers--including academics, journalists, and businesspeople--to assert that the Federal Reserve should have acted earlier to contain the sharp run-up in stock prices.",2002-10-15
"First, the Fed has a mandate from the Congress to promote a healthy economy--specifically, maximum sustainable employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.",2002-10-15
"The Fed likewise has two broad sets of policy tools: It makes monetary policy, which today we think of primarily in terms of the setting of the overnight interest rate, the federal funds rate.",2002-10-15
"By using the right tool for the job, I mean that, as a general rule, the Fed will do best by focusing its monetary policy instruments on achieving its macro goals--price stability and maximum sustainable employment--while using its regulatory, supervisory, and lender-of-last resort powers to help ensure financial stability.",2002-10-15
"The first part of the prescription implies that the Fed should use monetary policy to target the economy, not the asset markets.",2002-10-15
"Moreover, asset prices contain an enormous amount of useful and timely information about developments in the broader economy, information that should certainly be taken into account in the setting of monetary policy.",2002-10-15
"For example, to the extent that a stock-market boom causes, or simply forecasts, sharply higher spending on consumer goods and new capital, it may indicate incipient inflationary pressures.",2002-10-15
"Policy tightening might therefore be called for--but to contain the incipient inflation not to arrest the stock-market boom per se.2 The second part of my prescription is for the Fed to use its regulatory, supervisory, and lender-of-last-resort powers to protect and defend the financial system.",2002-10-15
"In particular, alone and in concert with other agencies, the Fed should ensure that financial institutions and markets are well prepared for the contingency of a large shock to asset prices.",2002-10-15
"The Fed can also contribute to reducing the probability of boom-and-bust cycles occurring in the first place, by supporting such objectives as more-transparent accounting and disclosure practices and working to improve the financial literacy and competence of investors.3 Finally, if a sudden correction in asset prices does occur, the Fed's first responsibility is to do its part to ensure the integrity of the financial infrastructure--in particular, the payments system and the systems for settling trades of securities and other financial instruments.",2002-10-15

"Finally, and crucially, it is a robust strategy, in that--although it certainly does not eliminate all economic and financial instability--it protects the economy against truly disastrous outcomes, which history has shown are possible when monetary policy goes severely off the track.5 The Opposing View: Preemptive Strikes against Bubbles As I noted at the beginning, however, the framework just articulated is not universally accepted, particularly the aspect that precludes attempts to guide the course of asset prices.",2002-10-15
"Instead, a number of critics have argued that monetary policy should be more proactive in trying to correct incipient ""imbalances"" in asset markets.",2002-10-15
"This debate is clarified considerably, in my view, by recognition that, in practice, the advocates of a more vigorous monetary policy response to asset prices fall into two broad camps, differing primarily in how aggressive they think the Fed ought to be in attacking putative bubbles.",2002-10-15
"The first group, who favor what I will call the lean-against-the-bubble strategy, agree that the Fed should take account of and respond to the implications of asset-price changes for its macro goal variables.",2002-10-15
"But also, according to this view, the Fed should try to gently steer asset prices away from a presumed bubble path.",2002-10-15
"For example, seeing a rapid appreciation of stock prices, not only should the Fed tighten enough to offset the likely effects of the boom on inflation and output, but also it should add another 25 to 50 basis points for good measure, in the hope of discouraging increases in stock prices it judges to be excessive.",2002-10-15
"At the risk of oversimplifying a large body of literature, I think one can usefully boil down many of these arguments to the idea that it may be worthwhile for the Fed to take out a little ""insurance,"" so to speak, against the formation of an asset-price bubble and its potentially adverse effects.",2002-10-15
Aggressive bubble-poppers would like to see the Fed raise interest rates vigorously and proactively to eliminate potential bubbles in asset prices.,2002-10-15
"But as a practical matter, this is easier said than done, particularly if we intend to use monetary policy as the instrument, for two main reasons.",2002-10-15
"First, the Fed cannot reliably identify bubbles in asset prices.",2002-10-15
"Second, even if it could identify bubbles, monetary policy is far too blunt a tool for effective use against them.",2002-10-15
"Though the price of (say) a share of stock is readily observable, the corresponding fundamentals--such as the dividends that investors expect to receive and the risk premium that they require to hold the stock--are generally not observable, even after the fact.",2002-10-15
"But there is the additional difficulty that the prices of equities and other assets are set in competitive financial markets, which for all their undeniable foibles are generally highly sophisticated and efficient.",2002-10-15
"Thus, to declare that a bubble exists, the Fed must not only be able to accurately estimate the unobservable fundamentals underlying equity valuations, it must have confidence that it can do so better than the financial professionals whose collective information is reflected in asset-market prices.7 I do not think this expectation is realistic, even for the Federal Reserve.",2002-10-15
"Several have been suggested, including the rate of appreciation of asset prices, various ratios that attempt to measure the return on stocks, and growth in bank credit.",2002-10-15
"First, many people appear to consider sustained increases in the prices of assets as prima facie evidence of a bubble, on the principle that what goes up must come down.",2002-10-15
"In fact, although no bull market goes on forever, historically it has by no means been the case that strong bull markets are inevitably followed by raging bears.8 Further, the fact that a particular rise in asset prices happens to be followed by a price decline does not prove that the initial increase was irrational or unjustified--sometimes strategies that are perfectly reasonable ex ante just don't pan out, as every bridge player knows.",2002-10-15
"Various price-return ratios, such as price-earnings or dividend-price ratios, may seem to have more potential as indicators of bubbles than do simple rates of price appreciation.",2002-10-15

"In December 1996, before my time at the Board, John Campbell of Harvard and Robert Shiller of Yale made a presentation at the Fed, in which they used dividend-price ratios and related measures to argue that the stock market was overvalued.",2002-10-15
"Though Campbell and Shiller were among those warning of a bubble in stock prices, and deserve credit for doing so, we should not lose sight of a simple quantitative point: According to their published article, their analysis of dividend-price ratios implied that, as of the beginning of 1997, the broad stock market was priced at three times its fundamental value (Campbell and Shiller, 1998, p. 13).",2002-10-15
"But I suspect that Campbell and Shiller's implicit estimate of the long-run value of the market was too pessimistic and that, in any case, an attempt to use this assessment to make monetary policy in early 1997 (presumably, a severe tightening would have been called for) might have done much more harm than good.",2002-10-15
"9 Part of the reason that the standard ratios were too pessimistic in 1997 was that at least some of the run-up in stock prices in the latter 1990s was apparently justified by fundamentals, as evidenced by the remarkable growth in output and productivity in recent years, the recent recession notwithstanding.",2002-10-15
"Pure bubbles--increases in asset prices that are 100 percent air--are, I suspect, rare.",2002-10-15
"So the problem of a bubble-popping Fed is much tougher than just deciding whether or not a bubble exists; to follow this strategy, the Fed must also assess the portion of the increase in asset prices that is justified by fundamentals and the part that is not.",2002-10-15
"In my view, somehow preventing the boom in stock prices between 1995 and 2000, if it could have been done, would have throttled a great deal of technological progress and sustainable growth in productivity and output.",2002-10-15
"Another possible indicator of bubbles cited by some authors is the rapid growth of credit, particularly bank credit (Borio and Lowe, 2002).",2002-10-15

"For example, an advocate of the lean-against-the-bubble philosophy could appeal to the ""insurance"" argument I noted earlier: Even if we can measure bubbles only imprecisely, is the optimal response of monetary policy to a perceived bubble literally zero?",2002-10-15
"To evaluate this argument, we must keep in mind an underlying premise of the lean-against-the-bubble strategists, which is that the response of incipient bubbles to monetary policy is more or less proportional to the policy action.",2002-10-15
"But such a smooth response is not well supported by either theoretical or empirical research on asset price dynamics.11 If a bubble--a speculative mania, in the more colorful language of the past--is actually in progress, then investors are presumably expecting outsized returns: 10, 15, 20 percent or more annually.",2002-10-15

"Strong's successor at the New York Fed, George Harrison, argued correctly that the availability of alternative sources of credit made this approach ineffectual and pushed for higher interest rates instead.",2002-10-15
"Hence, in 1928, in a situation in which the inflation rate was actually slightly negative and the economy was only barely emerging from a mild recession, the Fed began to raise interest rates.14 The New York Fed's discount rate, at 3.5 percent in January 1928, reached 6 percent by August 1929, its highest value since 1921.15 Rates on term stock-exchange loans peaked in that month at almost 9 percent, and the rate on call loans exceeded 10 percent in early August.",2002-10-15

"Conditions abroad were weakening, and both foreign and U.S. interest rates were rising.",2002-10-15
"The famous warning by Roger Babson that led to the ""Babson break"" in stock prices in September 1929 was based on mounting evidence that an economic slowdown was already in progress, implying that continued strong earnings growth could not be counted on.",2002-10-15
"Thus the stock market decline was more the result of developing economic weakness (and tight money) than the cause of the slowdown--though, obviously, falling stock prices did not help the broader economic situation in late 1929 and 1930.",2002-10-15
"Indeed, stock prices did not collapse in 1929 but only began to plummet when the depth of the general economic decline became apparent.",2002-10-15
"For example, stock prices in April 1930 were still about the same level as in January 1929; and someone who bought stock in early 1928 and sold in October 1930 would have almost broken even.",2002-10-15
"Only as the bad economic news kept rolling in, in the fall of 1930, did stock prices finally fall below 1928 levels.",2002-10-15
The true story is that monetary policy tried overzealously to stop the rise in stock prices.,2002-10-15

"There is little credible evidence of a bubble in the U.S. stock market before March 1928 (Galbraith, 1954; White, 1990); yet, in part because of the workings of the gold standard, U.S. monetary policy had already turned exceptionally tight by late 1927 (Hamilton, 1987).",2002-10-15

"The 1920s were in fact far from an inflationary decade in the modern sense; the Consumer Price Index in 1929 was essentially identical to its value in 1923, and prices fell from 1926 to 1929.",2002-10-15
"Strong's biographer quotes him as follows (Chandler, 1958, p. 427): ""I think the conclusion is inescapable that any policy directed solely to forcing liquidation in the stock loan account and concurrently in the price of securities will be found to have a widespread and somewhat similar effect in other directions, mostly to the detriment of the healthy prosperity of this country.""",2002-10-15
"More recently, Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz, in their monumental study of monetary policy in the United States, (1963, p. 290) wrote: ""Nonetheless, there is no doubt that the desire to curb the stock market boom was the major if not dominating factor in [Federal] Reserve actions during 1928 and 1929. .",2002-10-15
"In the event [the Fed] followed a policy which was too easy to break the speculative boom, yet too tight to promote healthy economic growth.",2002-10-15
"He wrote (1990, p. 179), ""Fearful of financial and economic dislocations, the Federal Reserve tried to restrain speculation first by direct pressure [that is, on the banks] and then by raising interest rates.",2002-10-15
It did however produce a general rise in interest rates that slowed the American economy and induced foreign central banks [who were constrained by gold standard rules to match American tightening] to raise their rates.,2002-10-15
"He wrote, ""Instead of allowing the stock market bubble to run its course, the Federal Reserve's tighter monetary policy pushed the economy further into recession, rendering it more vulnerable to the shock that came when the bubble finally burst.""",2002-10-15
"First, I believe that if central bankers allow the fluctuations in asset market prices to affect their decisions, it may distract them from concentrating on some combination of output growth and inflation.",2002-10-15
The focus of the Federal Reserve on the level of equity prices in 1929 clearly led to a disastrously contractionary path for policy.,2002-10-15
More recent research has shown that attempted bubble popping by monetary policymakers played an even greater role in the onset of the Great Depression than we had thought.,2002-10-15

"To get things going, I thought I would start with some brief remarks on the current state of play in monetary policy.",2013-06-28
"The first is its flow-based, state-contingent nature--the notion that we intend to continue with purchases until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.",2013-06-28
"Back then, the unemployment rate was 8.1percent and nonfarm payrolls were reported to have increased at a monthly rate of 97,000 over the prior six months; today, those figures are 7.6 percent and 194,000, respectively.",2013-06-28
"Back then, FOMC participants were forecasting unemployment rates around 7-3/4 percent and 7 percent for year-end 2013 and 2014, respectively, in our Summary of Economic Projections; as of the June 2013 round, these forecasts have been revised down roughly 1/2 percentage point each.",2013-06-28
"However, this very progress has brought communications challenges to the fore, since the further down the road we get, the more information the market demands about the conditions that would lead us to reduce and eventually end our purchases.",2013-06-28
"In particular, I view Chairman Bernanke's remarks at his press conference--in which he suggested that if the economy progresses generally as we anticipate then the asset purchase program might be expected to wrap up when unemployment falls to the 7 percent range--as an effort to put more specificity around the heretofore less well-defined notion of ""substantial progress.""",2013-06-28
It would have been difficult for the Committee to put forward a 7 percent unemployment goal when the current program started and unemployment was 8.1 percent; this would have involved a lot of uncertainty about the magnitude of asset purchases required to reach this goal.,2013-06-28
"However, as we get closer to our goals, the balance sheet uncertainty becomes more manageable--at the same time that the market's demand for specificity goes up.",2013-06-28
"However, when there is a two-way feedback between financial conditions and FOMC actions, an initial perception that noisy recent data play a central role in the policy process can become somewhat self-fulfilling and can itself be the cause of extraneous volatility in asset prices.",2013-06-28
"If the news is bad, and it is confirmed by further bad news in October and November, this would suggest that the 7 percent unemployment goal is likely to be further away, and the remainder of the program would be extended accordingly.",2013-06-28
"In sum, I believe that effective communication for us at this stage involves the following key principles: (1) reaffirming the data-dependence of the asset purchase program, (2) giving more clarity on the type of data that will determine the endpoint of the program, as the Chairman did in his discussion of the unemployment goal, and (3) basing interim adjustments to the pace of purchases at any meeting primarily on the accumulated progress toward our goals and not overemphasizing the most recent momentum in the data.",2013-06-28
"Specifically, we continue to have a 6.5 percent unemployment threshold for beginning to consider a first increase in the federal funds rate.",2013-06-28
"If, for example, inflation readings continue to be on the soft side, we will have greater scope for keeping the funds rate at its effective lower bound even beyond the point when unemployment drops below 6.5percent.",2013-06-28
"Yet as research has repeatedly demonstrated, these sorts of fundamentals only explain a small part of the variation in the prices of assets such as equities, long-term Treasury securities, and corporate bonds.",2013-06-28
"The bulk of the variation comes from what finance academics call ""changes in discount rates,"" which is a fancy way of saying the non-fundamental stuff that we don't understand very well--and which can include changes in either investor sentiment or risk aversion, price movements due to forced selling by either levered investors or convexity hedgers, and a variety of other effects that fall under the broad heading of internal market dynamics.",2013-06-28
This observation reminds us that it often doesn't make sense to try to explain a large movement in asset prices by looking for a correspondingly large change in expectations about economic fundamentals.,2013-06-28
"So while we have seen very significant increases in long-term Treasury yields since the FOMC meeting, I think it is a mistake to infer from these movements that there must have been an equivalently big change in monetary policy fundamentals.",2013-06-28
My only point is that consumers and businesses who look to asset prices for clues about the future stance of monetary policy should take care not to over-interpret these movements.,2013-06-28
"I hope that you will conclude from this discussion that, though the process of setting monetary policy is complex, it is nonetheless in many important ways accessible to the average citizen.",1999-06-10
"The Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is the most important monetary policy-making body of the Federal Reserve System.",1999-06-10
"After a short coffee break, we have a staff presentation on the alternatives we face in setting monetary policy.",1999-06-10
"Generally, an announcement of a change in interest rates, if any, is made at about 2:15 in the afternoon.",1999-06-10
Let me shift now from the mechanics of the process to the broader conceptual issues that confront the conduct of monetary policy and some of the issues surrounding the outlook for the U.S. economy.,1999-06-10
The Goals of Monetary Policy Federal law establishes the goals of monetary policy.,1999-06-10
"The Federal Reserve and the FOMC are ""to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.""",1999-06-10
"Many analysts believe that achieving price stability should be the primary goal of a central bank because a stable level of prices appears to be the condition most conducive to maximum sustained output and employment, and to moderate long-term interest rates.",1999-06-10
"This presumably is because in times of price stability the prices of goods, materials and services are undistorted by inflation and thus can serve as clearer signals and guides for the efficient allocation of resources.",1999-06-10
"Also, a background of stable prices is thought to encourage capital formation because it reduces the distortion created by a tax system that is only partly indexed for inflation.",1999-06-10
Some would argue that the remarkable period of growth that we are experiencing is due in no small measure to the low rate of inflation that has prevailed for some time.,1999-06-10
"In the long run, I have no doubt that price stability underpins efforts to achieve maximum output and employment.",1999-06-10
"But, in the short run, some tensions can arise between efforts to reduce inflation and efforts to maximize employment and output.",1999-06-10
"For example, the economy may at times be faced with adverse developments affecting supply, such as a bad agricultural harvest or a disruption in the supply of oil, which put upward pressure on prices and downward pressure on output and employment.",1999-06-10
"In these circumstances, makers of monetary policy must decide the extent to which we should focus on defusing price pressures or on cushioning the loss of output and employment in the short run, while still keeping an eye on our long-term objectives.",1999-06-10
"At other times, policymakers may be concerned that expectations of inflation will get built into decisions about wages and prices and, become a self-fulfilling prophecy.",1999-06-10
Countering this threat of inflation with a more restrictive monetary policy could risk small losses of output and employment in the short run but might make it possible to avoid larger losses later should expectations of higher inflation become embedded in the economy.,1999-06-10
"These labels are an effort to simplify, in fact oversimplify, the complex choices that each member of the FOMC must make in deciding how to trade off the risk that action, or inaction, on our part will lead to inflation heating up to unacceptable levels, against the risk of having inadequate creation of jobs.",1999-06-10
"But I believe that all members of the Committee recognize that, over the longer haul, the major contribution the Federal Reserve can make to higher standards of living is to promote price stability.",1999-06-10
"It is generally thought that monetary policy takes many months to have most of its effect on the growth of output and employment, while, of course, it has an immediate impact on financial markets.",1999-06-10
"Because of the long time-frame in which the effects on the real economy are realized, I believe that it is important for policy to look ahead as it aims at promoting stable prices and a sustainable GDP growth path, along which the economy is at full potential.",1999-06-10
"Given that we need to be forward-looking, or ""preemptive,"" as it is often put, one potentially important element in making monetary policy is the forecast or likely outlook for economic growth, unemployment and the price level for the next year or two.",1999-06-10
"Fortunately, as we make monetary policy we have the advantage of several forecasts.",1999-06-10
"To be useful for monetary policy, forecasts of the future health of the economy need to be reasonably reliable.",1999-06-10
"As one example, the failure of price inflation to pick up, as labor markets have become tighter is not consistent with the simple correlations that were so apparent in earlier cycles.",1999-06-10
"Moreover, factors outside of economists' models have provided some surprises, such as the Asian economic and financial turmoil and the gyration of oil prices.",1999-06-10
"In these circumstances, I believe, it is appropriate to put greater weight on incoming data to determine whether the stance of monetary policy should be changed.",1999-06-10
"Some of the variables relevant in this regard are: 1) the rate of change in wages or prices or early signs of emerging inflation, 2) the level of the unemployment rate and the pace of job creation, 3) the rate and composition of GDP growth (inventories, trade flows, consumption, investment, residential and commercial construction, and so forth), and 4) international developments.",1999-06-10
"Another set of variables to be considered in making monetary policy are financial variables, such as the money supply, interest rates, exchange rates, credit flows, and conditions in bank lending and in the debt and equity markets.",1999-06-10
"The last two years, 1997 and 1998, gave an interesting case study of the interplay between these different variables and the degree of forward-looking behavior in the making of monetary policy.",1999-06-10
"From March of 1997 through much of 1998, pleasant surprises in the performance of inflation and the general absence of early signs of inflation, and uncertainty about the relationship of changes in inflation to the level of resource utilization, kept the FOMC from tightening.",1999-06-10
We did not tighten despite the economy being beyond most estimates of its potential and despite many forecasts of rising inflation.,1999-06-10
"Put another way, the FOMC could have ""preemptively"" tightened monetary policy, based on forecasts, but recognizing the uncertainties about empirical relationships chose not to do so.",1999-06-10
"Indeed, monetary policy was eased in the fall of 1998.",1999-06-10
"Under those circumstances, the FOMC thought it appropriate to ease policy to offset a likely significant impact on future domestic spending and growth.",1999-06-10
"Finally, no discussion of monetary policy and financial markets would be complete without reference to the equity markets.",1999-06-10
"Therefore, equity prices have an influence on business fixed investment, along with household consumption.",1999-06-10
We have seen in other economies that bubbles and busts in financial markets can create unsettled conditions that impair real economic activity.,1999-06-10
These are just some of the factors that go into making monetary policy.,1999-06-10
"Outlook for 1999 With this general statement of the factors that go into setting monetary policy, let me turn to the outlook for 1999.",1999-06-10
"Real GDP grew more than 4 percent in 1998, on a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis, and maintained that rapid growth into the first quarter of this year.",1999-06-10
"The consensus, as represented by the most recent Blue Chip Economic Indicators, is that growth will be more moderate over the remainder of 1999, but that it will still total nearly 3-1/4 percent or so for the year.",1999-06-10
"The ability of Brazil, with the financial assistance of the international community, to weather its exchange rate crisis as well as it has to date, no doubt, has done much to allay some of the fears that were present in late 1998 and early 1999.",1999-06-10
"Finally, it is simply the case that many economists have come to the realization that they underestimated the underlying strength of domestic demand here in the United States-and the profitability of American businesses in that environment.",1999-06-10
"The strength in corporate profits in the first quarter not only impressed economists, but it also impressed investors, who drove stock prices up earlier this year.",1999-06-10
"That rise, through the effects I noted earlier, should continue to support domestic demand in the months ahead.",1999-06-10
"But, again underscoring an earlier point, this tightness of the labor market has not manifested itself in ongoing escalation of wage inflation.",1999-06-10
"Second, and more fundamentally, it is quite possible that we are seeing a pass-through of the more modest rates of price inflation we have enjoyed in the past couple of years into decisions about nominal wage increases.",1999-06-10
"This is, of course, a very healthy development-one that we hope will be sustained going forward, because it is central to the achievement of ongoing price stability.",1999-06-10
We must recognize that there have been a number of factors behind the favorable price performance we have been experiencing.,1999-06-10
"In part, it is due to an increase in productivity, as businesses have invested in high-tech equipment and adjusted the procedures of the workplace to get the greatest benefit from those investments.",1999-06-10
"This allows workers to become more productive and receive higher pay, which businesses need not translate into higher prices in order to remain profitable.",1999-06-10
"Moreover, we have already seen some reversal of some of these factors, most notably the sharp rebound in world oil prices and a surge in health insurance costs.",1999-06-10
"Under the circumstances, we must be concerned that, with the economy operating at such a high level of labor utilization and growth robust, we might be in some jeopardy of setting the stage for a an upturn in inflation.",1999-06-10
"In our announcement after our May 18 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee made it clear that we are watching things very closely and stand prepared to act promptly if the evidence begins to mount that inflationary pressures could be building.",1999-06-10
We observe developments in the economy and in financial markets and try to adjust monetary policy to the signals that we receive so that our nation's economic welfare is not threatened by inflation or by growth that persistently falls below the economy's potential.,1999-06-10
"Price stability is our responsibility as central banks--it is how, in the long run, we contribute to society's welfare.",2005-05-20
Achieving and maintaining price stability will be more efficient and effective the better we understand the causes of inflation and the dynamics of how it evolves.,2005-05-20
1 I think central bankers are asking more of inflation analysis these days.,2005-05-20
"In the United States, our attention was focused for many years on containing and then reducing inflation.",2005-05-20
"The risks and rewards were one-sided, and policymakers were mostly interested in whether inflation would rise.",2005-05-20
"Now that we are in the neighborhood of price stability, we can be faced with looking at the possibility that inflation will fall too low as well as rise too high.",2005-05-20
"Moreover, so long as inflation expectations are well anchored, we can tolerate limited changes in inflation, but we need to know that a rise or fall is not the beginning of a more extended trend.",2005-05-20
"Consequently, we focus closely on the reasons for any changes in inflation and their implications for the outlook.",2005-05-20
"Of course, I have always known how important the analysis and forecasting of inflation was for monetary policy, but I must admit that as someone who now has to go on record with a vote on the basis of some notion of the future course of inflation, the exercise has taken on added meaning.",2005-05-20
I thought I might take advantage of this captive audience of researchers on central bank policies to ruminate a bit on the evolution of inflation modeling and suggest areas for further research.,2005-05-20
The Stability of the Basic Framework I find it remarkable how fundamentally stable our basic framework for analyzing inflation has remained over the past thirty-five years or so: That basic framework is essentially the expectations-augmented Phillips curve introduced by Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps in the late 1960s.2 One of the key assumptions underlying this basic framework is the temporary rigidity of wages and prices.,2005-05-20
"It is because of these nominal rigidities that monetary shocks have real effects: In the well-known litany, wages and prices do not change immediately in response to a positive monetary surprise, so real interest rates fall, and spending is stimulated.",2005-05-20
But higher demand cannot be met without pushing firms up their marginal cost curves as they compete for scarce labor and other resources.,2005-05-20
"As opportunities to raise prices present themselves, firms take them to better align prices with costs.",2005-05-20
"That process may be gradual, because firms' competitors may not be raising their prices at the same time.",2005-05-20
"Expectations are a key part of the framework because wages and prices will be set for some time, and so it is important for workers and firms to consider the economic conditions expected to prevail during the period that the wages and prices are fixed.",2005-05-20
"If inflation is anticipated over the period ahead, wages and prices will be set commensurately higher as workers and firms strive to protect themselves against the erosion of their purchasing power.",2005-05-20
"As Friedman and Phelps emphasized, these efforts to protect against the erosion of purchasing power by inflation will mean that an ongoing and fully anticipated inflation will, to a first approximation, have no effect on the level of resource utilization; the outcome of the economy will be whatever the real forces at work dictate.",2005-05-20
Friedman called the unemployment rate determined by such real factors the natural rate of unemployment.,2005-05-20
An important implication of the expectations-augmented Phillips curve is that any attempt to use monetary policy to lower the unemployment rate below the natural rate on a sustained basis will end in failure.,2005-05-20
"Initially, expansionary monetary policy would lower unemployment as well as raise inflation.",2005-05-20
"As the stimulus continued, however, firms and workers would increasingly protect themselves against the higher inflation, giving an additional boost to inflation.",2005-05-20
"Eventually, there would be no additional employment; only a (self-reinforcing) higher rate of inflation.",2005-05-20
"In 1970, the Federal Reserve held a conference that addressed this then-new framework; the conference encompassed both theoretical extensions, including Lucas' first exposition of rational expectations, and empirical implementation.3 In its essentials, the way we forecast inflation today is not all that different from what came out of that conference.",2005-05-20
"That is, inflation is importantly a function of an output or employment gap relative to a natural rate, plus some measure of inflation expectations.",2005-05-20
"The framework was extended to allow for the effects of shifts in relative prices, such as crude oil and import prices.",2005-05-20
"Such shifts can feed through fairly directly to the measures of core inflation through their effect on business costs, though their influence on inflation should be temporary unless they get built into labor costs or inflation expectations.",2005-05-20
"We include these types of price terms today in our forecasting equations, and they are important to forming our views of the inflation outlook and thus to the policy process.",2005-05-20
"Much subsequent work--including, recently, among economists at the European Central Bank and the euro-area national central banks--has confirmed the key assumption underlying this model, which is that wages and prices are changed infrequently.",2005-05-20
"A key objective of Taylor's staggered-contracts model was to show that, in an economy with nominal rigidities, monetary policy can have important effects even when expectations are perfectly rational.",2005-05-20
"However, about a decade ago, Jeff Fuhrer and George Moore pointed out that inflation was more persistent than was predicted by the model with sticky prices and rational expectations.4 Since their work, a number of researchers have suggested that ""sticky information"" or rules of thumb can account for this excess persistence.",2005-05-20
Such departures of expectations from perfect rationality can be an important source of observed inflation dynamics.,2005-05-20
"In particular, the model addresses the Fuhrer-Moore critique by making inflation itself, as well as the levels of wages and prices, costly to adjust.",2005-05-20
"An advantage of a model with expectations that are, at least in part, rational is that we can address questions related to how the behavior of the economy may change when the systematic implementation of monetary policy changes.",2005-05-20
We also look at models that assume that inflation expectations are well modeled by lagged inflation--the original proposal of Friedman and of Phelps.,2005-05-20
"The Performance of the Board Staff's Inflation Forecast The Board staff forecasts distributed to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) are judgmental: Although the staff consults a variety of models in coming up with its forecasts, no one model can be said to summarize the staff view.",2005-05-20
"Also, the staff forecasts are not necessarily its best guess on how inflation will evolve; the forecasts are conditioned on an assumed path for monetary policy and, during some periods, at the behest of policymakers, the staff did not assume what it would have viewed as the most likely policy path.",2005-05-20
I have distributed a figure that shows the Board staff's four-quarter-ahead forecasts for inflation as measured by the core Consumer Price Index along with the actual outcomes.,2005-05-20
"As shown in the inset box, the root-mean-squared error of the staff projections has been smaller than that of a naïve benchmark model, in which inflation is assumed to continue at its pace over the preceding four quarters.",2005-05-20
"That is to say, almost one-third of the time, inflation has been either more than 1/2 percentage point higher, or more than 1/2 percentage point lower, than the staff has predicted.",2005-05-20
"Moreover, over the period shown, there was, on average, some bias in the staff's inflation forecasts; inflation has tended to come in lower than the staff anticipated, by about 0.2 percentage point per year.",2005-05-20
"Rather, a variety of factors has caused inflation to deviate from expectations.5 At times, demand was not as robust as anticipated, and unexpected but persistent changes in the foreign exchange value of the dollar and oil prices fed through to core CPI inflation on several occasions.",2005-05-20
But I will concentrate on one general phenomenon and two episodes that help illustrate how our understanding has evolved and some of the more general challenges for inflation forecasting over the past twenty years.,2005-05-20
One factor that may account for some of the upward bias over this entire period was a gradual reduction in the natural rate of unemployment.,2005-05-20
"For example, disability insurance rolls rose steadily over this period, which allowed many people who likely would have had above-average unemployment rates to withdraw from the labor force.",2005-05-20
"Also, in the early 1990s, many public opinion surveys indicated a sharp increase in worker insecurity--and workers who are anxious about losing their jobs will be less willing to risk unemployment.",2005-05-20
"In the 1988-90 period, the behavior of crude oil prices, unemployment, and the exchange rate were not especially surprising or anomalous.",2005-05-20
"In particular, inflation expectations perhaps were becoming better anchored, so that an unemployment rate below the natural rate was putting less pressure on inflation than it would have over the preceding twenty years.",2005-05-20
"Likewise, the staff may have overestimated the ongoing effects of the dollar decline on inflation, as the models in use at that time inevitably gave considerable weight to the experience of the 1970s.",2005-05-20
Empirical estimates unavoidably lag these sorts of endogenous changes in inflation dynamics.,2005-05-20
"For the period from 1996 to 1998, inflation also came in consistently lower than the staff forecast.",2005-05-20
"Here, the pick up in structural productivity growth was the likely cause: The historical record suggests that a sustained acceleration in productivity affects prices before it affects wages.",2005-05-20
"Thus, the pickup in productivity growth has a direct, depressing effect on costs--and thus ultimately on prices.",2005-05-20
It took Fed forecasters--and others--a while to discern the acceleration in productivity and its implications for inflation.,2005-05-20
This improved performance likely reflected the eventual recognition that productivity growth had increased on a sustained basis.,2005-05-20
"An Agenda for Further Research As I noted at the beginning of my remarks, research aimed at improving our understanding of and ability to predict inflation is essential to the central banker's mission.",2005-05-20
"My chart stops at 2000, but it is no secret that forecasters everywhere did not anticipate the extent of disinflation in the U.S. economy in 2003 and, even after the fact, have had trouble explaining what happened.",2005-05-20
"Moreover, the degree to which core inflation picked up in 2004 and 2005 also caught many economists, including this one on the FOMC, by surprise.",2005-05-20
Surprises are inevitable; aggregate supply and demand curves shift for reasons that cannot be anticipated.,2005-05-20
We could identify shocks sooner and get a better understanding of their likely effects on inflation.,2005-05-20
"In reviewing some of the advances of the past thirty-five years for this talk, I was struck by the degree to which so much of the work on rigidities and expectations seemed to be trying to find an elegant rationale at the level of the firm and the worker for the observed dynamic properties of aggregate price measures.",2005-05-20
"This work, while illuminating in many respects, does not seem to have greatly advanced the empirical forecasting of inflation.",2005-05-20
"I have a lengthy list of macroeconomic inflation puzzles whose answers would make me a better policymaker, but, for the most part, the solutions to the puzzles rest on a better understanding of how workers and firms set wages and prices.",2005-05-20
The reduced-form price equations we so often use for inflation prediction bypass direct contact with labor compensation issues.,2005-05-20
"Labor is the major element of business cost and as such often occupies a prominent role in policy discussions of inflation prospects, and the unemployment rate often proxies for resource slack more generally.",2005-05-20
"In the past few years, we have had some experience with wage setting under conditions of price stability, and nominal compensation showed greater flexibility than some observers had anticipated.",2005-05-20
"Too often, discussions of wage and compensation determination rely on descriptions of worker demands and expectations that seem drawn from an era of strong unions rather than from the more atomistic labor markets that dominate the U.S. economy these days.",2005-05-20
"A better understanding of the motivation and dynamics of how compensation is determined between firms and individuals or small groups of workers would help unravel a number of the inflation puzzles I think we face, including those involving productivity growth, globalization, markups, and expectations formation.",2005-05-20
Changes in Productivity Growth An important aspect of this story has been that productivity affects prices before it affects wages--that is why we were able to experience low and stable inflation in the latter part of the 1990s with the unemployment rate well below any estimates of its natural level.,2005-05-20
But is it really true that prices are more responsive to productivity than wages?,2005-05-20
Should the effects be symmetrical when productivity growth slows?,2005-05-20
How can we better estimate structural productivity and determine changes in its pace of growth more promptly?,2005-05-20
Globalization and the Inflation Process Several observers have argued that increased trade has been an important factor in the downtrend in inflation over the past two decades.6 One channel is said to be through greater competitive pressures and another through increased support for price stability engendered by the competitive environment.,2005-05-20
"Globalization might restrain prices and wages in those sectors in which imports play an increasing role, but how does it hold back the average wage and price level?",2005-05-20
The Behavior of Profit Margins or Markups The Federal Reserve's 1970 conference and much of the work since then has approached the determination of inflation as a two-step process: model both labor costs and the price markup over labor costs.,2005-05-20
Does it matter whether the shock to margins comes from a change in potential supply or aggregate demand?,2005-05-20
Inflation Expectations Measures of inflation expectations are among the variables I watch most closely as I formulate my policy recommendations because I recognize that changing expectations are a principal avenue by which short-term perturbations in price levels are propagated into more persistent changes in inflation rates.,2005-05-20
Yet our knowledge of the expectations that businesses and workers bring to the process of setting wages and prices is extremely limited.,2005-05-20

"August 04, 2021 Outlooks, Outcomes, and Prospects for U.S. Monetary Policy Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share Watch Live Outlooks and Outcomes for the U.S. Economy With the release of the gross domestic product (GDP) data last week, we learned that the U.S. economy in the second quarter of this year transitioned from economic recovery to economic expansion.1 Given the catastrophic collapse in U.S. economic activity in the first half of 2020 as a result of the global pandemic and the mitigation efforts put in place to contain it, few forecasters could have expectedâ€”or even dared to hopeâ€”in the spring of last year that the recovery in GDP, from the sharpest decline in activity since the Great Depression, would be either so robust or as rapid.",2021-08-04
"Indeed, just recently, the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating Committee determined that the recession that began in March of last year ended in April, making it not only the deepest recession on record, but also the briefest.2 Moreover, with the development and distribution of several remarkably effective vaccines, the monetary and fiscal policies presently in place should continue to support the strong expansion in economic activity that is expected to be realized this year, although, obviously, the rapid spread of the Delta variant among the still considerable fraction of the population that is unvaccinated is clearly a downside risk for the outlook.",2021-08-04
"Importantly, while it is customary in business cycle analysis to date the transition from the recovery phase to the expansion phase according to the calendar quarter in which the level of real GDP first exceeds the previous business cycle's peak, in past U.S. business cycles, the recovery in employment has always lagged the recovery in GDP, and this cycle is no exception.",2021-08-04
"Indeed, at the end of the second quarter of this year, even though the level of real GDP was 0.8 percent above the level reached at the previous business cycle peak, the level of employment as measured by the household survey remained about 7 million below the level reached at the previous business cycle peak.",2021-08-04
"So while it is accurate to say we are in the expansion phase of the cycle in terms of economic activity, we remain in the recovery phase of the cycle in terms of aggregate employment.",2021-08-04
"In June, the Federal Reserve released its most recent Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) for GDP, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the federal funds rate.3 The SEP provides summary information about the empirical distribution of the individual modal projections at the time of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting submitted by each of the FOMC participants (currently 6 Governors and 12 Reserve Bank presidents).",2021-08-04
"Each individual submits projections for the modal, or most likely, outcome for each variable in the survey under his or her assessment of the appropriate monetary policy path.4 Of course, if a participant's subjective distributions for possible outcomes for GDP, unemployment, and inflation are symmetric, the mode of each distribution submitted by each participant will equal its mean (and median), but in general, there is no presumption that the subjective distributionsâ€”or, for that matter, observed empirical distributionsâ€”for these variables are symmetric.",2021-08-04
"Indeed, an important addition to the SEP introduced in December 2020 is a set of charts showing the historical evolution of diffusion indexes for the assessment of the balance of risks to the GDP, unemployment, and inflation projections submitted by each participant.",2021-08-04
"In the June SEP round, my individual projections for GDP growth and the unemployment rate turned out to be quite close to the path of SEP medians for each of these variables over the 2021â€“23 projection window.",2021-08-04
"Under the ""median of modes"" outlook in the SEP, GDP growth this year is projected to be 7 percent on a Q4-over-Q4 basis, which, if realized, would represent the fastest four-quarter GDP growth since the 1980s.",2021-08-04
"Under the projections, GDP growth does step down to 3.3 percent in 2022 and further to 2.4 percent in 2023, but to a pace that still exceeds the projected pace of long-run trend growth in all three years of the projection window.",2021-08-04
"Not surprisingly, the projected path of robust GDP growth in the SEP translates into rapid declines in the projected SEP path for the unemployment rate, which is projected to fall to 4.5 percent by the end of this year, 3.8 percent by the end of 2022, and 3.5 percent by the end of 2023.",2021-08-04
"This modal projection for the path of the unemployment rate is, according to the Atlanta Fed jobs calculator, consistent with a rebound in labor force participation to its estimated demographic trend and is also consistent with cumulative employment gains this year and next that, by the end of 2022, eliminate the 7 million ""employment gap"" relative to the previous cycle peak I mentioned earlier.5 As is the case for GDP growth and the unemployment rate, my projections for headline and core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation are also similar to the paths of the SEP median of modal projections for these variables.",2021-08-04
"Under the projected SEP path for inflation, core PCE inflation surges to at least 3 percent this year before reverting back to 2.1 percent for the next two years.",2021-08-04
"Thus, the modal baseline outlook for inflation over the three-year projection window reflects the judgment, shared with many outside forecasters, that most of the inflation overshoot relative to the longer-run goal of 2 percent will, in the end, prove to be transitory.",2021-08-04
"Although in a number of sectors of the economy the imbalances between demand and supplyâ€”including labor supplyâ€”are substantial, I do continue to judge that these imbalances are likely to dissipate over time as the labor market and global supply chains eventually adjust and, importantly, do so without putting persistent upward pressure on price inflation, wage gains adjusted for productivity, and the 2 percent longer-run inflation objective.",2021-08-04
"First, if, as projected, core PCE inflation this year does come in at, or certainly above, 3 percent, I will consider that much more than a ""moderate"" overshoot of our 2 percent longer-run inflation objective.",2021-08-04
"Second, as always, there are risks to any outlook, and I believe that the risks to my outlook for inflation are to the upside.",2021-08-04
"Prospects for U.S. Monetary Policy In September 2020, the FOMC introducedâ€”and since then has, at each subsequent meeting, reaffirmedâ€”outcome-based, threshold guidance that specifies three conditions that the Committee expects will be met before it considers increasing the target range for the federal funds rate, currently 0 to 25 basis points.6 This guidance in September of last year brought the forward guidance on the federal funds rate in the statement into alignment with the new policy framework adopted in August 2020.7 To quote from the statement, these conditions are that ""labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.""",2021-08-04
"While, as Chair Powell indicated last week, we are clearly a ways away from considering raising interest rates and this is certainly not something on the radar screen right now, if the outlook for inflation and outlook for unemployment I summarized earlier turn out to be the actual outcomes for inflation and unemployment realized over the forecast horizon, then I believe that these three necessary conditions for raising the target range for the federal funds rate will have been met by year-end 2022.8 Core PCE inflation since February 2020â€”a calculation window that smooths out any base effects resulting from ""round trip"" declines and rebounds in the price levels of COVID-19-sensitive sectors and, coincidentally, also measures the average rate of core PCE inflation since hitting the effective lower bound (ELB) in March 2020â€”is running at 2.7 percent through June 2021 and is projected to remain above 2 percent in all three years of the projection window.",2021-08-04
"Moreover, my inflation projections for 2022 and 2023, which forecast somewhat higher inflation than do the SEP medians, would also, to me, satisfy the ""on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time"" threshold specified in the statement.",2021-08-04
"Finally, while my assessment of maximum employment incorporates a wide range of indicators to assess the state of the labor marketâ€”including indicators of labor compensation, productivity, and price-cost markupsâ€”the employment data I look at, such as the Kansas City Fed's Labor Market Conditions Indicators, are historically highly correlated with the unemployment rate.9 My expectation today is that the labor market by the end of 2022 will have reached my assessment of maximum employment if the unemployment rate has declined by then to the SEP median of modal projections of 3.8 percent.",2021-08-04
"Given this outlook and so long as inflation expectations remain well anchored at the 2 percent longer-run goalâ€”which, based on the Fed staff's common inflation expectations (CIE) index, I judge at present to be the case and which I project will remain true over the forecast horizonâ€”commencing policy normalization in 2023 would, under these conditions, be entirely consistent with our new flexible average inflation targeting framework.10 I note that under the June SEP median of modal projections, annualized PCE inflation since the new framework was adopted in August 2020 is projected to average 2.6 percent through year-end 2022 and 2.5 percent through year-end 2023.11 In the context of our new framework, it is important to note that while the ELB can be a constraint on monetary policy, the ELB is not a constraint on fiscal policy, and appropriate monetary policy under our new framework, to me, mustâ€”and certainly canâ€”incorporate this reality.",2021-08-04
"Indeed, under present circumstances, I judge that the support to aggregate demand from fiscal policyâ€”including the more than $2 trillion in accumulated excess savings accruing from (as yet) unspent transfer paymentsâ€”in tandem with appropriate monetary policy, can fully offset the constraint, highlighted in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, that the ELB imposes on the ability of an inflation-targeting monetary policy, acting on its own and in the absence of sufficient fiscal support, to restore, following a recession, maximum employment and price stability while keeping inflation expectations well anchored at the 2 percent longer-run goal.12 Before I conclude, let me say a few words about our Treasury and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) purchase programs.",2021-08-04
"In our December 2020 FOMC statement, we indicated, and have reaffirmed since then, that we will maintain the pace of Treasury and MBS purchases at $80 billion and $40 billion per month, respectively, until ""substantial further progress"" has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.",2021-08-04
"The financial press is full of reports on talks by member X reporting that growth is a bit strong (weak), the economy is working its way over a hill (through a valley), inflation (deflation) is a clear (remote) threat.",2003-01-04
"There seems to be an agreed code for translating these statements into the likelihood that member X will vote to raise (lower) interest rates at the next meeting, and the federal funds futures market responds accordingly.",2003-01-04
Most economists feel that fiscal policy should be anchored in the long run by the need to preserve overall national saving rates and prevent explosive growth in government debt.,2003-01-04
"In my view, monetary policy should be similarly structured.",2003-01-04
The long-run anchor is clearly price stability.,2003-01-04
"Following Milton Friedman, inflation in the long run is a monetary phenomenon, as is deflation.",2003-01-04
"Hence, the long-term goal of the Fed is to keep prices stable by some definition, avoiding either inflation or deflation.",2003-01-04
But the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate--to achieve not only price stability but also the maximum sustainable rate of employment.,2003-01-04
"If prices are stable in the long term, employment should grow along something like a full-employment path.",2003-01-04
"And, as with fiscal policy, if the long-term anchor is holding, the Fed should have the added ability to respond to short-term fluctuations in employment by raising or lowering interest rates without exciting market fears about inflation or deflation.",2003-01-04
"To earn this credibility the Fed should behave in a systematic way--generally lowering interest rates when employment rates are, or would otherwise be forecast to be, below the long-term sustainable rate; and raising interest rates when employment rates are, or would otherwise be forecast to be, above the long-term sustainable rate.",2003-01-04
"The most common is flexible inflation targeting (FIT), a monetary regime now used successfully by about twenty countries around the world.",2003-01-04
"Under FIT, the central bank or the government announces an inflation target and tries to hit it, not in the present quarter but over a one- or two-year period.",2003-01-04
"The most successful FIT regimes are also symmetric, permitting or requiring expansionary responses to an inflation rate that is below the target.",2003-01-04
"Under the Taylor rule, the central bank would try to establish a normal level of short-term interest rates but would raise rates as inflation threatens and lower them as unemployment threatens.",2003-01-04
"In a wide variety of circumstances, a sensible monetary response to a demand shock would look much the same for an FIT central bank as for a central bank following the Taylor rule.",2003-01-04
One distinction is that the Taylor rule does not require the central bank to announce a formal inflation target.,2003-01-04
But even this distinction may be more apparent than real if the central bank following a Taylor rule actually follows a reasonably steady inflation policy.,2003-01-04
"The Fed, for example, does not follow FIT and has never announced a formal inflation target.",2003-01-04
"But it has told the world many times that of all the available measures, it regards the price index for core personal consumption expenditures as the most realistic indicator of actual inflation.",2003-01-04
"The time series for this preferred indicator shows that, over the past seven years, inflation has averaged 1.7 percent per year, not much above what many consider to be an inevitable quality-change bias in the index, implying a true inflation rate of close to zero.",2003-01-04
"Pretty stable prices, and a pretty reasonable indication of an inflation target for a central bank that has never announced one.",2003-01-04
"As is well known, monetary policy works with long lags: a policy change influences aggregate demand in a distributed lag pattern beginning soon after the change and extending as long as eighteen months or two years.",2003-01-04
"This lag pattern places a premium on monetary policy being ahead of the curve, in current jargon.",2003-01-04
"Taken literally, a simple Taylor rule, with the central bank responding to current values of inflation and unemployment rates, is not.",2003-01-04
"However the policy strategy is articulated, anchoring it on some concept of long-term price stability is important, as is permitting short-term flexibility to deal with shocks; essentially the same goals most economists have in mind for fiscal policy.",2003-01-04
"Money versus Interest Rates For most of the post-World War II period, monetary economists have vigorously debated whether the Fed should target money or interest rates in setting policy.",2003-01-04
"As William Poole has shown, if spending shocks predominate, it makes sense to target money, or monetary quantities; if money demand shocks predominate, it makes sense to target interest rates.",2003-01-04
"In the short run, money demand shocks do seem to predominate, and most central banks in the world now operate in terms of some short-term interest rate.",2003-01-04
"Should they change interest rates rarely, as the European Central Bank appears to believe?",2003-01-04
Interest rate targeting can be thought of as monetary targeting with sterilization of shocks in the money demand function.,2003-01-04
"Under pure monetary targeting, interest rates would fluctuate with shocks in spending.",2003-01-04
"Under sterilized monetary targeting, interest rates would still fluctuate with shocks in spending.",2003-01-04
"In a period of many such shocks, interest rates should fluctuate, and a central bank that targets rates should permit them to fluctuate.",2003-01-04
"Thus, I have always felt it inconsistent to argue, as some do, that central banks should look partly to monetary targeting and be reluctant to change interest rates.",2003-01-04
"There may, of course, be some value in the smoothing of interest rate movements.",2003-01-04
"While recognizing the value of smoothing, I still feel that in the interest rate targeting regime the Fed now uses, we should at times be ready to change interest rates quite quickly in response to economic conditions.",2003-01-04
"In normal, middle-ground ranges, most central banks seem to feel that interest rate targeting works fine.",2003-01-04
"When inflation was rampant in the United States in the early 1980s, for example, the Fed under Chairman Paul Volcker for a time adopted money targeting to provide a clearer basis for policy.",2003-01-04
"At the time, inflationary expectations were exploding and it became very difficult to know what nominal interest rates should be.",2003-01-04
It was easier for the Volcker Fed to set the rate of monetary expansion at a sustainable long-term value consistent with stable prices and let nominal interest rates find their own level.,2003-01-04
"When short-term interest rates hit zero, the central bank may have to go back to monetary targeting to distinguish more-expansionary from less-expansionary policies, all of which entail short-term nominal interest rates close to zero.",2003-01-04
"In these circumstances, with prices actually falling, the central bank may have little choice but to expand liquidity quite rapidly in the hope that the liquidity will arrest deflation, even if nominal short rates remain stuck in the neighborhood of zero for a range of monetary growth rates.",2003-01-04
Bubbles The issue du jour in monetary policymaking is asset price bubbles.,2003-01-04
"Our mandate tells us to stabilize employment and the prices of goods and services, not asset prices.",2003-01-04
"It may be that stabilizing asset prices is the way to stabilize goods prices and employment, but one can think of many situations in which that does not seem to be the case.",2003-01-04
"In the late 1990s, for example, inflation was low and near a stable price target, and inflation showed few signs of accelerating.",2003-01-04
"Productivity, on the other hand, was clearly accelerating and apparently supporting a boom in stock prices.",2003-01-04
"We now know that faulty accounting practices may have aided those stock prices, but the full extent of these accounting problems was not clear then, even to those who looked mainly at the sanitized version of profits in the national income accounts.",2003-01-04
"One can debate interminably the proper monetary response in such circumstances, but it certainly seemed sensible at the time for the Fed to focus on its primary indicators, inflation and unemployment, and not to try to target asset prices.",2003-01-04
"Generalizing from this example, my own view of the matter is that whether we follow FIT or some version of the Taylor rule, we ought to have a forward-looking focus on inflation and unemployment.",2003-01-04
We ought to be anchoring policy to the goal of long-run price stability and responding to output shocks or other variables in a way consistent with this long-term price stability.,2003-01-04
"There may be times when asset prices become one of these other variables, or when rapid changes in asset prices may threaten the long-term stability of either of our primary goals.",2003-01-04
"In such cases we should not try to target asset prices, but we should take asset prices into account in our formulation of policy.",2003-01-04
"Exchange Rates One doesn't hear so much about it now, but in former days there was also a huge debate about exchange rate policy.",2003-01-04
"Should monetary policy be guided by the need to maintain currency parities or by the domestic needs of the economy, with currency rates left free to find their own levels?",2003-01-04
"In other words, fixed or floating exchange rates?",2003-01-04
Monetary policy needs an anchor.,2003-01-04
"When fixed exchange rates covered the whole world, that anchor was maintaining currency parities, or keeping all exchange rates stable.",2003-01-04
"Now that exchange rates are free to find their own level, for floating rate countries and outside the currency union, that anchor is gone.",2003-01-04
That is why it is all the more important for floating rate economies and unions to anchor monetary policy in terms of long-term price stability.,2003-01-04
The asset price question and the exchange rate question are connected in an interesting way.,2003-01-04
"In each case, many observers seem to want an exception--yes, monetary policy should target inflation, but it should also worry about asset prices (or exchange rates).",2003-01-04
"In each case, my own preferred approach is to take the other variable into account in performing our main job of dealing with inflation and unemployment but not to target asset prices (or exchange rates).",2003-01-04
"Though a consensus on exchange rate regimes may be emerging, the related issue of how exchange rates respond to monetary changes seems anything but settled.",2003-01-04
"In the textbook world of Mundell-Fleming, unanticipated monetary ease leads to lower interest rates, a drop in the home currency's value, and a stimulus to net exports.",2003-01-04
"If the central bank is implementing policy by setting interest rates, what are these target interest rates?",2003-01-04

"May 12, 2021 U.S. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the ""NABE International Symposium: A Vision of the Economy Post COVID,"" Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share It is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today at the National Association for Business Economics International Symposium: A Vision of the Economy Post COVID.1 So much has happened since we last met in Washington in February 2020, but I am grateful that technology is allowing us to gather once again, if only virtually.",2021-05-12
"I look forward, as always, to my conversation with Ellen Zentner, but first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and our new monetary policy framework.",2021-05-12
"Gross domestic product (GDP) collapsed by more than 30 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter of 2020; more than 22 million jobs were lost, wiping out a decade of employment gains; the unemployment rate rose from a 50-year low of 3.5 percent in February to almost 15 percent in April; and inflation plummeted in response to a collapse in aggregate demand that dwarfed the contraction in aggregate supply.",2021-05-12
"So far, the economic activity data we have received this year is consistent with this outlook.",2021-05-12
"However, after looking at the details of Friday's disappointing employment report, the near-term outlook for the labor market appears to be more uncertain than the outlook for economic activity.",2021-05-12
"Employment remains 8.2 million below its pre-pandemic peak, and the true unemployment rate adjusted for participation is closer to 8.9 percent than to 6.1 percent.",2021-05-12
"At the recent pace of payroll gainsâ€”roughly 500,000 per month over the past three monthsâ€”it would take until August 2022 to restore employment to its pre-pandemic level.",2021-05-12
But what this necessary rebalancing of labor supply and demand means for wage and price dynamics will depend importantly on the pace of recovery in labor force participation as well as the extent to which there are post-pandemic mismatches between labor demand and supply in specific sectors of the economy and how long any such imbalances persist.,2021-05-12
Readings on inflation on a year-over-year basis have recently increased and are likely to rise somewhat further before moderating later this year.,2021-05-12
"Over the next few months, 12-month measures of inflation are expected to move above our 2 percent longer-run goal, largely reflecting, I believe, transitory factors such as a run of year-over-year comparisons with depressed service-sector prices recorded last spring as well as the emergence of some supply bottlenecks that may limit how quickly production can rebound in certain sectors.",2021-05-12
"However, under my baseline outlook, these one-time increases in prices are likely to have only transitory effects on underlying inflation, and I expect inflation to return toâ€”or perhaps run somewhat aboveâ€”our 2 percent longer-run goal in 2022 and 2023.",2021-05-12
"This outcome would be entirely consistent with the new framework the Federal Reserve unanimously adopted in August 2020 and began to implement at our September 2020 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.2 Recent FOMC Decisions and the New Monetary Policy Framework At FOMC meetings convened since the new framework was announced last August, the Committee made important changes to our policy statement that upgraded our forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate and asset purchases to bring it in line with our new framework.",2021-05-12
"As announced in the September 2020 FOMC statement and reiterated in the following statementsâ€”including the most recent oneâ€”with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, our policy will aim to achieve inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal.3 We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomesâ€”as well as our maximum-employment mandateâ€”are achieved.",2021-05-12
"We also expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.",2021-05-12
"We indicated that we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and our holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress, measured relative to the December 2020 announcement, has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.",2021-05-12
"In our new framework, we acknowledge that policy decisions going forward will be based on the FOMC's estimates of ""shortfalls [emphasis added] of employment from its maximum level""â€”not ""deviations.",2021-05-12
"""4 This language means that, going forward, a low unemployment rate, in and of itself, will not be sufficient to trigger a tightening of monetary policy absent any evidence from other indicators that inflation is at risk of moving above mandate-consistent levels.",2021-05-12
"With regard to our price-stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importanceâ€”and the challengeâ€”of keeping inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent in a world in which an effective-lower-bound constraint is, in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate.5 To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it will conduct policy to achieve inflation outcomes that keep long-run inflation expectations anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal.",2021-05-12
"As Chair Powell indicated in his Jackson Hole remarks, we think of our new framework as an evolution from ""flexible inflation targeting"" to a ""flexible form of average inflation targeting.",2021-05-12
"""6 While this new framework represents a robust evolution in our monetary policy strategy, this strategy is in service to the dual-mandate goals of monetary policy assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congressâ€”maximum employment and price stabilityâ€”that remain unchanged.7 Concluding Remarks Notwithstanding the recent flow of encouraging macroeconomic data, the economy remains a long way from our goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved.",2021-05-12
Our guidance for interest rates and asset purchases ties the path of the federal funds rate and the size of the balance sheet to our employment and inflation goals.,2021-05-12
"As you know, long-term growth in productivity is critically important to improving the standard of living in any economy.",2006-01-18
The rate of growth of productivity can significantly affect inflation and economic expansion.,2006-01-18
"But before I comment on productivity, I'd like to begin with a review of recent economic developments.",2006-01-18
Economic DevelopmentsReal economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.,2006-01-18
"However, for the nation as a whole, employment and industrial production indicators were only briefly disrupted by the hurricanes during the late summer and early fall.",2006-01-18
"At the national level, consumer spending has been well maintained, and the fundamentals--such as income growth and household balance sheets--remain supportive.",2006-01-18
"Turning to prices, core inflation has stayed relatively low in recent months despite the run-up in energy costs.",2006-01-18
"For example, the twelve-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, a widely watched indicator of core inflation, moved down from 2.3 percent in November 2004 to 1.8 percent in November 2005.",2006-01-18
"Although energy prices have receded from the highs last fall, crude oil costs are still well above year-earlier levels.",2006-01-18
"As a result, gasoline prices remain elevated despite a decline of about 70 cents per gallon from the peak recorded in the aftermath of the hurricanes.",2006-01-18
"The prices for home heating oil and natural gas will add to consumers' budget pressures this winter; although spot prices have moved lower in recent weeks, they are still well above year earlier levels.",2006-01-18
"Higher energy prices have also affected businesses, particularly in those industries with energy-intensive production processes and those that purchase a large share of energy-intensive products, such as industrial chemicals and plastics.",2006-01-18
"There is only limited evidence, most of it anecdotal, of pass-through to consumer prices from the run-up in energy prices.",2006-01-18
"However, we are seeing the effects in the price data for certain energy-intensive categories, such as transportation.",2006-01-18
Futures markets currently expect only limited increases in the price of crude oil this year.,2006-01-18
"Nevertheless, tight resource utilization is likely to put pressure on prices.",2006-01-18
"The unemployment rate, at 5 percent in the second half of 2005, was down about 1 1/4 percentage points from its recent peak in early 2003 and at its lowest level in four years.",2006-01-18
"As in the mid- to late-1990s, resilient productivity growth appears to be helping contain the inflationary pressures that might otherwise be expected to accompany a narrowing margin of resource slack.",2006-01-18
"That said, we at the Federal Reserve will remain vigilant for any sign of a deterioration in the inflation outlook.",2006-01-18
"As I mentioned earlier, the core inflation rate has stayed relatively low in recent months, as rapid gains in productivity have tended to offset cost increases.",2006-01-18
"Corporate balance sheets have improved dramatically over the past couple of years because of surging profits, low interest rates, and a concerted deleveraging, which have combined to reduce debt burdens and increase liquidity in the form of cash assets.",2006-01-18
"Generally speaking, the growth of profits and the related buildup of cash have been broadly distributed across industries.",2006-01-18
Productivity and TechnologyLet me now turn from the overall economic outlook to productivity and technology developments.,2006-01-18
Productivity growth receives a considerable amount of attention from policymakers because its rate is an important determinant of a nation's standard of living.,2006-01-18
"The development of farm machinery in the early 1800s, for example, boosted the productivity of farmers and consequently freed up labor to shift to the industrial sector.",2006-01-18
"More recently, continued increases in industrial productivity have enabled a relative shift of employment into the production of services.",2006-01-18
"Although manufacturing employment has fallen sharply in recent years, both in absolute terms and as a share of total employment, the output of the nation's manufacturers has continued to increase because of impressive productivity gains.",2006-01-18
"Looking beyond manufacturing to the broader nonfarm business sector, we see that productivity growth has risen significantly over the past decade in the United States.",2006-01-18
Labor productivity gains accelerated from an average annual increase of 1 1/2 percent over 1973-95 to an average annual increase of 2 1/2 percent over 1995-2001.,2006-01-18
"From the first quarter of 2001 through the third quarter of 2005, labor productivity growth picked up even more--to an annual rate of nearly 3 1/2 percent.",2006-01-18
"These productivity gains result from many forces, including business investment that has increased the amount and quality of capital available to the workforce, business process innovations, and the growth of innovative, research-intensive industries such as information technology and biotechnology.",2006-01-18
"Because firms may take a while to absorb a rapid run-up in investment, the productivity payoffs to investment may be drawn out for some time as firms learn more effective ways to use the capital they have acquired.",2006-01-18
Anecdotal information suggests that some of the recent productivity gains appear to reflect firms making better use of existing capital and improving business processes.,2006-01-18
"As I noted, the growing importance of the innovative technology sector has spurred productivity growth.",2006-01-18
"Moreover, economists better understand the role of IT in the U.S. economy, particularly its influence on productivity growth, because developments in this sector are more easily quantified than developments in other pioneering fields, such as biotechnology.",2006-01-18
"In thinking about information technology equipment and productivity, I find a useful starting point to be recalling the role of IT capital accumulation during the last business cycle.",2006-01-18
Work by Federal Reserve economists suggests that a large chunk of the increase in the rate of productivity growth in the late-1990s was due to the accumulation of IT capital.,2006-01-18
The accumulation of IT capital boosted productivity growth in many industries.,2006-01-18
"As a result, in recent years firms appear to be realizing further productivity gains as they discover new and better methods for using IT.",2006-01-18
These synergies may spur adoption of new technologies and increase the potential for further productivity gains.,2006-01-18
"With demand for IT continually evolving, taking a moment to review the U.S. role in the production of IT equipment is worthwhile.",2006-01-18
"Because the development and the production of IT products play a vital role in the U.S. economy, the Federal Reserve continually watches for new developments in the pace of technological change and tries to gauge the likely influences of these developments on productivity growth.",2006-01-18
"In most cases, data on the pace of technological change are hard to come by, so we carefully examine data on production and price trends.",2006-01-18
"In light of the difficulties and uncertainties that are associated with measuring the pace of technological change, I want to take a moment to comment on the risks for the appropriate conduct of monetary policy that are associated with technology and productivity.",2006-01-18
"Because technology feeds into various macroeconomic aggregates--including household and business spending, productivity, and inflation--its implications for the U.S. economy will continue to necessitate careful observation, improved measurement, and study.",2006-01-18
"And good communication strengthens the effectiveness of good policy, largely because expectations are so important to the choices that households and businesses make about spending and saving and about prices and wages, as well as to the asset prices that help shape those choices.",2008-01-05
"Enhanced Economic ProjectionsAs already noted, I believe that the additional information in the enhanced projections the FOMC announced in November should be a substantial step forward in increasing public understanding of monetary policy decisions.2 The enhanced projections give more information about the FOMC's medium-term outlook for the economy.",2008-01-05
"That's particularly important, because the lags in the effect of policy on economic activity and prices mean that policy decisions are necessarily based on a view of the likely path for the economy over several years, relative to the Federal Reserve's legislated objectives of maximum employment and stable prices.",2008-01-05
"For example, given the starting point for the outlook, the forecasts will trace out a path for the economy to preserve or reestablish maximum employment and price stability that will reflect FOMC participants' views of the relative variation in output and inflation that is possible in the short run.",2008-01-05
"In addition, FOMC participants' projections of growth and unemployment in the third year of their forecasts will be influenced significantly by their interpretation of maximum sustainable growth and resource utilization, given their understanding of the likely growth of productivity and structure of labor markets.",2008-01-05
And our projections for inflation in year three will depend importantly on our sense of what inflation rate is consistent with our mandates for employment and price stability.,2008-01-05
"That projection, along with the path to year-three inflation, should help the public differentiate short-term shocks to price stability from the longer-term price trends it should use for planning purposes.",2008-01-05
"Over time, as actual inflation tends toward the year-three forecasts, inflation expectations may well become even more firmly anchored than they are today.",2008-01-05
"In another change, the Committee included total consumer inflation in its forecasts along with the core measure it had been using.",2008-01-05
"We have always recognized that ""price stability"" was not intended to apply to a subset of prices that people paid.",2008-01-05
"However, we have also found that excluding volatile food and energy prices generally gives a better sense of underlying inflation pressures that are likely to persist and dominate total inflation over time.",2008-01-05
"Hence, core inflation has been the most useful guide to the factors affecting policy when our forecast horizon was relatively short.",2008-01-05
"FOMC members will be making their forecasts quarterly, thereby adding two rounds to the semiannual forecasts keyed to our monetary policy reports and Chairman Bernanke's testimonies.",2008-01-05
"As noted previously, our longer-term forecasts of inflation are presumably influenced by our individual assessments of what inflation rate would be acceptable and consistent with fulfilling our congressional mandates, but we chose not to ask each participant for an explicit numerical definition of price stability.",2008-01-05
We believed that the steps we were taking would provide additional information that could help clarify how we viewed price stability that at the same time would allow us to remain consistent with giving information about how we expected to fulfill our dual mandate.,2008-01-05
I expect that our new projections will provide some of the benefits of an explicit target in better anchoring inflation expectations while not giving up any flexibility to react to developments that threaten high employment.,2008-01-05
"As we gain experience with the enhanced forecasts, we will continue to evaluate how best to promote stability of both prices and employment.",2008-01-05
"When FOMC participants make their forecasts, each individual assumes ""appropriate"" monetary policy--that is, the policy that is most likely to foster the achievement of our objectives.",2008-01-05
"Forecasts made under such an assumption should better reveal the participants' views of the underlying structural parameters of the economy--the best possible tradeoffs between inflation and output stability in the short run and longer-term price and output trends--than would be made assuming an externally derived path for rates, such as the path implicit in market interest rates.",2008-01-05
"Every episode of financial turmoil is different, which greatly complicates the analysis of how the financial situation is likely to evolve in the current circumstances, how lenders and borrowers might react, and how spending and prices could be affected.",2008-01-05
"Nineteen men and women--the seven members of the Board of Governors and the Presidents of the twelve Reserve Banks--gather in Washington eight times each year to participate in FOMC deliberations on the course of monetary policy.1 If necessary, the FOMC can also convene by conference call between regularly scheduled meetings.",2005-03-30
"The FOMC's decisions are guided by the dual mandate given to the Federal Reserve by the Congress, which enjoins the Committee to use its powers to pursue both price stability and maximum sustainable employment.",2005-03-30
"To achieve its mandated objectives, the FOMC must influence the course of the U.S. economy, helping it to grow rapidly enough to make full use of available resources but not so rapidly as to stoke inflation.",2005-03-30
"The person in the street might tell you that the Fed ""controls interest rates.""",2005-03-30
"In fact, the Fed has little or no direct influence over the interest rates that matter most for the economy, such as mortgage rates, corporate bond rates, or the rates on Treasury securities.",2005-03-30
"Instead, the Fed affects these key rates, as well as the prices of financial assets such as stocks, only indirectly.",2005-03-30
"Since many of you plan to work in the financial markets, I thought that you might find it interesting to hear some of the details of how U.S. monetary policy is actually implemented and how policy decisions affect asset prices and yields.",2005-03-30
"I will begin by discussing how the Federal Reserve influences the federal funds rate, the one market interest rate over which it has fairly direct control.",2005-03-30
"I will then discuss the effects of changes in the federal funds rate on the asset prices and yields that matter the most for economic activity and inflation.2 Monetary Policy and the Federal Funds Rate Broadly speaking, the Federal Open Market Committee's principal task is to determine the degree of financial stimulus needed to steer the economy onto a desirable path and then to set monetary policy so as to provide that amount of stimulus.",2005-03-30
"""Financial stimulus"" is not a precisely measured concept, but in general, financial conditions are stimulative to the extent that the asset prices and yields prevailing in financial markets induce households and firms to spend more freely.",2005-03-30
"For example, low mortgage rates promote increased spending on new homes, low auto-financing rates tend to increase the sales of new cars, and low corporate bond yields and high stock prices generally induce firms to invest in new capital goods, such as factories and machines, at a faster pace.",2005-03-30
"When the economy is growing too sluggishly to fully employ its capital and labor resources, and if insufficient aggregate demand is the cause of slow growth, increased financial stimulus can help return the economy to full employment by expanding the aggregate demand for goods and services.",2005-03-30
"Similarly, if the economy is growing at an unsustainably quick rate, more-restrictive financial conditions (in the form of higher mortgage rates, auto financing rates, and corporate bond rates, for example) can help to restrain spending and reduce the risk of an inflationary overshoot.",2005-03-30
"Although the FOMC's ultimate objective is to provide the appropriate degree of financial stimulus to the economy, the Committee has no direct control over the key interest rates and asset prices that jointly determine the extent of financial stimulus, as I have already noted.",2005-03-30
"Instead, the FOMC's monetary policy decision is expressed in terms of the Committee's target value for an otherwise obscure short-term interest rate, the federal funds rate.",2005-03-30
"The funds rate is the interest rate prevailing in the market for borrowing and lending reserve balances, also called the federal funds market.",2005-03-30
The interest rate that banks pay when they borrow in the federal funds market is the aforementioned funds rate.,2005-03-30
"The funds rate is a market rate, not an administered rate set by fiat--that is, the funds rate is the rate needed to achieve equality between the demand for and the supply of reserves held at the Fed.",2005-03-30
"As I have already discussed, the demand for reserve balances arises both because banks must hold required reserves and because reserve balances are useful for facilitating transactions.",2005-03-30
"Because of the scale of and volatility in daily payments flows, the demand for reserve balances can vary substantially from one day to the next.",2005-03-30
Outright purchases are used to offset long-lasting changes in factors affecting the demand for and supply of reserves.,2005-03-30
"For example, long-term increases in the private sector's demand for currency have largely been met by outright purchases of securities.",2005-03-30
"In contrast, in cases in which variations in the demand for reserves or in external factors affecting reserve supply appear likely to be temporary, the Desk typically prefers to conduct open-market operations through short-term or long-term repurchase agreements, known as repos.",2005-03-30
"In the period before the millennium date change (Y2K), when the demand for currency was temporarily very high, the daily value of repos peaked at nearly $150 billion.",2005-03-30
"To hit the funds rate target, the Desk staff must forecast the daily demand for balances as well as changes in external factors affecting reserves supply.",2005-03-30
Open-market operations are then set in motion to balance the supply of and demand for reserves at the target funds rate.,2005-03-30
"Shortly after 9 a.m. each morning, the Desk staff and staff members at the Board of Governors confer over the phone to discuss their respective estimates of the day's demand for balances as well as to consider factors that may affect supply.",2005-03-30
"At 9:20 a.m., a conference call is held between the Desk staff, Board staff, and the President of a Reserve Bank.11 The Desk staff summarize the projections for reserves demand and supply, report on conditions in the federal funds market and global financial market developments, and present to the President their plans for open-market operations for his or her comment.",2005-03-30
"With a significant part of the financial system inoperative and with many payments not being made as scheduled, the banking system's demand for reserve balances rose sharply.",2005-03-30
"The Funds Rate and Other Market Rates I have discussed at some length how the Federal Reserve manages the federal funds rate, the most direct instrument of monetary policy.",2005-03-30
"As I have already hinted, however, monetary policy is effective only to the extent that Federal Reserve actions can affect a wide range of interest rates and asset prices.",2005-03-30
The interest rates most closely linked to the funds rate are those prevailing in short-term money markets.,2005-03-30
"Because large banks can trade in either the federal funds market or the Eurodollar market and because fed funds and Eurodollars are easily substitutable forms in which to hold short-term liquidity, it should not be surprising that overnight Eurodollar interest rates line up closely with the funds rate, even within the day (Bartolini, Gudell, Hilton, and Schwarz, 2005).",2005-03-30
This linkage establishes one important connection between the FOMC's target funds rate and interest rates more broadly.,2005-03-30
"As I have noted, however, to affect overall financial conditions, the FOMC's actions must affect not only very short-term rates but also longer-term yields and asset prices, including mortgage rates, corporate bond rates, and stock prices.",2005-03-30
Considerable empirical evidence suggests that monetary-policy actions do affect these longer-term yields and asset prices as well as very short-term rates.12 But what is the mechanism?,2005-03-30
"If monetary policy can affect Treasury yields, then clearly it can affect other yields and asset prices as well.",2005-03-30
"Likewise, changes in Treasury yields affect stock prices by affecting both the profit prospects of publicly traded companies as well as the rate at which expected future profits are discounted to the present.",2005-03-30
"Basic financial theory suggests that any long-term interest rate, such as a five-year or ten-year Treasury rate, is the sum of two components: a weighted average of expected short-term interest rates and a term premium, which in turn depends on risk, liquidity, and other factors affecting the desirability of the financial instrument in question.",2005-03-30
Monetary policy probably influences the term premium on Treasury securities to some extent.,2005-03-30
"13 However, in all likelihood, the more important means by which monetary policy affects Treasury yields is through the effect of policy on the expected future path of short-term interest rates, and I will focus on that channel.",2005-03-30
"Expected short-term interest rates influence long-term rates because any investor has the choice of holding either a long-term security or a series of short-term securities, re-investing his or her funds in a new short-term security as the old short-term security matures.",2005-03-30
"You may be beginning to understand at this point why making monetary policy is not a simple matter--and, in particular, why the Fed has only very indirect control over long-term yields and asset prices.",2005-03-30
"The Fed controls very short-term interest rates quite effectively, but the long-term rates that really matter for the economy depend not on the current short-term rate but on the whole trajectory of future short-term rates expected by market participants.",2005-03-30
"The FOMC's post-meeting statement, the minutes released three weeks after the meeting, and speeches and congressional testimony by the Chairman and other Federal Reserve officials all provide information to the markets and the public about the near-term economic outlook, the risks to that outlook, and the appropriate course for monetary policy.",2005-03-30

"For example, market prices on actively-traded futures contracts on the funds rate or on the Eurodollar rate tell us a great deal about the funds rate that market participants expect to prevail at various dates in the future.14 Options on fed funds and Eurodollar futures are also actively traded; the prices of these options provide useful information about the degree of uncertainty that market participants have about future monetary policy.",2005-03-30

"When the federal income tax was introduced in 1913, it included an exemption for mortgage interest payments, a provision that is a powerful stimulus to housing demand even today.",2007-08-31
The limited availability of data prior to 1929 makes it hard to quantify the role of housing in the monetary policy transmission mechanism during the early twentieth century.,2007-08-31
Comparisons are also complicated by great differences between then and now in monetary policy frameworks and tools.,2007-08-31

"Monetary policy began to focus on influencing short-term money markets as a means of affecting economic activity and inflation, foreshadowing the Federal Reserve's current use of the federal funds rate as a policy instrument.",2007-08-31
"Over the next few decades, housing assumed a leading role in the monetary transmission mechanism, largely for two reasons: Reg Q and the advent of high inflation.",2007-08-31
"The impact of disintermediation on the housing market could be quite significant; for example, a moderate tightening of monetary policy in 1966 contributed to a 23 percent decline in residential construction between the first quarter of 1966 and the first quarter of 1967.",2007-08-31
"For the period 1960 to 1982, when Reg Q assumed its greatest importance, statistical analysis shows a high correlation between single-family housing starts and the growth of small time deposits at thrifts, suggesting that disintermediation effects were powerful; in contrast, since 1983 this correlation is essentially zero.6 Economists at the time were well aware of the importance of the disintermediation phenomenon for monetary policy.",2007-08-31
"The model attributed almost one-half of the direct first-year effects of monetary policy on the real economy--which were estimated to be substantial--to disintermediation and other housing-related factors, despite the fact that residential construction accounted for only 4 percent of nominal gross domestic product (GDP) at the time.",2007-08-31
"As time went on, however, monetary policy mistakes and weaknesses in the structure of the mortgage market combined to create deeper economic problems.",2007-08-31
"For reasons that have been much analyzed, in the late 1960s and the 1970s the Federal Reserve allowed inflation to rise, which led to corresponding increases in nominal interest rates.",2007-08-31
"High inflation was also ultimately reflected in high nominal long-term rates on new mortgages, which had the effect of ""front loading"" the real payments made by holders of long-term, fixed-rate mortgages.",2007-08-31
"Reflecting these factors, housing construction experienced a series of pronounced boom and bust cycles from the early 1960s through the mid-1980s, which contributed in turn to substantial swings in overall economic growth.",2007-08-31
"These developments did not occur in time to prevent a large fraction of the thrift industry from becoming effectively insolvent by the early 1980s in the wake of the late-1970s surge in inflation.7 In this instance, the government abandoned attempts to patch up the system and instead undertook sweeping deregulation.",2007-08-31
"Importantly, the easing of some traditional institutional and regulatory frictions seems to have reduced the sensitivity of residential construction to monetary policy, so that housing is no longer so central to monetary transmission as it was.8 In particular, in the absence of Reg Q ceilings on deposit rates and with a much-reduced role for deposits as a source of housing finance, the availability of mortgage credit today is generally less dependent on conditions in short-term money markets, where the central bank operates most directly.",2007-08-31
"Most estimates suggest that, because of the reduced sensitivity of housing to short-term interest rates, the response of the economy to a given change in the federal funds rate is modestly smaller and more balanced across sectors than in the past.9 These results are embodied in the Federal Reserve's large econometric model of the economy, which implies that only about 14 percent of the overall response of output to monetary policy is now attributable to movements in residential investment, in contrast to the model's estimate of 25 percent or so under what I have called the New Deal system.",2007-08-31
"In contrast, residential investment boosted overall real GDP growth during the 2001 recession.",2007-08-31
"But, of course, housing may have indirect effects on economic activity, most notably by influencing consumer spending.",2007-08-31
"This smoothing in turn should reduce the dependence of their spending on current income, which, by limiting the power of conventional multiplier effects, should tend to increase macroeconomic stability and reduce the effects of a given change in the short-term interest rate.",2007-08-31
"These inferences are supported by some empirical evidence.10 On the other hand, the increased liquidity of home equity may lead consumer spending to respond more than in past years to changes in the values of their homes; some evidence does suggest that the correlation of consumption and house prices is higher in countries, like the United States, that have more sophisticated mortgage markets (Calza, Monacelli, and Stracca, 2007).",2007-08-31
Conclusion I hope this exploration of the history of housing finance has persuaded you that institutional factors can matter quite a bit in determining the influence of monetary policy on housing and the role of housing in the business cycle.,2007-08-31

"Exchange rates for the dollar with respect to major currencies were fixed in a system in which the United States enjoyed the ""exorbitant privilege"" of being the reserve currency.",2005-10-11
"In effect, the United States was the ""nth"" country in the global economic system, meaning that U.S. economic preeminence implied that policy--including monetary policy--could be set essentially independently of the global economy; our trading partners would have to react to the downstream consequences of U.S. developments.",2005-10-11
"The recovery of our trading partners from World War II, the development of more-sophisticated financial markets, the growth of trade, and the desires of other countries to pursue policies independent from those of the United States strained to the breaking point the exchange rate system put in place at the end of the war.",2005-10-11
"In the early 1970s, we shifted from fixed exchange rates under the Bretton Woods system to the present arrangements, in which the dollar's value against major currencies is set by market forces.",2005-10-11
"Swings in business cycles abroad, disruptions to the supply of imported goods like oil, and variations in exchange rates have left their imprint on the U.S. economy over the past thirty years.",2005-10-11
"In the late 1990s, for example, financial crises in Asia, Latin America, and Russia created serious disturbances in the global financial system, posing new challenges for U.S. monetary policy makers.",2005-10-11
"For example, a change in domestic demand should have a smaller effect on gross domestic product, employment, and prices in an open economy than in a closed one because some of its effect will fall on imports--through changes in income or the dollar's exchange rate, or both.",2005-10-11
Perhaps the most consequential development for monetary policy was the shift to more-flexible exchange rates.,2005-10-11
This shift both lifted the constraint of defending the exchange rate and strengthened the effect of policy actions.,2005-10-11
"According to the textbooks, when exchange rates can move, easier monetary policy--lower interest rates--should stimulate demand by depreciating the currency and boosting net exports as well as by reducing the cost of borrowing domestically.",2005-10-11
"Similarly, tighter policy should restrain demand and hold down prices through an appreciation of the currency in addition to raising interest rates.",2005-10-11
"Admittedly, the exchange rate channel does not always work this way in practice; among other things, exchange rates also depend on trade and current account balances and on what is happening in the economies of our trading partners; and currency values respond more to the expected pattern of interest rates here and abroad than to the current short-term rates that central banks control.",2005-10-11
"These factors mean that the exchange rate sometimes moves in surprising directions, complicating monetary policy.",2005-10-11
"Furthermore, the exchange rate channel can amplify the effects of mistaken policies--for example, the dollar may fall and add to domestic inflation pressures if the stance of policy is overly accommodative.",2005-10-11
"It took central banks some time to learn to operate successfully without the anchor of a fixed exchange rate, and partly for this reason inflation soared in the 1970s while economic activity stagnated.",2005-10-11
"As central banks and governments came to recognize the critical importance of long-term price stability, inflation subsequently subsided.",2005-10-11
"The fall in inflation coincided with a step-up in the pace of global economic integration, including in the past decade or more the increasing involvement of those economies in Asia and elsewhere.",2005-10-11
"The question is whether that development has affected overall inflation and employment in industrial countries, and thus whether it may have changed the setting of monetary policy needed to maintain price stability and sustained high employment.",2005-10-11
The Implications for Inflation I have been struck recently by the contrast between the views reported in the media and views among academic economists on this issue of globalization and inflation.,2005-10-11
"The media tend to concentrate on the increasing availability of cheap goods and competitive pressures on labor compensation as a continuing, pervasive check on inflationary tendencies in industrial economies.",2005-10-11
"In contrast, just two weeks ago, I attended a conference of leading academic and central bank researchers on inflation hosted by the Federal Reserve Board, at which globalization was hardly mentioned.",2005-10-11
"One modeler had tacked an import price variable onto the equations explaining U.S. inflation, but the rest simply ignored any developments beyond our borders.",2005-10-11
"For a monetary policy practitioner, this disconnect raises a puzzle and some very basic concerns.",2005-10-11
"A possible implication of the view in the media is that the inflation penalty for allowing economies to run a little ""hotter"" than normal--that is, a bit beyond an economic long-run sustainable output--could be quite small, if there is any penalty at all.",2005-10-11
"The academic view implies that for the most part I can proceed with regard to inflation as if the United States is, to a first approximation, a closed economy.",2005-10-11
The advance of globalization has increased the range of goods and services available to be imported by U.S. households and firms and reduced the prices of many imported goods and services.,2005-10-11
"In the case of consumer goods, these developments have directly held down the rate of increase of the imported-goods component of the consumer price index (CPI) and, thus, the rate of increase of the overall index; this direct effect on CPI inflation has risen over time as the import share of household spending has increased.",2005-10-11
"Beyond this effect, falling prices for imported materials as well as capital equipment have reduced the production costs of U.S. firms, thereby indirectly restraining the growth of prices of domestically produced goods and services.",2005-10-11
Globalization has reinforced disinflation by intensifying the competitive pressures faced by U.S. firms and workers.,2005-10-11
"For some firms, the actual or potential availability of less-expensive foreign goods has squeezed profit margins and may have intensified the firms' search for cost-saving productivity enhancements.",2005-10-11
"For workers in some sectors, labor compensation has likely been restrained by the threat of jobs being shifted overseas to take advantage of lower production costs in the new trading nations, and this wage restraint in turn has helped to hold down domestic prices.",2005-10-11
How important have these direct and indirect price effects been?,2005-10-11
"A precise answer to this question is beyond our abilities, but we can try to get a handle on the likely magnitude by using a simple reduced-form inflation equation of the sort employed by the Board's staff as an input into its inflation forecasts.",2005-10-11
"This equation relates inflation to, among other factors, lagged inflation, resource utilization, and movements in the relative price of imports excluding energy, semiconductors, and computers.",2005-10-11
"With it, we can simulate how core consumer prices would have been expected to evolve over the past ten years if relative import prices had remained constant--that is, had import prices gone up in line with those of domestically produced goods rather than rising approximately 1 percent per year slower on average, as actually occurred.",2005-10-11
The arithmetic of this exercise suggests that the decline in import prices since the mid-1990s has shaved between 1/2 and 1 percentage point off core inflation over the past ten years.,2005-10-11
Some of the historical decline in import prices was probably driven by movements in the dollar's exchange rate largely unrelated to the growing integration of world markets.,2005-10-11
"For example, the dollar rose strongly in the second half of the 1990s, when investment was attracted here by a pickup in productivity growth and profits.",2005-10-11
"And relative import prices would have been likely to decline even in the absence of increased globalization, given the dominant role in trade of manufacturing, in which technological advances have put important restraint on prices.",2005-10-11
"On the basis of these considerations, the contribution of globalization to low inflation in the United States in recent years has probably been appreciably smaller than the simple model simulation might suggest--although not necessarily inconsequential.",2005-10-11
"In this regard, although direct empirical studies of the effect of an individual country's export prices on the United States are scarce, one recent study by the Board's staff concluded that lower prices of Chinese imports have had at most only modest effects on U.S. prices in recent years, although more-significant effects were recorded in a few specific categories.2 In addition, a focus on past declines in the prices of imported products is only part of the story of the effects of globalization on inflation in this country.",2005-10-11
Globalization and the integration of the newly emerging market economies have implications for the demand for goods and services as well as for their supply.,2005-10-11
"Perhaps more consequentially, as trade theory, trade models, and recent experience suggest is likely to occur, new global traders are adding significant demand as well--especially for energy, basic commodities, and capital goods.",2005-10-11
"For example, between 2000 and 2004, increases in Chinese steel consumption are estimated to have accounted for two-thirds of the increase in global steel demand.",2005-10-11
"In fact, historically, industrializing countries have often raised global demand more than supply.",2005-10-11
"Their trade accounts tend to be in surplus, in some cases substantially, an indication that they are supplying more goods into the global economy than they are demanding.",2005-10-11
"Over time, one would expect the national savings surpluses of these newly integrating economies to decrease or even turn into deficits as opportunities to invest at home come to seem more profitable than placing savings abroad and as the desire of their residents to consume their rising wealth intensifies.",2005-10-11
"Rising exchange rates, reflecting increasing productivity and real incomes, would help to reduce the countries' trade surpluses in two ways: Exports to industrial economies would no longer enjoy as large a price advantage and, obviously, would exert less downward pressure on inflation in those economies; and the demand for imports by the developing countries would rise.",2005-10-11
"For a variety of reasons, some emerging-market economies have resisted upward pressures on their exchange rates, even if that resistance requires buying large quantities of dollars to keep their currencies from appreciating.",2005-10-11
"But changes in exchange rates will be helpful in enabling them to adapt to rapidly changing internal and external developments while maintaining economic stability, and their recognition of that advantage should continue to lead to greater flexibility.",2005-10-11
"Meanwhile, less than fully flexible exchange rates are probably contributing to the surpluses of these economies and to their disinflationary effect on the rest of the world.",2005-10-11
"Taking all these factors into account, where do I come out on the question of how recent trends in globalization have affected inflation in the United States and other industrial countries?",2005-10-11
"On balance, under current circumstances, the entry of China, India, and others into the global trading system is probably having a modest disinflationary effect here.",2005-10-11
"If some fundamental conditioning factors were to change--for example, if these countries' exchange rates were to rise and their demand to increase--different spending patterns that could reduce the degree of downward pressure on prices might emerge.",2005-10-11
"In fact, we cannot rule out the possibility that globalization might some day even create inflationary pressures on balance.",2005-10-11
"The Implications for Productivity, Potential Output, and the NAIRU If globalization is having a modest but persistent downward effect on U.S. inflation, what about its effects on employment, the other component of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate?",2005-10-11
This job-worker mismatch might for a time tend to raise the economy's sustainable nonaccelerating-inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU).,2005-10-11
"As a result, the aggregate labor market readily absorbs such disruptions as those from trade, leaving overall employment little affected.",2005-10-11
"That we now have an unemployment rate as low as 5 percent, and have sustained that rate without an appreciable pickup of underlying inflation, is evidence that our economy's ability to provide jobs on a sustained basis has not been impaired.",2005-10-11
"Although globalization should have little effect on aggregate employment and the NAIRU, international trade does expand the economy's productive potential.",2005-10-11
"By enabling a country to concentrate on producing those goods and services in which it is most efficient, an expansion of trade boosts the productivity of domestic labor and capital, permanently raising the level of potential output.",2005-10-11
"Moreover, the heightened competitive environment fostered by an increasingly global trading system, as I noted earlier, may force firms to be more innovative, further boosting the level, and perhaps even the growth rate, of productivity.",2005-10-11
"The expansion in aggregate supply and national income implied by these forces in turn leads to a corresponding rise in aggregate demand; in particular, households are able to increase their standard of living by consuming more goods and services, both imported and domestic.",2005-10-11
And it is the balance between potential supply and aggregate demand that concerns monetary policy.,2005-10-11
The Implications for Monetary Policy Globalization in its latest manifestations does not relieve central banks of their responsibility for maintaining price and economic stability.,2005-10-11
"Inflation can be affected by a number of factors in the short run, but over time it will be determined by the interactions of aggregate demand, potential supply, and the expectations of businesses and households about future inflation.",2005-10-11
"Through their control over the amount of bank reserves in the financial system and short-term interest rates, central banks can influence the balance of demand and potential supply, and their actions may also have direct effects on inflation expectations over time.",2005-10-11
"Over the long run, the central bank has full responsibility for determining the economy's average rate of inflation.",2005-10-11
"How the forces of demand, potential supply, and expectations interact has probably not been changed in any fundamental way by the recent trend of globalization.",2005-10-11
"To be sure, the integration of newly industrializing economies into the global trading system is exerting downward pressure on costs and prices.",2005-10-11
"But the effect on inflation--the rate of change in prices--has probably not been large to date, and the extent and duration of its damping influence on inflation in the future are open questions.",2005-10-11
"Inflation will still rise if central banks allow economies to run ""too hot""--beyond sustainable potential--and such a pickup could become self-perpetuating if it became embedded in inflation expectations.",2005-10-11
"True, the specialization and efficiencies resulting from expanding trade enlarge potential supply by increasing productivity, enabling an increase in actual consumption and investment.",2005-10-11
And this integration could manifest itself in the interest rates the Federal Reserve needs to implement to keep the economy growing at its potential.,2005-10-11
"The result has been lower interest rates here along with a stronger dollar, as well as a larger U.S. current account deficit than probably could have been sustained fifteen or twenty years ago.",2005-10-11
"In one sense, an open economy may be more forgiving as shortfalls or excesses in demand are partly absorbed by other countries through adjustments of our imports and exports.",2005-10-11
"To the extent that the U.S. can more readily draw upon world capacity, the inflationary effect of an increase in aggregate demand might be damped.",2005-10-11
"For example, if financial market participants thought that the Federal Reserve were not dedicated to maintaining long-run price stability, they would be less willing to hold dollar-denominated assets and the resulting decline in the exchange value of the dollar would tend to add to inflationary pressures.",2005-10-11
The need to compete for business in a globalized economy has quite likely raised the efficiency and flexibility of economic systems as well as reinforcing the requirement for noninflationary monetary policies.,2005-10-11
Globalization is a powerful force that raises productivity and living standards.,2005-10-11
"I will touch on some of the banking issues I expect are on your minds, but one of the biggest issues for everyone right now is inflation, what the Fed is doing to get inflation under control, and the implications for your businesses, your customers, and your communities.",2022-06-23
Inflation is the highest we have seen in the United States in 40 years and so far it shows little sign of moderating.,2022-06-23
"That tightness is contributing to inflation, because labor is the largest input cost for producing goods and providing services.",2022-06-23
"Inflation is a significant challenge for everyone, but it hits lower- and moderate-income people the hardest, since they spend a larger share of their incomes on necessities and often have less savings to fall back on.",2022-06-23
Inflation is also a burden for businesses that must somehow balance unpredictable costs while setting prices that aren't so high that they discourage customers from purchasing.,2022-06-23
Inflation that continues at these levels is a threat to sustained employment growth and to the overall health of the economy.,2022-06-23
"The inflation data show that, after moderating slightly for a short time, price increases for motor vehicles have picked up again, energy prices rose sharply in May, and prices for food have risen more than 10 percent from a year ago.",2022-06-23
"The inflationary effect from the invasion of Ukraine has proven to be lasting for both energy and food commodity prices, with little prospect of the conflict or those price pressures abating very soon.",2022-06-23
One important factor that we often point to in driving today's spending decisions and inflation outlook are expectations of future inflation.,2022-06-23
"Near-term expectations tend to rise as current inflation increases, but when inflation expectations over the longer-termâ€”the next 5 to 10 yearsâ€”begin to rise, it may indicate that consumers and businesses have less confidence in the Fed's ability to address higher inflation and return it to the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) goal of 2 percent.",2022-06-23
"If expectations move significantly above our 2 percent goal, it would make it more difficult to change people's perceptions about the duration of high inflation and potentially more difficult to get inflation under control.",2022-06-23
"As we see surveys like the Michigan survey report higher longer-term inflation expectations, we need to pay close attention and continue to use our tools to address inflation before these indicators rise further or expectations of higher inflation become entrenched.",2022-06-23
"As I mentioned earlier, one force driving inflation is the extremely tight labor market.",2022-06-23
"Even with these gains, wages have not kept pace with inflation, which has made it much more difficult for many workers to make ends meet in the face of soaring housing, energy, and food costs.",2022-06-23
"Job creation signals strong labor market demand, particularly in the current environment, with a large number of available jobs and fewer job seekers.",2022-06-23
"While the strong job market has brought some of these workers back into the workforce, it seems that many are still waiting or may not return, meaning that labor shortages will likely persist in many sectors of the economy.",2022-06-23
"I've laid out many of the challenges, so now let me talk about what the Federal Reserve is doing to get inflation under control.",2022-06-23
"In the face of inflation that continues to be much too high and in light of the recent high readings, the FOMC raised the federal funds rate by 75 basis points at our most recent meeting last week.",2022-06-23
"On June 1, the Fed took a separate step to tighten monetary policy by beginning to reduce its large balance sheet of securities holdings.",2022-06-23
"I strongly supported the FOMC's decision last week, and I expect to support additional rate increases until we see significant progress toward bringing inflation down.",2022-06-23
"Based on current inflation readings, I expect that an additional rate increase of 75 basis points will be appropriate at our next meeting as well as increases of at least 50 basis points in the next few subsequent meetings, as long as the incoming data support them.",2022-06-23
"The case for further rate hikes is made stronger by the current level of the ""real"" federal funds rate, which is the difference between the nominal rate and near-term inflation expectations.",2022-06-23
"With inflation much higher than the federal funds rate, the real federal funds rate is negative, even after our rate increases this year.",2022-06-23
"Since inflation is unacceptably high, it doesn't make sense to have the nominal federal funds rate below near-term inflation expectations.",2022-06-23
"While I expect that the labor market will remain strong as the FOMC continues to tighten monetary policy, these actions do not come without risk.",2022-06-23
"But in my view, our number one responsibility is to reduce inflation.",2022-06-23
Maintaining our commitment to restore price stability is the best course to support a sustainably strong labor market.,2022-06-23
"The Fed's credibility, earned over decades of low inflation, is a powerful policy tool that is critical to our long-term success.",2022-06-23
"As a step toward that goal, I also supported the Committee's action to begin reducing the Fed's balance sheet, which is providing unneeded economic stimulus making inflation worse.",2022-06-23
"In closing, I know that inflation, and our efforts to lower it, may present challenges for banks.",2022-06-23
"The first session on your agenda this morning discussed interest rate risk, and I would be interested to learn how you are managing this risk so far and what you expect as the year progresses.",2022-06-23
The framing of this topic raises the question of whether low interest rates have somehow undermined the stability and functioning of the financial system.,2017-01-07
"I will argue that ""low for long"" interest rates have supported slow but steady progress to full employment and stable prices, which has in turn supported financial stability.",2017-01-07
And low rates can lead to excessive leverage and broadly unsustainable asset prices--things that we watch carefully for and do not observe at this point.,2017-01-07
I will begin by focusing briefly on the macroeconomic effects of low interest rates.,2017-01-07
"Highly Accommodative Monetary Policy The financial crisis and the Great Recession posed the most significant macroeconomic challenges for the United States in a half-century, leaving behind high unemployment and below-target inflation and calling for highly accommodative monetary policies.",2017-01-07
"Isolating the effects of these policies is challenging, but studies generally show that they lowered rates across the curve and moved other asset prices as well.1 It is even more challenging to evaluate their effects on aggregate demand.",2017-01-07
Low rates and higher asset prices should support household and business spending and investment through various channels.,2017-01-07
"And low rates have clearly not produced a boom in corporate investment, although standard accelerator models suggest that investment has largely been consistent with the weak pace of economic growth.",2017-01-07
"Nonetheless, there is good reason to think that low rates have provided significant support for demand, and my view is that they have done so.2 As you can see in slide 1, we are now close to meeting our dual mandate--a reasonable summary statistic for the effects of policy.",2017-01-07
"While growth has been frustratingly slow, employment gains have been solid.",2017-01-07
Other Factors Are Holding Down Rates There are also many factors other than monetary policy that are holding down long-term interest rates.,2017-01-07
"The next slide decomposes long-term nominal yields into expected future short-term real rates, expected future inflation, and a term premium.",2017-01-07
"The downward trend in nominal term premiums likely reflects both lower inflation risk and the fact that, with inflation expectations anchored, nominal bonds have become an increasingly good hedge against market risk.",2017-01-07
"That has made bonds a more attractive investment and reduced the term premium.4 As shown in the next slide, a regression of the 10-year term premium on measures of 10-year inflation expectations and a rolling beta of Treasury returns with respect to equity returns (to proxy for the hedging value of bonds) shows that these two factors can account for a large part of the decline in the term premium.",2017-01-07
"Global factors may have put downward pressure on term premiums because of anxiety about the foreign outlook, which may have increased demand for U.S. assets, or because low rates abroad have depressed U.S. term premiums through a global portfolio balance channel.5 And real rates are quite low globally, reflecting the step-down of productivity growth over the past 10 years as well as shifts in savings and investment demand due to demographic change.6 The Core of the Financial System Is Much Stronger Before turning to the interplay between low rates and the financial system, I will simply point out that both improved risk management at the largest, most systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) and stronger regulation have made the core of the system much stronger and more resilient than before the crisis.7 The SIFIs have more stable funding, hold much more capital and liquidity, are more conscious of their risks, and are far more resolvable should they fail.",2017-01-07
"Low Rates Can Mean Tradeoffs So far, I have argued that low rates have supported aggregate demand and brought us very close to full employment and 2 percent inflation; that forces other than monetary policy have been pushing rates lower for more than 30 years; and that the core of the financial system is now much stronger and more resilient than before the crisis.",2017-01-07
"All of that said, I would also agree that monetary policy may sometimes face tradeoffs between macroeconomic objectives and financial stability.",2017-01-07
"For example, the Fed's initial unconventional policies supported both market functioning and aggregate demand.",2017-01-07
"More broadly, post-crisis monetary policy supported asset values, reduced interest payments, and increased both employment and income.",2017-01-07
"Low-for-long interest rates can have adverse effects on financial institutions and markets through a number of plausible channels, as listed on the next slide.8 After all, low interest rates are intended to encourage some risk-taking.9The question is whether low rates have encouraged excessive risk-taking through the buildup of leverage or unsustainably high asset prices or through misallocation of capital.",2017-01-07
"Historically, recessions often occurred when the Fed tightened to control inflation.",2017-01-07
"More recently, with inflation under control, overheating has shown up in the form of financial excess.",2017-01-07
Core PCE inflation remained close to or below 2 percent during both the late-1990s stock market bubble and the mid-2000s housing bubble that led to the financial crisis.,2017-01-07
"If we look at the channels listed here, the picture is mixed, but the bottom line is that there has not been an excessive buildup of leverage, maturity transformation, or broadly unsustainable asset prices.",2017-01-07
"Low long-term interest rates have weighed on profitability in the financial sector, although firms have so far coped with those pressures.",2017-01-07
"Equity prices have recently increased considerably, pushing the forward price-earnings ratio further above its historical median (slide).",2017-01-07
"High-risk corporate debt (the sum of high-yield bonds and leveraged loans) grew rapidly in 2013 and 2014 (slide), although growth has declined sharply since then.11 However, firms also are holding high levels of liquid assets, so net leverage is not elevated.",2017-01-07
"Low interest rates have encouraged risk-taking and higher leverage in some sectors and have weighed on profitability in others, but the areas where there are signs of excess are isolated.",2017-01-07
"Conclusion To sum up, low interest rates have supported economic activity and gradually brought us back to full employment and 2 percent inflation.",2017-01-07

"October 12, 2021 U.S. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the 2021 Institute of International Finance Annual Membership Meeting: Sustainable Economic Growth and Financial Stability in a Diverging, Decarbonizing, Digitizing, Indebted World, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share It is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today at the 2021 Institute of International Finance Annual Membership Meeting.1 I regret that we are not meeting in person, but I look forward, as always, to a conversation with my good friend and one-time colleague Tim Adams.",2021-10-12
"But first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook and Federal Reserve monetary policy.",2021-10-12
Current Economic Situation and Outlook Indicators of economic activity and employment reveal that the economy continues to strengthen.,2021-10-12
"Real gross domestic product (GDP) rose at a strong 6.4 percent pace in the first half of the year, and growth is widely expected to continue at a robust, if perhaps somewhat slower, pace in the second half of the year.",2021-10-12
"If so, GDP growth this calendar year could be the fastest since 1983.",2021-10-12
"That said, the data also indicate that a surge in COVID-19 cases in the summer and supply-chain bottlenecks held back economic activity in the third quarter.",2021-10-12
"As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have continued to improve.",2021-10-12
"Labor market progress this year, as measured by the Kansas City Fed's Labor Market Conditions Indicators, has been notable, with this index of 24 labor market indicators since December 2020 closing two-thirds of its shortfall relative to its pre-pandemic level.2 Nonetheless, factors related to the pandemic, such as caregiving obligations and ongoing fears of the virus, continue to weigh on employment and participation.",2021-10-12
"Since February 2020, core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) price inflation is running at a 2.9 percent annual pace that is well above what I would consider to be a moderate overshoot of our 2 percent longer-run goal for inflation.",2021-10-12
"In particular, the reopening has been characterized by significant sectoral shifts in both aggregate demand and supply, and these shifts are causing widespread bottlenecks and triggering substantial changes in the relative price and wage structure of the economy.",2021-10-12
"As these relative price adjustments work their way through the economy, measured inflation rises.",2021-10-12
"But I continue to believe that the underlying rate inflation in the U.S. economy is hovering close to our 2 percent longer-run objective and, thus, that the unwelcome surge in inflation this year, once these relative price adjustments are complete and bottlenecks have unclogged, will in the end prove to be largely transitory.",2021-10-12
"That said, I believe, as do most of my colleagues, that the risks to inflation are to the upside, and I continue to be attuned and attentive to underlying inflation trends, in particular measures of inflation expectations, including the Board staff's index of common inflation expectations.3 As Chair Powell has indicated, if we did see indicators of inflation expectations moving up and running persistently above levels consistent with our price stability mandate, monetary policy would react to that.",2021-10-12
"Since our December 2020 meeting, the Committee has indicated that it will continue to maintain the pace of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities purchases at $80 billion and $40 billion per month, respectively, until ""substantial further progress"" has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.4 At our September meeting, the Committee continued to discuss the progress made toward these goals, and I myself believe that the ""substantial further progress"" standard has more than been met with regard to our price-stability mandate and has all but been met with regard to our employment mandate.",2021-10-12
"As we reaffirmed in September, we continue to expect that it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessment of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.",2021-10-12
"Rather than grapple with the definition of the rather slippery concept of liquidity in my short remarks here, I will focus on aspects of global financial markets that many analysts associate with liquidity and that are particularly relevant for monetary policy--namely, the relatively low level of long-term interest rates in both real and nominal terms and the resulting relatively flat slope of yield curves around the world.1 I want to emphasize that, given the openness of capital markets, explanations of these phenomena should have an international component.",2007-03-09
"I will argue that the flatness of the term structure reflects both the global balance of saving and investment, through its effect on real interest rates, and currency competition, through its effect on expected inflation and inflation risk.",2007-03-09
We know that the short end of the yield curve is dominated by monetary policy and cyclical factors.,2007-03-09
"To abstract from the potential effects of cyclical factors on the yield curve, consider the pattern of forward rates many years into the future, at which point the effects of current cyclical shocks would be expected to no longer be important.2 Such forward rates reflect not only market expectations of future short-term interest rates but also term premiums to compensate for the risk associated with commitments to extend credit so far in the future, including the risk of future inflation.",2007-03-09
"The resulting strength of demand has kept real long-term interest rates lower than they might otherwise have been in many countries, and particularly in the United States because it is a relatively attractive place to invest.",2007-03-09
"I will emphasize three significant changes in most countries around the world that point to a reduction in the compensation required by investors for the possible effects of future inflation on the returns to holding long-term bonds: Namely, declines in (1) actual inflation, (2) inflation volatility, and (3) expectations of long-term inflation, both survey based and ""market based.""",2007-03-09
"What I have elsewhere referred to as ""currency competition"" may be a driving force behind these changes in inflation outcomes and expectations and may be reflected in low nominal long-term interest rates and the flattening of yield curves.5 Iâ€™d like to briefly review what I mean by currency competition.",2007-03-09
"A confluence of four factors--deregulation, globalization, financial innovation, and the publicâ€™s increased understanding of the costs of inflation--has fostered a form of competition among currencies.",2007-03-09
"That competition, in turn, has led to improved central bank performance and thereby contributed to the recent conquest of worldwide inflation.",2007-03-09
"Prompted in part by the collapse of central planning, many countries have turned increasingly to private markets and trade to deliver growth and progress.",2007-03-09
"As a result, deregulation, globalization, and innovation have made it easier for citizens to move their wealth out of nominal assets in their local currency and thereby avoid any inflation tax should their government show signs that it might resort to inflationary tactics to finance spending.6 At the same time, the publicâ€™s understanding of the costs of inflation has increased, in part because of experiences of high inflation in many countries in the 1980s.",2007-03-09
"Almost everywhere, public opinion eventually turned against allowing inflation to continue.",2007-03-09
This public pressure has reinforced the trend against inflationary policies.,2007-03-09
"Increased competition among currencies, driven by the confluence of factors that I just described, has improved central bank performance by changing the ability and the incentives of governments and central banks to pursue high-inflation policies.",2007-03-09
"In effect, currency competition has raised the costs of poor policy and thus promoted central bank incentives to maintain low inflation.",2007-03-09
This change has led many governments to be more willing to adopt institutional changes to improve central bank governance that have bolstered central bank credibility for maintaining low inflation.,2007-03-09
"Such changes have included greater central bank independence, which has typically been granted in conjunction with a mandate including the achievement of low and stable inflation as one of the goals of monetary policy.",2007-03-09
"When citizens are more aware of the costs of inflation, and when governments are less able to reap benefits from high inflation, institutional reforms that make central banks more credible and independent are more likely to be adopted and sustained.7 Let me make it clear that I think that currency competition has been a much larger force in emerging-market economies, in which the costs of poor policies have been demonstrated quite clearly, than in advanced economies.",2007-03-09
The forces behind currency competition that have bolstered incentives for central banks to maintain low inflation and so have helped anchor inflation expectations are likely to persist and perhaps strengthen.,2007-03-09
"At the same time, trend U.S. productivity growth appears to have risen to its highest rate since the 1970s.",1999-09-21
"But although information technology is available, at least in theory, to the whole world, the recent surge in productivity growth appears to have been stronger in the United States than elsewhere, including the other industrialized countries.",1999-09-21
"This raises the interesting questions of what else besides simple availability is needed to translate the promise of information technology into real productivity gains, and whether--whatever it is--the United States has more of it?",1999-09-21
"These questions are impossible to answer with precision, so the purpose of my talk this afternoon is to identify particular features of the American economy that might contribute to an especially hospitable climate for translating the potential gains from information technology into actual productivity growth.",1999-09-21
"The recent technical advances represent a continuation of a long string of fundamental leaps in technology that have worked their way through the economic system over many years, boosting productivity growth in the process, but how long a particular innovation has a beneficial effect on productivity growth is difficult to say.",1999-09-21
History demonstrates that the boost to productivity growth from a particular technological advance is not unlimited and eventually will be fully exploited.,1999-09-21
"Just as ""trees do not grow to the sky,"" so, too, increases in the rate of productivity growth from any given advance are not without limits.",1999-09-21
"Search engines have cut the time needed to track down a person or an item to a fraction of amount previously required, clearly raising productivity.",1999-09-21
"In fact, as productivity growth slowed in the 1970s and continued to languish in the 1980s, many observers wondered whether the supposed benefits of cheaper and more powerful computers would ever be realized.",1999-09-21
"For instance, Paul David, a Stanford University economist, notes that electric motors did not boost productivity growth appreciably until more than forty years after Edison installed the first dynamo in 1881.",1999-09-21
"In recent years, aggressive cost-cutting in the United States has been linked to greater emphasis on maximization of shareholder value and less on growth and diversification, which was more prominent in the 1970s and 1980s.",1999-09-21
"If the trend continues and other countries move further toward the U.S. model, it will be interesting to see whether improvements in productivity growth follow.",1999-09-21
"Although much European regulation has been directed at saving jobs, it can be argued, in fact, to have had the opposite effect in the aggregate, as evidenced by the marked upward drift in continental European unemployment rates over the past two to three decades.",1999-09-21
"It is also noteworthy that the unemployment rate differential is particularly large in younger age groups; youth unemployment rates were around 30 percent in 1997 in France and Italy, for example.",1999-09-21
The evidence suggests that new technology often results in more growth in employment in innovating industries.,1999-09-21
"However, it also tends to shift demand from unskilled to more highly skilled workers, potentially displacing unskilled workers in the process.",1999-09-21
It is axiomatic that in a truly flexible labor market everyone who wants a job can find one--at some price.,1999-09-21
"As technical change increases demand for skilled relative to unskilled labor, the unskilled workers must acquire new skills, find new jobs at lower relative wages, or become unemployed.",1999-09-21
"OECD data suggest that the United States and Canada have been more successful than the other industrialized countries in achieving these adjustments and, therefore, in maintaining aggregate employment growth on a par with labor force growth in the face of differential rates of job growth by occupations.",1999-09-21
"White-collar, high-skilled employment increased at a much faster rate than employment in the other categories in nearly all cases in the G-7 countries over 1979-95.",1999-09-21
"In the United States and Canada, white-collar, low-skilled employment also rose at healthy rates, while blue-collar employment was little changed.",1999-09-21
"In contrast, blue-collar employment fell sharply in most of the other countries.",1999-09-21
A cross-country comparison of macroeconomic performance in terms of productivity growth and utilization of resources with the OECD's index of the overall regulatory environment suggests that a country's performance does improve as the regulatory environment becomes less restrictive.,1999-09-21
"Evidence on patents (one measure of innovation) and measures of productivity suggests that those countries that have extensively liberalized (such as Japan, the United Kingdom, Finland, and the United States) have experienced greater innovation and larger gains in efficiency.",1999-09-21
"For instance, both growth in cellular phone usage and the penetration rate for Internet hosts is much higher in more-competitive market structures.",1999-09-21
"From a broader perspective, productivity growth is obviously not society's only priority--worker health and safety, pollution control, and other societal values are important as well.",1999-09-21
"Although it has been argued that regulations requiring mandated approaches to pollution reduction or worker safety tend to divert managerial energies from pursuing cost-reducing innovations, studies have shown that some regulatory changes can in fact enhance productivity by forcing a firm to develop new and more-efficient production techniques.",1999-09-21
"In particular, venture capital markets here are both more developed and more geared to financing higher-risk projects, mainly in technology-based sectors by start-ups with prospects of rapid growth.",1999-09-21
I might add that the current low inflation environment also helps this process.,1999-09-21
"In the presence of subdued inflation expectations, the first inclination of firms in the face of rising demand for their output, thus far at least, appears not to have been to raise prices but rather to find ways to expand output via more-efficient means of production.",1999-09-21

"January 08, 2021 U.S. Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the C. Peter McColough Series on International Economics Council on Foreign Relations, New York, New York (via webcast) Share It is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today at the Council on Foreign Relations.1 I regret that we are not doing this session in person, as we did last year, and I hope the next time I am back, we will be gathering together in New York City again.",2021-01-08
"I look forward to my conversation with Steve Liesman and to your questions, but first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and our new monetary policy framework.",2021-01-08
"Economic activity rebounded robustly in the third quarter and has continued to recover in the fourth quarter from its depressed second-quarter level, though the pace of improvement has moderated.",2021-01-08
"Household spending on goods, especially durable goods, has been strong and has moved above its pre-pandemic level, supported in part by federal stimulus payments and expanded unemployment benefits.",2021-01-08
"Inflation, following large declines in the spring of 2020, picked up over the summer but has leveled out more recently; for those sectors that have been most adversely affected by the pandemic, price increases remain subdued.",2021-01-08
"While gross domestic product growth in the fourth quarter downshifted from the once-in-a-century 33 percent annualized rate of growth reported in the third quarter, it is clear that since the spring of 2020, the economy has turned out to be more resilient in adapting to the virus, and more responsive to monetary and fiscal policy support, than many predicted.",2021-01-08
"Indeed, it is worth highlighting that in the baseline projections of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) summarized in the latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), most of my colleagues and I revised up our outlook for the economy over the medium term, projecting a relatively rapid return to levels of employment and inflation consistent with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate as compared with the recovery from the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).2 In particular, the median FOMC participant projects that by the end of 2023â€”a little less than three years from nowâ€”the unemployment rate will have fallen below 4 percent, and PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation will have returned to 2 percent.",2021-01-08
"Following the GFC, it took more than eight years for employment and inflation to return to similar mandate-consistent levels.",2021-01-08
"Although a little more than half of participants judged risks to be broadly balanced for economic activity, a similar number continued to see risks weighted to the downside for inflation.",2021-01-08
"The Latest FOMC Decision and the New Monetary Policy Framework At our most recent FOMC meetings, the Committee made important changes to our policy statement that upgraded our forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate and asset purchases, and that also provided unprecedented information about our policy reaction function.",2021-01-08
"As announced in the September statement and reiterated in November and December, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, our policy will aim to achieve inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal.3 We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomesâ€”as well as our maximum-employment mandateâ€”are achieved.",2021-01-08
"We also expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.",2021-01-08
"In addition, in the December statement, we combined our forward guidance for the federal fund rate with enhanced, outcome-based guidance about our asset purchases.",2021-01-08
We indicated that we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and our holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.,2021-01-08
"The changes to the policy statement that we made over the fall bring our policy guidance in line with the new framework outlined in the revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that the Committee approved last August.4 In our new framework, we acknowledge that policy decisions going forward will be based on the FOMC's estimates of ""shortfalls [emphasis added] of employment from its maximum level""â€”not ""deviations.""",2021-01-08
"This language means that going forward, a low unemployment rate, in and of itself, will not be sufficient to trigger a tightening of monetary policy absent any evidence from other indicators that inflation is at risk of moving above mandate-consistent levels.",2021-01-08
"With regard to our price-stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importanceâ€”and the challengeâ€”of keeping inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent in a world in which an effective-lower-bound constraint is, in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate.",2021-01-08
"To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it ""seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,"" andâ€”in the same sentenceâ€”that therefore ""following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.""",2021-01-08
"As Chair Powell indicated in his Jackson Hole remarks, we think of our new framework as an evolution from ""flexible inflation targeting"" to ""flexible average inflation targeting.",2021-01-08
"""5 While this new framework represents a robust evolution in our monetary policy strategy, this strategy is in service to the dual-mandate goals of monetary policy assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congressâ€”maximum employment and price stabilityâ€”which remain unchanged.6 Concluding Remarks While our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and will continue to do so as the recovery progresses, it will take some time for economic activity and employment to return to levels that prevailed at the business cycle peak reached last February.",2021-01-08
"I can think of no better way to celebrate the signal contributions of this leading force in the world of monetary policymaking than to address an issue of great importance to central banks, and one that has drawn considerable public attention and comment of late--namely, the proper role of asset prices in the determination of monetary policy.",2006-03-16
"At the outset, let me stress that I will be expressing my own opinions, which are not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.1 Two Strategies for Dealing with Market BubblesMost fluctuations in stock prices, real estate values, and other asset prices pose no particular challenge to central banks, as they are just some of the usual factors influencing the outlook for real activity and inflation.",2006-03-16
The first approach--which I will label the conventional strategy--calls for central banks to focus exclusively on the stability of prices and economic activity over the next several years.,2006-03-16
"Under this policy, a central bank responds to stock prices, home values, and other asset prices only insofar as they have implications for future output and inflation over the medium term.",2006-03-16
"Importantly, the strategy eschews any attempt to influence the speculative component of asset prices, treating any perceived mis-pricing as, rightly or wrongly, an essentially exogenous process.",2006-03-16
"If policymakers suspect that a bubble is likely, say, to expand for a time before collapsing, the implications of that possibility for future output and inflation need to be folded into their deliberations.",2006-03-16
"Despite its approach to perceived speculative activity, the conventional strategy does recognize that monetary policy has an important influence on asset prices--indeed, this influence is at the heart of the transmission of policy decisions to real activity and inflation.",2006-03-16
"It occurs through standard arbitrage channels, such as the link between interest rates and the discount factor used to value expected future earnings.",2006-03-16
"It was described at length in ""Asset Price Bubbles and Monetary Policy,"" an article published by the ECB last year.",2006-03-16
It would thus possibly tolerate a certain deviation from its price stability objective in the shorter term in exchange for enhanced prospects of preserving price and economic stability in the future.,2006-03-16
"""2 I am labeling this second approach extra action, as it calls for steps that would not be taken in ordinary circumstances.3 Compared with the first approach, the extra-action strategy responds to a perceived speculative boom with tighter monetary policy--and thus lower output and inflation in the near term--with the expectation of significantly mitigating the potential fallout from a possible future bursting of the bubble.",2006-03-16
"As the ECB article stresses, such an attempt would be extremely dangerous given the risk that a concerted effort at stamping out a speculative boom would lead to outsized interest rate hikes and recession.",2006-03-16
"Both policies aim to achieve the same general objectives of monetary policy, using the same broad analytic framework.",2006-03-16
"Most central banks, I believe, share these basic features of monetary policymaking, notwithstanding important differences in their official mandates and the nature of their economies.",2006-03-16
"At the risk of considerable oversimplification, policymakers can be described as seeking to set policy over time so as to minimize the present value of future deviations of output from potential and inflation from a desired level.",2006-03-16
"This statement is true whether our institutions have a specific mandate to keep inflation low and stable and output close to potential, as in the United States, or whether our mandate is defined primarily in terms of stabilizing inflation, as in the euro area.",2006-03-16
"Stabilizing output complements maintaining price stability in the medium to long run, and often in the short run as well.",2006-03-16
We also can agree that asset prices play critical and complicated roles in determining real activity and inflation--roles that may be changing over time because an increasing share of wealth is market-determined and easily liquified.,2006-03-16
Movements in stock prices and real estate values affect household wealth and thus consumer spending.,2006-03-16
"Changes in bond prices, stock prices, and exchange rates imply movements in the cost of capital and relative prices that influence investment and foreign trade; exchange rate movements also directly affect the prices of goods and services.",2006-03-16
"Finally, asset prices can affect the value of collateral and thus the provision of credit, thereby influencing aggregate spending.",2006-03-16
"In sum, asset prices influence the economy in complex and subtle ways over potentially extended periods of time.",2006-03-16
"Finally, I think it fair to say that most central banks, faced with only a limited understanding of asset prices and their interactions with the full economy, engage in a form of risk management when dealing with market booms and busts.",2006-03-16
"In part, they do this because any particular policy under consideration is never associated with a single forecast for the future paths of output and inflation but, instead, with a large set of possible scenarios with differing odds of coming to pass.",2006-03-16
The boom was fueled by a sustained acceleration of productivity and an accompanying rise in corporate profits--fundamental changes that justified a major rise in equity prices.,2006-03-16
"How high those prices should have risen was difficult to judge in real time because no one, not investors or central bankers, could be sure how fast profits would grow in the future.",2006-03-16
"In the event, share prices increased more than was justified by improved fundamentals.",2006-03-16
"But overly optimistic expectations for long-run earnings growth were not being driven by easy money, and I see no reason to believe that an extra 50 or even 100 basis points on the funds rate would have had much of a damping effect on investor beliefs in the potential profitability of emerging technologies.",2006-03-16
"At present, we just do not have any empirical evidence of a link between interest rates and corporate equity valuation errors, as opposed to standard arbitrage effects.",2006-03-16
"In general, we have a very poor understanding of the forces driving speculative bubbles and the role played by monetary policy.",2006-03-16
"When the FOMC tightened in 1999 and early 2000, the trajectory of stock prices actually steepened, and equity premiums fell--perhaps because investors became more confident that good macroeconomic performance would be sustained.",2006-03-16
"These episodes illustrate that risk premiums often move in mysterious ways, and we should not count on the ability of monetary policy to nudge them in the intended direction.",2006-03-16
"For example, homeowners, who may have a less sophisticated understanding of the economy than professional investors, might mistakenly view a one-time rise in home prices--resulting, say, from a decline in interest rates--as evidence of a more persistent upward trend.",2006-03-16
"If so, a monetary easing directed at stabilizing output and inflation might, conceivably, drive up real estate values by more than fundamentals alone would merit.",2006-03-16
"Still, you would expect any mis-pricing from these sources to be reversed over time as interest rates returned to normal.",2006-03-16
"More broadly, further research into the causal connections, if any, between monetary policy and bubbles would seem to be needed before we would know enough to be able to act on such linkages with much confidence.5 However, let us suppose a situation arises in which we are convinced that tighter policy would check the future expansion of an emerging speculative bubble.",2006-03-16
"To explain this statement, I note again that extra action with near-certainty weakens the economy and reduces inflation before the bubble bursts in exchange for the chance of better macroeconomic performance in the future.",2006-03-16
But it does not follow that conventional monetary policy cannot adequately deal with the threat of deflation by expeditiously mopping up after the bubble collapses.,2006-03-16
"Rather than demonstrating the need for preemptive extra action to restrain emerging bubbles, these examples are object lessons concerning the wisdom of central banks' easing promptly and aggressively following market slumps when inflation is already low, so as to head off the threat posed by the zero lower bound.",2006-03-16
"To see this, suppose that a speculative bubble has emerged and that a central bank, operating under a conventional strategy, has raised interest rates to keep the projected output gap closed and expected inflation at its desired level before the bubble bursts.",2006-03-16
"In a low-inflation environment, such a step would be a bad idea if, after averaging across all the possible outcomes weighted by their likelihoods, the predicted moderation in the bubble from tighter policy is small.",2006-03-16
"In this case, the expected weakening in real activity after the bubble bursts would be only marginally less severe under extra action, but inflation would be substantially lower because the extra action policy would have generated persistent economic slack beforehand.",2006-03-16
"With inflation having already started out at a low level, such a decline would be extremely dangerous because the zero bound would now be much more likely to constrain monetary policy after the bubble bursts.",2006-03-16
"But it is hard to see much of a cost in terms of diminished aggregate productivity, given the robust growth of output per hour over the past few years.",2006-03-16
"Furthermore, even if tighter monetary policy would have damped the enthusiasm for dot-com firms in the late 1990s, higher interest rates would have also led to less housing and less business investment outside the high-tech sector, where valuations were not obviously out of line with fundamentals.",2006-03-16
"And, as I have been pointing out, extra action would have idled some capital entirely for a time as economic activity fell short of its level consistent with stable inflation.",2006-03-16
"The ECB article stressed that such identification is a tricky proposition because not all the fundamental factors driving asset prices are directly observable, as the productivity acceleration and stock market boom of the 1990s illustrate.",2006-03-16
"For this reason, any judgment by a central bank that stocks or homes are overpriced is inherently highly uncertain.",2006-03-16
"By acting to mitigate a nonexistent problem, the central bank reduces real economic activity and inflation below their desired levels to no purpose.",2006-03-16
"Admittedly, policymakers, once they recognize their mistake, would presumably want the economy to run hotter for a time to restore the previous rate of inflation and would thereby make up for the initial output losses.",2006-03-16
But coming to the realization that the original assessment was mistaken and that asset prices were in line with fundamentals is likely to take some time.,2006-03-16
"Unfortunately, I suspect that this call would often come so late in the day that, given the lags in the monetary transmission mechanism and uncertainty about the duration of bubbles, raising interest rates might actually risk exacerbating instability.",2006-03-16
"Notwithstanding the controversial aspects of identifying bubbles, policymakers may still want to warn the public about the possibility of asset price misalignments when the evidence merits.",2006-03-16
"In particular, the claim is often made that, based on the FOMC's actions over the past twenty years, the Fed actively works to support the economy in an event of a sharp decline in asset markets but does little or nothing to restrain markets when prices are rising, thereby creating moral hazard problems.",2006-03-16
"U.S. monetary policy has responded symmetrically to the implications of asset-price movements for actual and projected developments in output and inflation, consistent with its mandate.",2006-03-16
"The most convincing evidence for this statement can be found in the results: Interest rates have been consistent with underlying inflation remaining reasonably stable for some time now, accompanied by relatively mild fluctuations in real activity.7 Conventional policy as practiced by the Federal Reserve has not insulated investors from downside risk.",2006-03-16
"Whatever might have once been thought about the existence of a ""Greenspan put,"" stock market investors could not have endured the experience of the last five years in the United States and concluded that they were hedged on the downside by asymmetric monetary policy.",2006-03-16
"Nor, for that matter, should they have concluded that the Federal Reserve does not act on the upside: If asset prices had been more closely aligned with fundamentals in the late 1990s, our policy would almost certainly have been easier, all else equal, because aggregate demand would have been weaker and hence inflation pressures even more muted than they were.",2006-03-16
"The same considerations apply to homeowners: All else being equal, interest rates are higher now than they would be were real estate valuations less lofty; and if real estate prices begin to erode, homeowners should not expect to see all the gains of recent years preserved by monetary policy actions.",2006-03-16
"Our actions will continue to be keyed to macroeconomic stability, not the stability of asset prices themselves.",2006-03-16
"It is one thing for policymakers to raise questions about the relationship of asset prices to fundamentals and another for a central bank to take action to influence valuations in the direction of some ""appropriate"" level.",2006-03-16
"And what is the risk that, in taking such steps, a central bank would be seen by investors as taking on partial responsibility for asset prices?",2006-03-16
"If so, would the pressure on central banks to support asset prices in market downturns increase?",2006-03-16
"I will offer my preliminary views on the Federal Reserve's review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications after first touching briefly on the economic outlook.",2019-11-26
"The framework review is ongoing and will extend into 2020, and no conclusions have been reached at this time.1 Outlook and Policy There are good reasons to expect the economy to grow at a pace modestly above potential over the next year or so, supported by strong consumers and a healthy job market, despite persistent uncertainty about trade conflict and disappointing foreign growth.",2019-11-26
"Consumer sentiment remains solid, and the employment picture is positive.",2019-11-26
Housing seems to have turned a corner and is poised for growth following several weak quarters.,2019-11-26

Employment remains strong.,2019-11-26
"The employment-to-population ratio for prime-age adults has moved up to its pre-recession peak, and the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate is near a 50-year low.2 Monthly job gains remain above the pace needed to absorb new entrants into the labor force despite some slowing since last year.",2019-11-26

"Inflation remains below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent symmetric objective, which has been true for most of the past seven years.",2019-11-26
"The price index for core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which excludes food and energy prices and is a better indicator of future inflation than overall PCE prices, increased 1.7 percent over the 12 months through September.",2019-11-26
Foreign growth remains subdued.,2019-11-26
"While there are signs that the decline in euro-area manufacturing is stabilizing, the latest indicators on economic activity in China remain sluggish, and the news in Japan and in many emerging markets has been disappointing.",2019-11-26
"Overall, it appears third-quarter foreign growth was weak, and the latest indicators point to little improvement in the fourth quarter.",2019-11-26
"The baseline is for continued moderate expansion, a strong labor market, and inflation moving gradually to our symmetric 2 percent objective.",2019-11-26
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has taken significant action to provide insurance against the risks associated with trade conflict and weak foreign growth against a backdrop of muted inflation.,2019-11-26
"It will take some time for the full effect of this accommodation to work its way through economic activity, the labor market, and inflation.",2019-11-26
"Review The Federal Reserve is conducting a review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications to make sure we are well positioned to advance our statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability.3 Three key features of today's new normal call for a reassessment of our monetary policy strategy: the neutral rate is very low here and abroad, trend inflation is running below target, and the sensitivity of price inflation to resource utilization is very low.4 First, trend inflation is below target.5 Underlying trend inflation appears to be running a few tenths below the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective, according to various statistical filters.",2019-11-26
This raises the risk that households and businesses could come to expect inflation to run persistently below our target and change their behavior in a way that reinforces that expectation.,2019-11-26
"Indeed, with inflation having fallen short of 2 percent for most of the past seven years, inflation expectations may have declined, as suggested by some survey-based measures of long-run inflation expectations and by market-based measures of inflation compensation.",2019-11-26
"Second, the sensitivity of price inflation to resource utilization is very low.",2019-11-26
"A flat Phillips curve has the important advantage of allowing employment to continue expanding for longer without generating inflationary pressures, thereby providing greater opportunities to more people.",2019-11-26
But it also makes it harder to achieve our 2 percent inflation objective on a sustained basis when inflation expectations have drifted below 2 percent.,2019-11-26
"Third, the long-run neutral rate of interest is very low, which means that we are likely to see more frequent and prolonged episodes when the federal funds rate is stuck at its effective lower bound (ELB).6 The neutral rate is the level of the federal funds rate that would keep the economy at full employment and 2 percent inflation if no tailwinds or headwinds were buffeting the economy.",2019-11-26
"A variety of forces have likely contributed to a decline in the neutral rate, including demographic trends in many large economies, some slowing in the rate of productivity growth, and increases in the demand for safe assets.",2019-11-26
"This large loss of policy space will tend to increase the frequency or length of periods when the policy rate is pinned at the ELB, unemployment is elevated, and inflation is below target.9 In turn, the experience of frequent or extended periods of low inflation at the ELB risks eroding inflation expectations and further compressing the conventional policy space.",2019-11-26
"The risk is a downward spiral where conventional policy space gets compressed even further, the ELB binds even more frequently, and it becomes increasingly difficult to move inflation expectations and inflation back up to target.",2019-11-26
"While consumers and businesses might see very low inflation as having benefits at the individual level, at the aggregate level, inflation that is too low can make it very challenging for monetary policy to cut the short-term nominal interest rate sufficiently to cushion the economy effectively.10 The experience of Japan and of the euro area more recently suggests that this risk is real.",2019-11-26
"Indeed, the fact that Japan and the euro area are struggling with this challenging triad further complicates our task, because there are important potential spillovers from monetary policy in other major economies to our own economy through exchange rate and yield curve channels.11 In light of the likelihood of more frequent episodes at the ELB, our monetary policy review should advance two goals.",2019-11-26
"First, monetary policy should achieve average inflation outcomes of 2 percent over time to re-anchor inflation expectations at our target.",2019-11-26
Achieving the Inflation Target The apparent slippage in trend inflation below our target calls for some adjustments to our monetary policy strategy and communications.,2019-11-26
"In this context and as part of our review, my colleagues and I have been discussing how to better anchor inflation expectations firmly at our objective.",2019-11-26
"In particular, it may be helpful to specify that policy aims to achieve inflation outcomes that average 2 percent over time or over the cycle.",2019-11-26
"Given the persistent shortfall of inflation from its target over recent years, this would imply supporting inflation a bit above 2 percent for some time to compensate for the period of underperformance.",2019-11-26
"One class of strategies that has been proposed to address this issue are formal ""makeup"" rules that seek to compensate for past inflation deviations from target.",2019-11-26
"For instance, under price-level targeting, policy seeks to stabilize the price level around a constant growth path that is consistent with the inflation objective.12 Under average inflation targeting, policy seeks to return the average of inflation to the target over some specified period.13 To be successful, formal makeup strategies require that financial market participants, households, and businesses understand in advance and believe, to some degree, that policy will compensate for past misses.",2019-11-26
"For example, if inflation has been running well belowâ€”or aboveâ€”target for a sustained period, when the time arrives to maintain inflation commensurately aboveâ€”or belowâ€”2 percent for the same amount of time, economic conditions will typically be inconsistent with implementing the promised action.",2019-11-26
"Analysis also suggests it could take many years with a formal average inflation targeting framework to return inflation to target following an ELB episode, although this depends on difficult-to-assess modeling assumptions and the particulars of the strategy.14 Thus, while formal average inflation targeting rules have some attractive properties in theory, they could be challenging to implement in practice.",2019-11-26
I prefer a more flexible approach that would anchor inflation expectations at 2 percent by achieving inflation outcomes that average 2 percent over time or over the cycle.,2019-11-26
"For instance, following five years when the public has observed inflation outcomes in the range of 1-1/2 to 2 percent, to avoid a decline in expectations, the Committee would target inflation outcomes in a range of, say, 2 to 2-1/2 percent for the subsequent five years to achieve inflation outcomes of 2 percent on average overall.",2019-11-26
"Flexible inflation averaging could bring some of the benefits of a formal average inflation targeting rule, but it would be simpler to communicate.",2019-11-26
"By committing to achieve inflation outcomes that average 2 percent over time, the Committee would make clear in advance that it would accommodate rather than offset modest upward pressures to inflation in what could be described as a process of opportunistic reflation.15 Policy at the ELB Second, the Committee is examining what monetary policy tools are likely to be effective in providing accommodation when the federal funds rate is at the ELB.16 In my view, the review should make clear that the Committee will actively employ its full toolkit so that the ELB is not an impediment to providing accommodation in the face of significant economic disruptions.",2019-11-26
"For these reasons, I have been interested in exploring approaches that expand the space for targeting interest rates in a more continuous fashion as an extension of our conventional policy space and in a way that reinforces forward guidance on the policy rate.18 In particular, there may be advantages to an approach that caps interest rates on Treasury securities at the short-to-medium range of the maturity spectrumâ€”yield curve capsâ€”in tandem with forward guidance that conditions liftoff from the ELB on employment and inflation outcomes.",2019-11-26
"To be specific, once the policy rate declines to the ELB, this approach would smoothly move to capping interest rates on the short-to-medium segment of the yield curve.",2019-11-26
"Moreover, if the horizon on the interest rate caps is set so as to reinforce forward guidance on the policy rate, doing so would augment the credibility of the yield curve caps and thereby diminish concerns about an open-ended balance sheet commitment.",2019-11-26
"As we saw in the United States at the end of 2015 and again toward the second half of 2016, there tends to be strong pressure to ""normalize"" or lift off from the ELB preemptively based on historical relationships between inflation and employment.",2019-11-26
"Indeed, recent research suggests that forward guidance that commits to delay the liftoff from the ELB until full employment and 2 percent inflation have been achieved on a sustained basisâ€”say over the course of a yearâ€”could improve performance on our dual-mandate goals.19 To reinforce this commitment, the forward guidance on the policy rate could be implemented in tandem with yield curve caps.",2019-11-26
"For example, as the federal funds rate approaches the ELB, the Committee could commit to refrain from lifting off the ELB until full employment and 2 percent inflation are sustained for a year.",2019-11-26
"If the outlook shifts materially, the Committee could reassess how long it will take to get inflation back to 2 percent and adjust policy accordingly.",2019-11-26
The combination of a commitment to condition liftoff on the sustained achievement of our employment and inflation objectives with yield curve caps targeted at the same horizon has the potential to work well in many circumstances.,2019-11-26
"Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Before closing, it is important to recall another important lesson of the financial crisis: The stability of the financial system is important to the achievement of the statutory goals of full employment and 2 percent inflation.",2019-11-26
"In that regard, the changes in the macroeconomic environment that underlie our monetary policy review may have some implications for financial stability.",2019-11-26
"Historically, when the Phillips curve was steeper, inflation tended to rise as the economy heated up, which prompted the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.",2019-11-26
"In turn, the interest rate increases would have the effect of tightening financial conditions more broadly.",2019-11-26
"With a flat Phillips curve, inflation does not rise as much as resource utilization tightens, and interest rates are less likely to rise to restrictive levels.",2019-11-26
"The resulting lower-for-longer interest rates, along with sustained high rates of resource utilization, are conducive to increasing risk appetite, which could prompt reach-for-yield behavior and incentives to take on additional debt, leading to financial imbalances as an expansion extends.",2019-11-26
"To the extent that the combination of a low neutral rate, a flat Phillips curve, and low underlying inflation may lead financial stability risks to become more tightly linked to the business cycle, it would be preferable to use tools other than tightening monetary policy to temper the financial cycle.",2019-11-26
"In particular, active use of macroprudential tools such as the countercyclical buffer is vital to enable monetary policy to stay focused on achieving maximum employment and average inflation of 2 percent on a sustained basis.",2019-11-26
"Conclusion The Federal Reserve's commitment to adapt our monetary policy strategy to changing circumstances has enabled us to support the U.S. economy throughout the expansion, which is now in its 11th year.",2019-11-26
"In light of the decline in the neutral rate, low trend inflation, and low sensitivity of inflation to slack as well as the consequent greater frequency of the policy rate being at the effective lower bound, this is an important time to review our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications in order to improve the achievement of our statutory goals.",2019-11-26
"I have offered some preliminary thoughts on how we could bolster inflation expectations by achieving inflation outcomes of 2 percent on average over time and, when policy is constrained by the ELB, how we could combine forward guidance on the policy rate with caps on the short-to-medium segment of the yield curve to buffer the economy against adverse developments.",2019-11-26
The question of whether a country should adopt inflation targeting raises several issues.,2005-05-26
"At the theoretical level, inflation targeting is alleged to promote central bank transparency, clarify communication, and establish a central bank commitment to price stability.",2005-05-26
These advantages are offset by the fact that inflation targeting could lead to rigid or formulaic policies that limit flexibility.,2005-05-26
Given the impossibility of rewriting history--trying to determine either what an inflation-targeting central bank would have done in response to some economic shock had it been a nontargeter or what a nontargeting central bank would have done had it been a targeter--the theoretical debate has never proved conclusive in deciding for or against inflation targeting.,2005-05-26
"Econometric studies find that, in countries that have adopted inflation targeting, inflation rates have fallen, spreads between nominal and real interest rates have fallen, other measures of expectations of inflation have fallen, and macroeconomic growth numbers have not worsened and have often improved.",2005-05-26
"From this point of view, inflation targeting looks to have been successful.",2005-05-26
"But inflation rates have also fallen, nominal-real spreads have fallen, inflation expectations have fallen, and macroeconomic growth numbers have improved in at least one significant country that has not adopted inflation targeting, the United States.",2005-05-26
"The general verdict of the many comparison studies seems to be in favor of inflation targeting, but something else, most likely the sheer commitment to price stability, has also appeared to have worked just as well in the United States.",2005-05-26
"For countries that have not yet adopted inflation targeting, a key issue then becomes politics.",2005-05-26
"The countries that have adopted inflation targeting report that the regime has helped to clarify the relationship between the central bank and the government, generally giving the government say over the ultimate objectives of monetary policy but the central bank freedom in how it pursues these objectives.",2005-05-26
But these are usually parliamentary countries where the governmental authorities have strongly endorsed inflation targeting.,2005-05-26
"There is a large question about what a central bank should do in a congressional system, when its government has not endorsed inflation targeting.",2005-05-26
"After reviewing present-day inflation-targeting relationships around the world, I turn my attention to political considerations for the United States.",2005-05-26
"Present Inflation-Targeting Arrangements The first country to adopt inflation targeting, New Zealand, did so with strong support and fairly specific instructions from its legislature.",2005-05-26
"This act gave the central bank the objective ""of achieving and maintaining stability in the general level of prices,"" with ""regard for the efficiency and soundness of the financial system.""",2005-05-26
The act provided that the government and Reserve Bank jointly determine the specific inflation target and other policy objectives through Policy Target Agreements.,2005-05-26
"The first of these target agreements defined price stability as a range of 0 percent to 2 percent in New Zealand's Consumers Price Index (CPI), set a goal of achieving price stability two years hence, and gave conditions that could justify going outside the price stability band.",2005-05-26
"Subsequent agreements have modified the target CPI, widened the tolerance band, and introduced other objectives, such as the stability of output growth.",2005-05-26
These modifications have generally made New Zealand's inflation-targeting regime much more flexible.,2005-05-26
"Governmental involvement was still very important, though somewhat less explicit, for the next three inflation targeters.",2005-05-26
Chile's adoption of inflation targeting in 1990 was preceded by new central bank legislation.,2005-05-26
"Canada, which adopted inflation targeting in 1991, used the vehicle of a joint announcement by the Ministry of Finance and the governor of the Bank of Canada.",2005-05-26
"This announcement, and subsequent joint announcements, established a target range for price stability but left the details, and the responsibility for policy, in the hands of the Bank.",2005-05-26
"In Britain, which adopted inflation targeting in 1992, the chancellor of the Exchequer first announced the inflation goal.",2005-05-26
"In the next wave of inflation targeters, there was less-explicit governmental involvement.",2005-05-26
"In Sweden, which adopted inflation targeting in 1993, the government had previously announced that controlling inflation was an overriding goal for the Riksbank.",2005-05-26
"In Australia, the Reserve Bank governor announced its inflation-targeting regime in a speech, using broad, previously delegated authority.",2005-05-26
"In Norway, the Norges Bank operates under a governmental mandate declaring that the long-term objective of monetary policy is to maintain the domestic and international value of its currency.",2005-05-26
"The European Central Bank (ECB) operates its regime under authority delegated by the Treaty Establishing the European Community, with the primary goal of price stability established by the treaty.",2005-05-26
Lessons are more diffuse from the last wave of countries to adopt inflation targeting.,2005-05-26
Brazil's adoption of inflation targeting in 1999 was preceded by a presidential decree.,2005-05-26
Hungary and Poland adopted inflation targeting following parliamentary acts stipulating that price stability was the main objective for the central bank.,2005-05-26
"But in two cases, Mexico and the Czech Republic, the central bank moved to inflation targeting on its own.",2005-05-26
"In the Czech Republic, subsequent legislation enshrined price stability as the main objective of the central bank, but not in Mexico.",2005-05-26
"The level of involvement ranges from New Zealand's explicit governmental guidance to other, much more flexible arrangements that give the central bank fairly wide latitude in establishing target ranges, choosing indexes, and choosing time periods over which to meet the price stability objectives.",2005-05-26
There may also be a correlation between governmental involvement and the strictness of the inflation-targeting regime.,2005-05-26
The United States The main country that has not adopted inflation targeting is the United States.,2005-05-26
"Although academic economists and many others have for years been urging the Federal Reserve to adopt inflation targeting, legislators have shown very little interest in the issue.",2005-05-26
"Congressman Jim Saxton of New Jersey, chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, has introduced an inflation-targeting bill several times, but the bill currently has no cosponsors and has not been reviewed recently in committee hearings.",2005-05-26
Previous inflation-targeting bills have fared no better.,2005-05-26
"This lack of congressional momentum could be interpreted as lack of congressional support for inflation targeting, or it could merely reflect a more neutral absence of strong opinions.",2005-05-26
"Given the absence of firmer congressional guidance, the Federal Reserve has continued to operate under the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978.",2005-05-26
"This act directs the Fed to ""promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.""",2005-05-26
"Academics and others urge the Federal Reserve to adopt inflation targeting, but should the Fed do so on its own?",2005-05-26
"If the Fed does something on its own, how strict an inflation-targeting regime should it be?",2005-05-26
The politics of inflation targeting have never been fully explored.,2005-05-26
We should first recognize that the form of the U.S. government is different than that of most inflation-targeting countries.,2005-05-26
"This problem is not necessarily insuperable; all political actors might recognize the value of price stability and might appreciate inflation targeting, at least in its softer form.",2005-05-26
A first place is the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act itself.,2005-05-26
"As amended, this act requires the Fed to make a semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress, accompanied by testimony from the Chairman of the Federal Reserve.",2005-05-26
"These reports and testimony have been occasions for the Fed to report on concepts and developments, though never one as significant as inflation targeting.",2005-05-26
"It is hard to imagine the Fed's using these hearings to announce a full-blown inflation-targeting regime, though it is conceivable that the Fed could use them to propose soft target bands for price stability, or at least to get more specific about the Fed's commitment to price stability.",2005-05-26
"But in the end, using the Monetary Policy Reports from the Fed as a means of getting the Congress to endorse inflation targeting would be stretching things.",2005-05-26
One could imagine a similar process for inflation targeting.,2005-05-26
"For the Fed to write rules for a strict inflation-targeting regime on its own would presumably be impossible, though one might interpret ""maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates"" as an invitation for the Fed to write rules to institute a soft form of inflation targeting.",2005-05-26
"When it has had opportunities, the Congress has never moved ahead on inflation targeting, possibly because of outright opposition, possibly because of a desire for neutral non-involvement.",2005-05-26
A Fed announcement about inflation targeting would be much more significant than the other more-technical and more-data-oriented announcements or pronouncements the Fed normally gives in its Monetary Policy Reports.,2005-05-26
"And for the Fed to interpret the broad language of the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act as an invitation to write rules instituting a strict form of inflation targeting would be an extreme stretch, though perhaps not for a soft form of inflation targeting.",2005-05-26
"Normative Considerations Granted that there is not much legal precedent for going ahead with inflation targeting on its own, would there be any value in having the Fed start a conversation with the Congress?",2005-05-26
But what if the Fed were actually to propose a soft form of inflation targeting?,2005-05-26
Such a proposal might change the dynamics and raise the possibility that the Congress could at least tacitly endorse inflation targeting.,2005-05-26
The advantages of soliciting congressional support for inflation targeting would be essentially those normally ascribed to inflation targeting in the first place.,2005-05-26
"The Fed's announcements could become clearer and more transparent, its commitment to price stability could become more universally understood, and market participants could have a better idea of what specifically the Fed means by price stability.",2005-05-26
"The present ""bias"" statement in the Fed's announcement of changes in the federal funds rate target could be supplanted with a statement on whether inflation is tending to the upper or lower bound of the Fed's price stability range.",2005-05-26
"I see no particular need to clarify the relationship between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve in the United States--already there is agreement that the Treasury should be the only agency that comments on currency values, and that the Fed should be the only agency that comments on monetary policy--but added demarcations can never hurt.",2005-05-26
Another advantage would be that inflation targeting could assist in clarifying roles.,2005-05-26
"When the Chairman testifies on the Monetary Policy Report, most of the questions involve an incredibly broad range of topics--fiscal policy, tax policy, entitlement spending issues, trade issues, and wage distribution questions.",2005-05-26
"I can see a democratic effectiveness argument for rerouting these questions back to the area of direct Federal Reserve responsibility, and discussion of how to implement inflation targeting might well do that.",2005-05-26
These discussions might also make it clear that price stability--not all these other matters--is the primary economic outcome for which the Fed is responsible.,2005-05-26
A modern-day macroeconomist would have no trouble in understanding why the Fed would put a target band on inflation but not on unemployment and not on long-term interest rates.,2005-05-26
"In modern-day macroeconomics, inflation is a policy choice variable--there is essentially no long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, and it is up to monetary policy to choose the long-run rate of inflation.",2005-05-26
"Zero inflation, or close to zero depending on measurement error and other technical details, is as good as any other choice in promoting ultimate macroeconomic goals such as full employment and long-term economic growth.",2005-05-26
Keeping inflation close to zero has the further advantage of limiting the microeconomic costs and tax distortions caused by inflation.,2005-05-26
Hence a target zone for price stability fits perfectly into the standard macro model.,2005-05-26
"Were the Fed, or the Congress, to set a target bound on the unemployment rate, that bound might not be consistent with the so-called natural, or non-inflationary, rate of unemployment.",2005-05-26
"Were the target band, say, below the natural rate, the Fed would be forced to follow policies likely to lead to accelerating inflation.",2005-05-26
"Similarly, a target band for long-term interest rates below the equilibrium long-term rate could also again force the Fed to pump money out to a highly inflationary degree.",2005-05-26
"As evidence, one could use the 1960s and 1970s as dramatic indications of what happens when macro policy violates the natural unemployment rate rule and the equilibrium interest rate rule, with rather dire subsequent inflationary consequences.",2005-05-26
"Or the 1990s could be used as an illustration of how monetary policy could lower inflation, with concomitant gains in terms of full employment and long-term economic growth.",2005-05-26
Similar conversations might have occurred in all those countries where the government seems to have eagerly adopted inflation targeting.,2005-05-26
"But these attempts to explain inflation targeting still might not work, and the Congress might still delineate specific unemployment and interest rate goals along with inflation goals.",2005-05-26
"Were such to be the case, particularly if the specific goals for unemployment or interest rates were set inappropriately, as was done in the Humphrey-Hawkins Act of the late 1970s, I believe that even die-hard advocates of inflation targeting would consider the costs greater than the benefits.",2005-05-26
"Given the already good inflation performance in the United States, the benefits of adopting inflation targeting are likely to be modest.",2005-05-26
Another potential political cost of inflation targeting involves loss of flexibility.,2005-05-26
"As inflation targeting has evolved in other countries, and in the thinking of academic economists, a flexible approach to inflation targeting has proved quite popular.",2005-05-26
"Specific goals for inflation are important, yes, but not under any and all circumstances.",2005-05-26
"Sometimes monetary authorities, even under inflation targeting, must respond to these shocks by going outside the price stability band for a short period.",2005-05-26
"For example, the ECB has held its short-term interest rate at a low level for a significant period even though inflation has been slightly above its target ceiling most of that time.",2005-05-26
"Many outside observers believe that economic sluggishness is the real problem in Europe and are quite sympathetic with the ECB strategy, even though it may violate a strict interpretation of inflation targeting.",2005-05-26
Most experts and others interested in inflation targeting understand this need for flexibility and are quite comfortable with flexible inflation-targeting schemes.,2005-05-26
"Were the inflation rate temporarily outside the target band, even for good economic reasons, the mere existence of inflation targets could be another excuse for tension between the Fed and the Congress.",2005-05-26
"None of these supposed political costs of inflation targeting are certain, all could be readily handled, and it is at least possible that only vague congressional support for inflation targeting would ultimately be necessary.",2005-05-26
But we should recognize that same clarity of inflation targeting that has generally proved advantageous in other countries contains at least the seeds for potential disagreements in the United States.,2005-05-26
"Conclusion All debates about whether the United States should adopt inflation targeting are fairly amorphous, balancing speculative theoretical considerations and imaging hypothetical situations.",2005-05-26
"Given the good inflationary performance of the American economy in the past decade, the question of whether to adopt inflation targeting has never been an all-out do-or-die issue.",2005-05-26
"But surely it is relevant that, in other countries that have adopted inflation targeting, the parliamentary governments have generally been strong supporters, whereas in the United States Administration and congressional support has ranged from weak to non-existent.",2005-05-26
"The number one challenge, of course, is inflation, which continues to be much too high, and a heavy burden for households and businesses.",2022-08-06
I will share my reasoning for supporting this increase and why I support continued increases until inflation is on a consistent path to significantly decline.,2022-08-06
"Inflation continued to climb in June, reaching 9.1 percent as measured by the consumer price index.",2022-08-06
"This is yet another concerningly high reading, and it set another 40-year record high despite the expectation of many forecasters that inflation had peaked earlier in the year.",2022-08-06
"I have seen few, if any, concrete indications that support this expectation, and I will need to see unambiguous evidence of this decline before I incorporate an easing of inflation pressures into my outlook.",2022-08-06
"Many of the underlying causes of excessive inflation are the same as they have been over the past year or soâ€”supply chain issues, including those related to China's COVID containment policies, constrained housing supply, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, fiscal stimulus, and limitations on domestic energy production.",2022-08-06
"Regardless of the source of the inflationary pressure, the Federal Reserve has a duty to bring inflation down to our 2 percent target.",2022-08-06
This duty is mandated by Congress to carry out monetary policy that results in price stabilityâ€”meaning low and stable inflation.,2022-08-06
"We all understand why this is a critically important responsibility, especially in times of extreme inflation.",2022-08-06
"Rising prices for food, housing, and energy negatively impact affordability for all Americans, but especially those with low or moderate incomes.",2022-08-06
"For those workers who drive long distances to get to work, high inflation is especially concerning, requiring some to make tradeoffs between feeding their families and buying fuel to fill gas tanks.",2022-08-06
"Some workers have seen their wages grow significantly over the past two years, but most have seen any gains in wages far outpaced by higher prices.",2022-08-06
"Therefore, in my mind, it is absolutely critical that we continue to use our monetary policy tools until we are successful in returning inflation to our 2 percent goal.",2022-08-06
Businesses are also suffering from elevated inflation through rising and volatile prices for inputs and the need to price their own goods and services to cover costs without losing customers.,2022-08-06
Prices for commodities have declined lately but are still at historically high levels.,2022-08-06
"In contrast, prices for fertilizer and many crop inputs continue to rise.",2022-08-06
"I see a significant risk of high inflation into next year for necessities including food, housing, fuel, and vehicles.",2022-08-06
"Rents have grown dramatically, and while home sales have slowed, the continued increasing price of single-family homes indicates to me that rents won't decline anytime in the near future.",2022-08-06
"Recently, gasoline prices have moderated but are still roughly 80 percent higher than pre-pandemic levels due to constrained domestic supply and the disruption of world markets.",2022-08-06
"And I see continued inflation risk from motor vehicle prices, as auto manufacturers struggle with supply chain problems that haven't improved significantly.",2022-08-06
"Demand for cars continues to exceed supply, and retail used car prices are still very high, about 50 percent more than before the pandemic.",2022-08-06
The supply problems pushing up inflation seem likely to persist.,2022-08-06
"An announced reduction in Russian natural gas supplies to Western Europe has driven European prices even higher, causing ripple effects on world energy markets and raising concerns about shortages this winter.",2022-08-06
"China has eased some of its most stringent COVID containment measures but recently revived travel restrictions in some areas, and its approach to the pandemic remains an upside risk for inflation.",2022-08-06
"On the other side of our dual mandate, maximum employment, we continue to see a tight labor market, though there are some emerging signs that would support expectations of loosening.",2022-08-06
Yesterday's job report showed continued significant growth in hiring with the unemployment rate finally returning to the pre-pandemic level of 3.5 percent.,2022-08-06
"As I am sure you all know, the job market in Kansas is even stronger, with an unemployment rate of 2.4 percent in June.",2022-08-06
One aspect of the job market that has not recovered is labor force participation.,2022-08-06
"In contrast to this labor market strength in Kansas and nationwide, output growth has slowed this year.",2022-08-06
My base case is for a pickup in growth during the second half of this year and for moderate growth in 2023.,2022-08-06
"From my perspective, had we known at the time about the eventual large upward revisions in last year's employment data, we likely would have significantly accelerated our monetary policy actions.",2022-08-06
"Taking all of that on board, while the data on economic activity are indeed lower and the view is murky, the evidence on inflation is absolutely clear, which brings me to the implications for monetary policy.",2022-08-06
"My view is that similarly-sized increases should be on the table until we see inflation declining in a consistent, meaningful, and lasting way.",2022-08-06
"In my view, that, combined with data revisions that were directly relevant to our decision making, led to a delay in taking action to address rising inflation.",2022-08-06
It is helpful that the FOMC provided clear direction earlier this year that it was prepared to act quickly to tighten monetary policy.,2022-08-06
"Looking ahead, the FOMC will be getting two months of data on inflation and another month on employment before our next meeting in September, and while I expect that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate, given the uncertainty in how those data and conditions will evolve, I will allow that information to guide my judgment on how big the increases will need to be.",2022-08-06
"I do expect that the labor market will remain strong as we continue to increase interest rates and allow the balance sheet to run off, but there is a risk that our actions will slow job gains, or even reduce employment.",2022-08-06
"Growth has softened, and perhaps this is an indication that our actions to tighten monetary policy are having the desired effect, with the ultimate goal of bringing demand and supply into greater balance.",2022-08-06
"When considering the risks to the labor market, these risks must be viewed in the context of its current strength and with the understanding that our primary challenge is to get inflation under control.",2022-08-06
"In fact, the larger threat to the strong labor market is excessive inflation, which if allowed to continue could lead to a further economic softening, risking a prolonged period of economic weakness coupled with high inflation, like we experienced in the 1970s.",2022-08-06
"In any case, we must fulfill our commitment to lowering inflation, and I will remain steadfastly focused on this task.",2022-08-06
"The oil price spikes of that time clearly had significant macroeconomic implications, representing one of the rare times that higher prices in an individual industry have importantly affected the overall macroeconomy.",2004-09-16
"To account for these effects, structural-model builders had to disaggregate their systems into oil and non-oil, or energy and non-energy, sectors, dealing with effects on both the demand and the supply sides of the economy.",2004-09-16
"In a world where all shocks are on the demand side, policymaking boils down to finding the optimal balance between inflation and unemployment, or in modern parlance, finding the strategy that hits the optimal point on the frontier relating the variances of inflation and unemployment around their target values.",2004-09-16
"Policy must then balance competing objectives in the presence of a shock that normally implies more inflation, more unemployment, or a combination thereof.",2004-09-16
I will first review the evidence on the seriousness of oil shocks for the macroeconomy and then discuss how I think monetary policy should generally respond.,2004-09-16
Oil shocks have serious effects on the economy because they immediately raise prices for an important production input--oil--and important consumer goods--gasoline and heating oil.,2004-09-16
They are also likely to push up prices in other energy markets.,2004-09-16
These price increases are significant enough that they typically show up as temporary bursts in the overall rate of inflation.,2004-09-16
They may even get passed through to continuing rates of inflation if they become incorporated into price- and wage-setting behavior.,2004-09-16
"Increases in oil prices also reduce consumer spending power, in much the same way as when a new excise tax is passed along by oil producers.",2004-09-16
"To the extent that these producers are foreign, there should be a corresponding drop in domestic demand.",2004-09-16
"Even if the oil producers are domestic, a drop in domestic demand could still occur if the producers do not spend as much of their new income as consumers would have or if they do not recycle their profits to shareholders.",2004-09-16
"One approach, often associated with James Hamilton, measures the reduced-form correlation between oil price movements and subsequent movements in unemployment, or output gaps.1 Such an analysis is shown in figure 1, which compares aggregate real oil prices with a measure of the overall output gap.2 The figure shows that since 1973 every upward spike in real oil prices has been followed by a jump in the output gap.",2004-09-16
"However, some of these jumps seem much larger than can be accounted for by oil prices alone, and there appears not to be a symmetric macro response to downward oil price shocks.",2004-09-16
"But this result is still impressive because most of these oil price shocks have been perceived as temporary, as measured by the difference between the oil spot price and far futures price (discussed further below).",2004-09-16
"Presumably, the macroeconomic impact would have been even more powerful for price shocks that were perceived as permanent.",2004-09-16
Hamilton and others have run a series of causality tests to these macro data and do find significant causal effects for oil prices.,2004-09-16
One can also analyze oil price shocks by using structural econometric models.,2004-09-16
These models would typically build in some sort of price-responsiveness behavior to measure pass-through effects.,2004-09-16
They would account for the effects of higher energy prices on the real disposable income and spending demands of the household sector.,2004-09-16
"They would make similar calculations for business investment, working out the impact of oil prices on the cost of capital and business-cash flows, to the extent that these influence overall investment spending.",2004-09-16
"When one does all this, as many economists are doing these days, one sees effects of about one-third of 1 percent on unemployment and slightly more for core inflation rates for a permanent shock in the price of oil of $10 a barrel.3 With appropriate transformations, these structural effects appear to be a good bit smaller than the implications of the reduced-form correlations.",2004-09-16
One involves consumers--perhaps a serious oil price shock could affect consumers' confidence or spending plans in a way that would not be captured by working out the effect of normal income and price elasticities.,2004-09-16
Capital investment may also be affected if the oil price shock encourages producers to substitute less-energy-intensive capital for more-energy-intensive capital.,2004-09-16
"Of course, such a substitution will not necessarily lower aggregate demand if it requires more investment demand for new energy-saving equipment.",2004-09-16
How Should Monetary Policy Respond to Oil Price Shocks?,2004-09-16
"Monetary policy makers in this country have a dual mandate, to stabilize prices and to maximize sustainable employment in the long run.",2004-09-16
Their response to oil price increases should focus on these two objectives.,2004-09-16
"At one extreme, monetary policy makers might focus exclusively on the demand-reducing effect of oil shocks and try to stabilize unemployment rates.",2004-09-16
The risk from this approach is that prices would rise the full amount implied by the shock and would more likely be passed through into further wage and price increases.,2004-09-16
Continuing inflation rates could bump up the full amount of the initial boost in inflation.,2004-09-16
"The continuing inflationary potential from the oil price shock would, in effect, be maximized.",2004-09-16
"At the other extreme, monetary policy makers could focus exclusively on neutralizing the initial impact of the shock on inflation.",2004-09-16
"Given the initial oil price shock, this approach would entail reducing demand enough to stabilize overall, or core, inflation rates.",2004-09-16
"If prices were at all sluggish in their response to changes in unemployment, this approach could entail large increases in unemployment from the shock.",2004-09-16
"If, for example, monetary policy makers tried to keep overall nominal income on a steady path, the direct rise in nominal income from the oil price shock would be met by a fall in real income from somewhat higher unemployment.",2004-09-16
The result would be a temporary rise in both inflation and unemployment.,2004-09-16
"Because the temporary rise in unemployment would damp price pressures, the chances that the initial oil price inflation would pass through into continuing inflation would be reduced.",2004-09-16
"Most likely, the initial inflationary boost would prove temporary, permitting the rise in unemployment to be temporary as well.",2004-09-16
"First, since a large share of U.S. oil is imported, a significant difference could exist between the value-added price deflator comprising nominal income and more-appropriate measures of true consumer price inflation.",2004-09-16
Monetary policy makers would be better off focusing directly on these more-appropriate measures.,2004-09-16
"Second, as before, if prices were highly sensitive to supply shocks but not sensitive to output movements, even nominal income targeting could imply substantial increases in unemployment.",2004-09-16
A better approach would be to follow a policy rule based directly on target values of unemployment and some appropriate measure of inflation.,2004-09-16
"One example is a Taylor rule, under which monetary policy makers would move the short-term target interest rate--the federal funds rate in the United States--up or down to respond to deviations in core inflation and unemployment from their target values.4 The results would be qualitatively similar to those of the nominal income targeting rule, with a temporary rise in both inflation and unemployment, though the increases would now be more keyed to underlying monetary policy objectives.",2004-09-16
"If it did, the nominal funds rate would first rise and then fall with the inflation rate itself.",2004-09-16
"Were policy to try to avoid any rise in unemployment, the initial oil price shock might get passed through to continuing inflation.",2004-09-16
"Were policy to try to avoid any rise in inflation, the movement in unemployment would be substantial.",2004-09-16
"The best approach is likely to be to accept some temporary rise in both inflation and unemployment, with the increases being based on underlying objectives.",2004-09-16
The rises would be temporary so long as inflation did not persistently deviate from its long-term price-stability target.,2004-09-16
"As shown in figure 2, the spot price of oil (solid line) has recently spiked up, as it has several times since 1985.5 But in contrast to most other oil-price-spike episodes, this time the far futures price of oil--that is, the price for contracts seven years out--has also risen sharply.",2004-09-16
This correlation seems to indicate that the present oil price increase is not viewed as a purely temporary shock.,2004-09-16
"At the same time, as shown in figure 3, which plots the difference between the spot price and the futures price, the current price is still greater than the far futures price, representing a phenomenon known as backwardation.6 Because of such backwardation, this oil price shock still seems to have an important temporary component.",2004-09-16
"Today, the high price of oil is much more likely to be due to demand growth in the United States, China, India, and other countries.",2004-09-16
Does the source matter when trying to determine how monetary policy should respond?,2004-09-16
"If the demand growth that caused the oil price increases is domestic, it could mean that the price shock might be less permanent.",2004-09-16
The high oil prices would themselves cut into demand growth and tend to stabilize the system.,2004-09-16
"If the demand growth is foreign, say from China and India, this feedback effect is still present but damped.",2004-09-16
Even foreign demand for oil might be influenced by reduced demand growth in the United States and its trading partners.,2004-09-16
"It is certainly possible that oil shocks partially motivated by demand may be less permanent than true supply shocks, though that reasoning is contradicted by current-day oil futures prices.",2004-09-16
"It is not much of a silver lining, but the present price burst might provide some information on the qualitative difference between domestic and international demand and supply shocks.",2004-09-16
"As figure 1 shows, even the present high real price of oil is only about half the real price in 1980, and the importance of energy in the overall economy is also less than half what it was then.",2004-09-16
"At the same time, figure 2 suggests that the permanent oil price rise is on the order of $15 a barrel.",2004-09-16
"Since the United States now imports 4.5 billion barrels of oil per year, this price rise makes for an effective reduction in domestic income of $68 billion.",2004-09-16
"To the extent that dollars going to domestic oil producers are not fully recycled, the effective demand reduction could be even greater.",2004-09-16
"The rise in consumer prices from all these sources, as well as the reduction in aggregate demand, could be noticeable.",2004-09-16
A final issue involves the initial position of the economy and monetary policy.,2004-09-16
"In the usual exercise, one analyzes the economy in some sort of equilibrium position and posits an oil price shock, which normally results in the temporary increases in inflation and unemployment described earlier.",2004-09-16
"When monetary policy begins with inordinately low nominal interest rates, the reasoning becomes more complicated.",2004-09-16
"Now the response to the oil shock is, in effect, superimposed on any re-equilibration process built in for monetary policy.",2004-09-16
"Without the oil shock, policymakers beginning from a period of low interest rates would try to keep the economy on an even growth path as they gradually raised nominal interest rates.",2004-09-16
"With the shocks, nominal rates would still likely follow an upward path, though the economic reactions would be bumpier, with temporary rises in both inflation and unemployment.",2004-09-16
"Conclusion As a new economic event of the 1970s, oil price shocks forced monetary policy makers to rethink all their rules and added new chapters to macroeconomic textbooks.",2004-09-16
"Today the question of how to respond to oil price spikes is better understood, but the outcomes are no more pleasant.",2004-09-16
"I will focus my remarks today on the use of explicit forward guidance as a tool for monetary policy.1 Before I start, let me briefly discuss near-term monetary policy.",2022-10-12
"Inflation is much too high, and I strongly believe that bringing inflation back to our target is a necessary condition for meeting the goals mandated by Congress of price stability and maximum employment on a sustainable basis.",2022-10-12
"At this point, for me, it comes down to what the incoming data and other economic information will tell us about the outlook for inflation.",2022-10-12
"If we do not see signs that inflation is moving down, my view continues to be that sizable increases in the target range for the federal funds rate should remain on the table.",2022-10-12
"However, if inflation starts to decline, I believe a slower pace of rate increases would be appropriate.",2022-10-12
"To bring inflation down in a consistent and lasting way, the federal funds rate will need to move up to a restrictive level and remain there for some time.",2022-10-12
"However, it is not yet clear how high we will need to raise the federal funds rate and how much time will pass before we begin to see inflation moving back down in a consistent and lasting way.",2022-10-12
"My general point is that inflation is much too high, and the outlook for inflation remains significantly uncertain.",2022-10-12
I have participated in a number of these stimulating conferences since I was in graduate school in the 1980s and have learned a lot from them as my thinking on monetary economics and monetary policy has evolved.,2006-11-16
"In the United States and in virtually every country around the world, inflation has declined, and in most countries dramatically so.",2006-11-16
"In addition, the volatility of inflation and expectations of future inflation have also fallen significantly.",2006-11-16
I will call these changes experienced around the globe the conquest of worldwide inflation.,2006-11-16
I will begin by providing a few facts about the substantial improvement of inflation during roughly the past decade compared with the quarter century that preceded it.,2006-11-16
I will then try to understand why this remarkable decline in inflation has taken place.,2006-11-16
"In particular, I argue that globalization, deregulation, and financial innovation, in part spurred by experiences of high inflation in the 1980s, have fostered currency competition that has led to improved central bank performance and, hence, the recent conquest of worldwide inflation.",2006-11-16
The increased competition among currencies has changed the ability and the incentives of governments and central banks to pursue high-inflation policies.,2006-11-16
"As I will argue, such changes have allowed improvements in central bank independence, governance and credibility, thereby leading to better inflation outcomes.",2006-11-16
"In addition, greater central bank credibility has allowed the development of long-term bond markets in many countries where such markets did not previously exist and flattened of yield curves around the globe as concerns about future inflation risks declined.",2006-11-16
The important issue is whether the conquest of worldwide inflation will persist or be a temporary phenomenon.,2006-11-16
"The Worldwide Decline in Inflation From the 1950s until the late 1960s, inflation rates were relatively contained, and episodes of high inflation were rare.",2006-11-16
"Following the collapse of the Bretton Woods fixed-exchange-rate system in the early 1970s, however, inflation became a worldwide phenomenon.",2006-11-16
"Even in Germany, where prices had been the most stable of any country in the world as tracked by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the purchasing power of the deutsche mark declined by more than half between 1972 and 1995.2 For the United States, purchasing power declined more than 70 percent over this period.",2006-11-16
"To express this erosion in terms of cumulative inflation, $370 would be required today in the United Sates to purchase $100 worth of goods and services at 1972 prices.",2006-11-16
Brazil has by far had the worst experience of any country in the world during this period: The price level in Brazil is approximately 5 trillion times higher today than it was in 1972.,2006-11-16
"Since the early 1990s, however, worldwide inflation has significantly declined.",2006-11-16
"In the advanced economies, for instance, the median inflation rate has fallen from 7 percent in the 1980s to 2 percent in the current decade.",2006-11-16
"In emerging markets, the median inflation rate has fallen from 9 percent to 4 percent over the same period.",2006-11-16
"Indeed, the latest issue of the International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook shows that average inflation rates in both the advanced economies and the developing countries in recent years are at their lowest levels since at least the early 1970s.3 Indeed, the worst performers over the past five years have had inflation outcomes close to the average outcome in the 1970s.4 Thus, the worst inflation today is not nearly as bad as it once was.",2006-11-16
"To give some specific examples, just ten or twenty years ago, annual inflation rates in Brazil and Mexico exceeded 100 percent.",2006-11-16
"But during the past five to ten years, Brazilian and Mexican inflation rates have remained low.",2006-11-16
"In particular, inflation in Brazil failed to spike after Brazil experienced financial crises and sharp currency depreciations in the late 1990s.",2006-11-16
"Given Brazil's history of hyperinflation, this stability is especially remarkable.",2006-11-16
"Brazil did experience an uptick of inflation around its presidential election in 2002, but even this was minor by historical standards.",2006-11-16
"This pattern of reduced inflation is seen across many countries, large and small, developed and developing.",2006-11-16
The data thus clearly show that better inflation performance in the last decade is a worldwide phenomenon.,2006-11-16
But is this lower inflation regime likely to persist?,2006-11-16
One way to approach this issue is to investigate whether market participants appear to believe that this change is temporary or likely to last by examining measures of expected inflation.,2006-11-16
"In the United States, where surveys go back furthest, long-term inflation expectations were as high as 8 percent in the early 1980s; they dropped to about 3 percent a decade ago and have since edged down a bit more, to about 2-1/2 percent, depending on your favorite measure of expectation.5 Over the past ten years, other advanced economies and a few emerging markets such as Korea have had a broadly similar experience.6 In Brazil and Mexico, for example, long-term inflation expectations have declined from a range of 7 percent to 10 percent a decade ago to a fairly steady 3 percent to 4 percent in recent years.",2006-11-16
"Considering the high rates of inflation that these economies experienced not long ago, the low level and stability of long-term inflation expectations in recent years is remarkable.",2006-11-16
"Indeed, few long-term inflation forecasts in any country currently exceed 5 percent, although Venezuela provides one counterexample, with a long-term inflation forecast now of 15 percent.",2006-11-16
"Overall, these surveys suggest that market participants do expect low inflation to persist around the globe.",2006-11-16
"In addition, the risks of high inflation appear to have decreased as well.",2006-11-16
"In particular, the volatility of inflation has declined notably almost everywhere.",2006-11-16
The standard deviation of inflation in the United States declined from as much as 4 percent in the early 1980s to around 1 percent a decade ago and has remained close to that level since then.7 Other advanced economies have had a similar experience.,2006-11-16
"In the early to mid 1990s, the standard deviation of inflation in Brazil at times exceeded 100 percent and in Mexico it exceeded 30 percent.",2006-11-16
"In the current decade, however, the standard deviation of Brazilian inflation has been relatively stable at around 5 percent, while the standard deviation of inflation in Mexico has declined steadily to around 2 percent, a level similar to that experienced in the advanced economies.",2006-11-16
Factors Behind the Conquest of Worldwide Inflation My brief review of worldwide inflation performance suggests that something has changed in the past decade compared with the previous two decades: Inflation is substantially lower and less volatile and expectations of future inflation are also substantially lower.,2006-11-16
"What has driven this change, which I call the conquest of worldwide inflation?8 In understanding the key factors behind this change, we can also shed further light on the likelihood of whether this low inflation regime will persist.",2006-11-16
"In a nutshell, I believe that the factors of globalization, deregulation, and financial innovation, arising partly in response to episodes of high inflation, have effectively eroded the central bank monopoly on the provision of monetary services and have enhanced global competition among currencies.",2006-11-16
"The resulting constraint on monetary policy, combined with increased public understanding of the costs of inflation, have led to institutional changes in central bank governance that bolster their credibility for maintaining price stability in the future.",2006-11-16
"To develop this explanation in more detail, I will start by describing how globalization, deregulation, and innovation can alter the ability and incentive of a government to pursue a high-inflation policy.9 These factors are closely related and mutually reinforcing in many respects.",2006-11-16
"Prompted in part by the collapse of central planning, many countries have turned increasingly to private markets and trade to deliver growth and progress.",2006-11-16
How does this affect inflation?,2006-11-16
"When governments resort to printing money to finance their spending, inflation rises and nominal assets lose their value.",2006-11-16
This loss of value is also known as the inflation tax.,2006-11-16
"Globalization, deregulation, and innovation make it easier for citizens to move their wealth out of nominal assets in the local currency should their government resort to an inflation tax.",2006-11-16
"The demand for local currency has become much more sensitive to the inflation rate, and this greater sensitivity reduces the amount of real resources that the government can obtain for a given level of inflation.",2006-11-16
"Therefore, the government has a reduced incentive to resort to the inflation tax.",2006-11-16
"The specific channels by which globalization, deregulation, and financial innovation affect competition among currencies are many: Increased circulation of banknotes in dollars or other hard currencies enable citizens to conduct transactions and store liquid wealth without holding inflationary currency.",2006-11-16
"The fraction of U.S. currency estimated to be held in foreign countries rose dramatically from less than 20 percent in 1980 to almost 50 percent in the late 1990s, and it has remained near this high level even as inflation rates have come down almost everywhere.",2006-11-16
"Advances in electronic payments systems and trading systems, both retail and wholesale, enable consumers, investors, and banks to shift wealth cheaply and quickly away from currencies and assets subject to inflation and related risks.",2006-11-16
"Over the past decade or so, many emerging-market economies have adopted technologies already in use in the advanced economies.10 As financial innovations such as credit card networks and money market mutual funds become more widespread, particularly in economies that had experienced high inflations, households and firms have been able to reduce their holdings of cash and central bank reserves, thus shrinking the ""base"" for the inflation tax.",2006-11-16
"Given such developments that facilitate competition among currencies, a government that pressures a central bank to pursue an inflationary policy gets much less benefit from increased inflation because people can more rapidly and conveniently switch out of the local currency.",2006-11-16
"Indeed, the web site of the central bank of Brazil explicitly acknowledges the role of inflation in driving financial innovations that enabled firms and households to economize on cash balances in that country.",2006-11-16
"It states, ""Prior to the mid-1990s, [when inflation was stabilized] changes in the payment system in Brazil were motivated by the need to cope with high inflation rates.",2006-11-16
"""11 In addition to encouraging financial innovation, the painful experience of high inflation helped to educate the public and economists about the costs of inflation.12 Although the specific experiences differed across countries, almost everywhere public opinion eventually turned against allowing inflation to continue, and this public pressure reinforced the trend against inflationary policies.",2006-11-16
"Economists and central bankers also devoted great attention to understanding the causes and consequences of inflation, providing the intellectual underpinning to policies oriented toward price stability.",2006-11-16
"In many countries, the factors I have discussed here led to changes in central banks that may make it more difficult to revert to high-inflation policies.",2006-11-16
The most notable change is the increased independence of many central banks and the correspondingly reduced control of the fiscal authorities over monetary policy.,2006-11-16
"Central bank independence reduces the ability of a government to ""rob the piggy bank"" through a surprise inflation tax.",2006-11-16
"But having to resort to such a vote is a greater obstacle to inflationary finance than that posed by previous arrangements, especially given the public's increased sensitivity and aversion to inflation.",2006-11-16
Central bank independence has typically been granted in conjunction with an explicit mandate that makes the achievement of low and stable inflation one of the goals of monetary policy.,2006-11-16
"Central bank independence, together with a mandate that includes price stability, increases the credibility of monetary policy.",2006-11-16
"When citizens are more aware of the costs of inflation, and when governments are less able to reap benefits from high inflation and thus have less incentive to use the central bank as a piggy bank, institutional reforms that make central banks more credible and independent are more likely to be adopted and sustained.13 The fundamental forces I have described today--globalization, deregulation, financial innovation, and public understanding about the costs of inflation--provided the impetus for fighting inflation and opened the political path to institutional reforms, such as central bank independence, that enhance central bank credibility.",2006-11-16
"Once in place, these reforms made further progress against inflation easier and raised the costs of backsliding.",2006-11-16
"As the benefits of stable prices accrue and as financial markets deepen and become more sophisticated, the benefits of sound economic policies will help to create support for institutional reforms that make returning to inflation harder--but not impossible--for future governments.",2006-11-16
Implications of the Conquest for Bond Markets What are the implications of the conquest of worldwide inflation for interest rates and yield curves?,2006-11-16
I believe that market confidence in continued low inflation has helped drive down the slope of the yield curve by reducing the premium demanded for holding long-term nominal assets.,2006-11-16
"The conquest of inflation also has extended bond maturities and yield curves further into the future than ever before, most notably in many emerging markets.",2006-11-16
We know that the short end of the yield curve is dominated by monetary policy and cyclical factors.,2006-11-16
"The forward rate reflects not only the market expectation of the future short-term interest rate but also a ""term premium"" to compensate for the risk of a commitment to extend credit so far in the future, including the risk of future inflation.",2006-11-16
"Chairman Bernanke has suggested that an excess of ex ante global saving relative to global investment has held down real interest rates around the world.16 Some of the factors behind this excess of saving over investment include the surge in revenues of oil and commodity exporters, a retreat in Asian investment demand from the boom that preceded the late 1990s, and a reduction in fiscal deficits in some Latin American countries.",2006-11-16
"The declines in inflation rates, in the volatility of inflation, and in surveys of long-term inflation expectations all point to a reduction in the compensation required by investors for the effects of future inflation on the returns to holding long-term bonds.",2006-11-16
"This development is particularly remarkable in many emerging markets, in which longer-dated fixed-coupon bonds issued in local currencies had ceased to exist during the inflationary 1970s and 1980s.",2006-11-16
"The recent lengthening of maturities of domestic-currency-debt markets has, in many cases, not only extended the yield curve but--and this is one of the key results of the conquest of inflation--effectively created a local-currency yield curve that previously did not exist.",2006-11-16
"In addition to the development or extension of a yield curve worldwide, bond yields have tended to be relatively low and flat, at least in part because of the conquest of inflation.",2006-11-16
"Overall, the combination of lower and less volatile inflation around the world has led to a reduction in inflation expectations and lower perceived inflation risk, and hence to a lower premium in long rates for inflation uncertainty.",2006-11-16
The establishment of markets for long-term nominal government and corporate debt in countries in which they did not exist a decade ago is powerful evidence of the faith that investors place in a future environment of price stability.,2006-11-16
Broader Economic Benefits The economic benefits of price stability are too numerous and well known for me to cover here in detail.,2006-11-16
Long-run price stability certainly is essential for achieving maximum employment.,2006-11-16
Price stability boosts growth by deepening financial markets.,2006-11-16
"Given stable prices, savers and investors have more confidence about the ultimate value of their investments.",2006-11-16
Stable prices encourage the growth of financial intermediaries and financial markets.,2006-11-16
"There is a strong positive link between banking and financial market development and economic growth, and a number of studies have concluded that banking and financial market development is a key driver of economic growth.",2006-11-16
Higher and more stable growth combined with better ability to undertake long-term plans can help to improve the fiscal outlook for a country.,2006-11-16
"A better fiscal outlook, in turn, increases confidence and financial market development and thus further boosts growth and, in a virtuous cycle, reinforces prospects for continued price stability.",2006-11-16
"More-prudent fiscal policies, including lower deficits, longer debt maturities, and reduced foreign-currency debt can reduce the likelihood and potential severity of financial crises.",2006-11-16
These policies make the financial positions of emerging-market governments less vulnerable to movements in interest rates and exchange rates.,2006-11-16
"Maintaining Progress on the Conquest of Worldwide Inflation I have argued that globalization, deregulation, and financial innovation, in part spurred by recent experiences of high inflation, have fostered currency competition that has led to improved central bank performance and, hence, the conquest of worldwide inflation.",2006-11-16
"Barriers to the free flow of goods, services, capital, and technology would also diminish the force of innovation that has been so beneficial in the struggle against inflation.",2006-11-16
High inflation can destroy an economy and result in enormous hardship for everyone involved.,2006-11-16
I believe that we must continue to work hard to lock in the gains achieved through anti-inflation credibility to ensure that the conquest will be long lasting.,2006-11-16
This agreement is reflected both in the mandates set for monetary policy by governments and in the practice of central banks.,2001-07-17
Several other important questions about the objectives for monetary policy are less settled: Should there be other objectives?,2001-07-17
A hierarchical mandate makes price stability the primary objective for monetary policy and subordinates other potential objectives.,2001-07-17
A dual mandate recognizes two objectives--price stability and full employment--and puts them on an equal footing.,2001-07-17
Either regime could make the price stability objective more precise by setting an explicit numerical target for inflation.,2001-07-17
"Thus we can describe a typical central bank's mandate and objectives in terms of two sets of alternatives: between a hierarchical or a dual mandate, on the one hand, and an implicit or explicit inflation objective, on the other hand.",2001-07-17
"During the 1990s, a number of central banks adopted a framework that is called inflation targeting, combining a hierarchical mandate and an explicit inflation objective.",2001-07-17
"The United States, in contrast, combines a dual mandate and an implicit inflation objective.",2001-07-17
"Most of the discussion in the United States on the subject of mandates and objectives has been about whether to identify inflation as the single or primary objective and whether to move to a formal inflation-targeting regime.1 The title of my lecture--""Inflation Targets and Inflation Targeting""--is intended to differentiate between two options for changing the policy mandate for the Federal Reserve.",2001-07-17
"The first option, which I favor, is setting an explicit numerical target for inflation within the context of our current dual mandate.",2001-07-17
"The second option, which I do not favor, is moving to an inflation-targeting regime, that is, also substituting a hierarchical mandate for our current dual mandate.",2001-07-17
The purpose of this lecture is therefore to explain the benefits of an explicit inflation target in the context of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate and to set out the operational steps for implementing such a target.,2001-07-17
The Evolution of Monetary Policy Mandates A good starting point is a survey of mandates around the world.,2001-07-17
"I will begin by discussing the evolution of the mandate in the United States, including the precise language related to the dual mandate, the way in which the price stability objective has been interpreted, and proposed legislation that would have amended the mandate.",2001-07-17
Then I sketch an inflation-targeting regime and discuss some common elements and differences among the inflation-targeting regimes of developed economies around the world.,2001-07-17
"The Evolution of Policy Objectives in the United States In the United States, it took quite some time for the Congress to establish a precise set of objectives for monetary policy.",2001-07-17
"The absence of any mention of price stability undoubtedly reflected confidence that the gold standard, under which the United States was operating, would promote price stability.",2001-07-17
The intent of providing an elastic currency and of rediscounting commercial paper was to expand the supply of money and credit to accommodate expansions in production and the accompanying demand for credit.,2001-07-17
"On several occasions during the 1920s and 1930s, the Congress debated a price-stability objective for the Fed.",2001-07-17
Congress did take a step toward a more explicit treatment of policy objectives in the Employment Act of 1946.,2001-07-17
"The objectives identified in the act were ""to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power.""",2001-07-17
"Although this set of objectives could be interpreted as including both full employment and price stability, the title of the bill and the specific language suggests that the priority at the time was more to maintain full employment than to promote price stability.",2001-07-17
"Such a focus on stabilizing employment and a relative inattention to inflation was perhaps an understandable reaction to the Great Depression when, for a decade, high unemployment and falling prices were the major problems facing the U.S. economy.",2001-07-17
"The 1977 amendment required the Board of Governors and the FOMC to ""maintain the growth of monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy's long-run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.""",2001-07-17
This language makes the objective of price stability explicit.,2001-07-17
"Because the Fed can contribute to moderate long-term interest rates principally by achieving low and stable inflation, that objective is generally not viewed as an independent one.",2001-07-17
"In addition, the goal of maximum employment is usually interpreted as maximum sustainable employment--meaning the highest level of employment that can be maintained without upward pressure on inflation.",2001-07-17
The mandate is therefore interpreted as a dual mandate: full employment and price stability.,2001-07-17
"The Federal Reserve has not set an explicit, numerical objective for inflation.",2001-07-17
"Paul Volcker offered the following definition of price stability in 1983: A workable definition of reasonable ""price stability"" would seem to me to be a situation in which expectations of generally rising (or falling) prices over a considerable period are not a pervasive influence on economic and financial behavior.",2001-07-17
"Stated more positively, ""stability"" would imply that decisionmaking should be able to proceed on the basis that ""real"" and ""nominal"" values are substantially the same over the planning horizon--and that planning horizons should be suitably long.2 Alan Greenspan has described the price stability objective in a similar way: We will be at price stability when households and businesses need not factor expectations of changes in the average level of prices into their decisions.3 These definitions make clear a commitment to low inflation.",2001-07-17
"But they leave open whether, for example, the inflation rate prevailing today--about 2-1/2 percent for the core consumer price index (CPI) measure of consumer prices--is consistent with this definition.",2001-07-17
"Is policy going to be set to lower inflation over time, and if so, by how much?",2001-07-17
The Fed often prefers to state its objective without specifically mentioning price stability.,2001-07-17
This is perhaps because the emphasis on price stability is taken by some as carrying a hint of restrictive policy and as an inclination to always be leaning against cyclical increases in demand.,2001-07-17
The Fed sometimes prefers to state its objective simply as promoting maximum sustainable growth.,2001-07-17
Stating its objective in this way allows the Fed to offer a more positive message and leaves implicit the price stability objective in two ways.,2001-07-17
"First, if the economy were to grow above a sustainable rate for long enough, overheating and higher inflation would eventually follow.",2001-07-17
"Second, price stability contributes to a high and perhaps faster rate of growth in productive capacity, a point I will return to below.",2001-07-17
"Nevertheless, I prefer to state the Fed's objectives as full employment and price stability.",2001-07-17
"In my view, the Fed has no growth objective.",2001-07-17
"At full employment, the rate of growth will automatically be the maximum sustainable rate the economy is capable of achieving and a rate largely independent of monetary policy, except insofar as monetary policy is successful in achieving price stability.",2001-07-17
"In recent years, bills have been introduced on a few occasions that would have made price stability the sole or primary objective for monetary policy and required the Fed to set an explicit numerical inflation target.",2001-07-17
"In 1989, 1991, and 1993, Representative Steve Neal, Chairman of the House Banking Committee's Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy, introduced resolutions instructing the Federal Reserve ""to adopt and pursue monetary policies leading to, and then maintaining, zero inflation.""",2001-07-17
"In the 1991 and 1993 versions, zero inflation was defined as ""when the expected rate of change of the general level of prices ceases to be a factor in individual and business decisionmaking.""",2001-07-17
"While these resolutions did not pass, the definition of price stability in the 1991 and 1993 resolutions was, undoubtedly not by accident, nearly identical to the language used by Chairman Greenspan and to the concept articulated earlier by Chairman Volcker.",2001-07-17
"These bills instructed the Fed to set an explicit numerical definition of price stability and to ""maintain a monetary policy that effectively promotes long-term price stability.""",2001-07-17
"Representative Saxton introduced a significantly revised version of these bills in 1997 and 1999, mandating price stability as the ""primary goal"" of the Federal Reserve and requiring the Fed to establish an explicit numerical definition of inflation.",2001-07-17
I interpret these bills as attempts to push the United States toward a full inflation-targeting regime.,2001-07-17
"Indeed, the Mack versions would establish an inflation-targeting regime among the strictest in the world, given that it would have established price stability as the sole objective of monetary policy, not simply a hierarchical set of objectives.",2001-07-17
The Saxton version is more in line with hierarchical mandates employed in many inflation-targeting regimes.,2001-07-17
"Perhaps because these bills formed the backdrop to the debate in the United States about the policy mandate, little discussion has taken place on the merits of moving to an explicit numerical inflation target in the context of the prevailing dual mandate.",2001-07-17
B. Mandates in Inflation-Targeting Regimes New Zealand in 1990 became the first country to establish a formal inflation-targeting regime.,2001-07-17
"Subsequently, Finland and Spain adopted inflation targeting (before becoming members of the European Monetary Union) and in the last few years several developing countries have adopted this approach.",2001-07-17
"Although the European Central Bank does not identify itself as an inflation-targeting regime, the Maastricht Treaty set price stability as the ECB's primary objective and the ECB has set an explicit numerical target for inflation.",2001-07-17
What Is an Inflation-Targeting Regime?,2001-07-17
"Inflation-targeting regimes generally identify price stability as the primary objective, usually in the context of a hierarchical mandate.",2001-07-17
"They set an explicit numerical target for inflation and set a period over which any deviation of inflation from its target is to be eliminated, although some regimes provide escape clauses and other flexibility related to the pace of return to price stability.",2001-07-17
The inflation target is sometimes set as a point and sometimes as a range.,2001-07-17
"In most cases, the inflation objective is set for a measure of overall consumer price inflation, the point or midpoint of the ranges is generally around 2 percent, and the ranges (where employed) are generally 2 percentage points wide--typically 1 percent to 3 percent.",2001-07-17
"The time period prescribed for return to the inflation target following departures is sometimes explicit and sometimes not, generally in the range of eighteen months to two years.",2001-07-17
"Examples of Inflation-Targeting Regimes In New Zealand, the first inflation-targeting regime, the numerical target is set jointly by the Minister of Finance and the Governor of the central bank and is currently a range of 0 percent to 3 percent, the widest of any of the ranges in inflation-targeting regimes.",2001-07-17
"New Zealand is quite well-known for establishing performance contracts for government officials, and this approach is followed in the law governing the operation of the central bank: The statute allows the governor to be dismissed if inflation performance is inadequate.",2001-07-17
The Bank of Canada operates under the vaguest legal mandate among inflation-targeting central banks.,2001-07-17
"Despite the absence of a precise legal mandate, the details of the Bank's monetary policy objectives are reached by agreement between the Bank and the Department of Finance.",2001-07-17
This agreement has set price stability as the principal objective for monetary policy.,2001-07-17
"To implement this objective, the agreement sets the range for inflation as 1 percent to 3 percent and identifies the midpoint as the explicit target.",2001-07-17
"Their legislative mandate is ""to [promote] stability of the currency of Australia;…[maintain] full employment in Australia; and…[foster] economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia.""",2001-07-17
"The explicit inflation target, 2 percent to 3 percent, is set by the central bank and applies to the average inflation rate over a business cycle.",2001-07-17
"Although Australia is counted among inflation-targeting countries, it has a dual mandate rather than a hierarchical one.",2001-07-17
"Indeed, it is a model for the combination I prefer: an explicit inflation target within a dual mandate.",2001-07-17
"Article 11 of the Bank of England Act sets the objectives for monetary policy as ""to maintain price stability"" and ""subject to that, to support the economic policy of Her Majesty's Government, including its objectives for growth and employment.""",2001-07-17
"The explicit target, set by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (the equivalent of the Minister of Finance in many countries or the Secretary of the Treasury in the United States), is currently 2.5 percent and the target is for retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments.",2001-07-17
The Governor of the Bank of England must write a letter to the Chancellor if inflation deviates by more than 1 percentage point from the target.,2001-07-17
The ECB does not view itself as an inflation-targeting central bank.,2001-07-17
"However, the Maastricht Treaty--the equivalent of the statute establishing the objectives for a central bank--identifies price stability as the principal objective in the context of a hierarchical mandate.",2001-07-17
"Article 105 of the Maastricht Treaty states that ""the primary objective of the [European System of Central Banks (ESCB)] shall be to maintain price stability.",2001-07-17
"Without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the community with a view to contributing to the objectives of the Community laid down in Article 2.""",2001-07-17
"The objectives mentioned in Article 2 include ""sustainable and non-inflationary growth,"" a ""high level of employment,"" and ""raising the standard of living"" among member states.",2001-07-17

"The Evolution of Inflation-Targeting Regimes Over their short history, inflation-targeting regimes have evolved to give central banks greater flexibility in conducting monetary policy.",2001-07-17
"Mervyn King calls regimes which take no account of output gaps (where the coefficient on the output gap is zero in the loss function) ""inflation nutters.",2001-07-17
"Lars Svensson argues that there has, in fact, been a convergence toward ""flexible inflation targeting""--meaning inflation-targeting regimes that in practice take into account deviations in both output and inflation from their respective targets.5 Such an evolution has brought many inflation-targeting regimes closer in practice to a dual mandate regime.",2001-07-17
The Case for a Dual Mandate The appropriate goals for monetary policy depend on the structure of the economy and the preferences of the citizenry.,2001-07-17
"These can be summarized as follows: Low and stable inflation (""price stability"") is essential to good macroeconomic performance and hence should be an objective of macroeconomic policy.",2001-07-17
The central bank is uniquely responsible for the inflation rate in the long run.,2001-07-17
Monetary policy can make some contribution to lowering the variability of output relative to potential.,2001-07-17
The public desires both low and stable inflation and a low variability of output relative to potential.,2001-07-17
"Price Stability as a Policy Objective As I noted at the outset, it is widely agreed that low and stable inflation is desirable.",2001-07-17
Several costs of high and variable inflation have been identified.,2001-07-17
These costs typically arise from distortions in economic decisionmaking arising from high or variable inflation rates and result in lower levels of output than would otherwise be the case.,2001-07-17
"I won't elaborate in detail about these costs here, because I take as a starting point the agreement that price stability is an important, if not the singular objective for monetary policy.6 But the key point is that price stability is not an end in itself; it is important because it contributes to a higher level of output and perhaps faster growth in output.",2001-07-17
"Monetary Policy and Inflation Few economists would disagree that inflation is, as Milton Friedman taught us long ago, always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.",2001-07-17
This was earlier interpreted as a statement about a tight relationship between money growth (controlled by the central bank) and inflation.,2001-07-17
"Today, it is recognized that even if the relationship between money growth and inflation has weakened, perhaps because of financial innovations, central banks can achieve their inflation targets by adjusting their preferred instrument, typically some short-term interest rate.",2001-07-17
"Hence, monetary policy still determines the rate of inflation in the long run.",2001-07-17
"While it is also well understood that supply shocks--such as abrupt changes in the price of energy or food unrelated to the overall balance between aggregate demand and supply--can result in short-run changes in inflation, such changes in inflation can persist only if central banks accommodate them.",2001-07-17
Central banks therefore must accept full responsibility for inflation in the long run and have the tools to achieve price stability.,2001-07-17
"The Ability to Stabilize Output While monetary policy can achieve a long-run inflation target, economic theory suggests that it cannot affect the level of output or its growth rate in the long run, other than by maintaining low and stable inflation.",2001-07-17
"Therefore, the objective of price stability should be assigned to monetary policymakers, but the objective of high and rising living standards should not be.",2001-07-17
"On the other hand, the Congress and the Administration have many opportunities to affect the level and growth in potential output--including the size of the structural budget deficit relative to output, the details of the tax code, and the composition of government spending.",2001-07-17
"Economists agree that monetary policy cannot ""fine tune"" the economy to ensure that the full employment objective is continuously maintained.",2001-07-17
"However, a considerable amount of research supports the contention that monetary policy can reduce the variability of output around its full-employment level.7 Preferences Households and businesses are presumed to prefer low and stable inflation to high and variable inflation.",2001-07-17
This is often expressed in terms of a loss function where the loss to society is expressed as a weighted average of squared deviations of inflation from its target and of output from its potential level.,2001-07-17
"The squaring of the deviations ensures that deviations on either side of the target are treated equivalently as losses.8 The weights, a and 1-a, indicate the relative intensity of the public's distaste for deviating from their preferred rates of inflation and output.",2001-07-17
"The loss to society, L, can be expressed as (1) L = a (p - p*)2 + (1-a) (y - y*)2 where p is the rate of inflation, p* is the target rate of inflation, y is the level of output and y* is the target level of output or potential output.",2001-07-17
"Tradeoff between Inflation and Output Variability Although it is possible in principle to achieve price stability and full employment simultaneously, an inevitable tradeoff between the variability of output and the variability of inflation exists.9 This tradeoff is most obvious in the case of a supply shock, for example an abrupt increase in the price of oil.",2001-07-17
"An adverse supply shock typically raises inflation and lowers aggregate demand (by reducing the purchasing power of consumers), thereby moving inflation up and output down.",2001-07-17
This gives rise to a well-known dilemma for monetary policy: Should monetary policy ease to reduce the decline in output or tighten to counter the rise in inflation?,2001-07-17
"The structure of the economy is such that the quicker monetary policy tries to return inflation to its target (to reduce the variability of inflation), the greater the variability in output.",2001-07-17
"That is, countries with hierarchical mandates are more likely to end up with lower inflation variability at the expense of higher output variability.10 A dual mandate, therefore, provides flexibility for the central bank to select the point along this tradeoff that matches the public's preference.",2001-07-17
"Focusing Policymakers on What They Can Achieve An argument often made for a hierarchical mandate is that identifying price stability as the sole or primary objective focuses monetary policy on what it can achieve and, thereby, reduces political pressure to pursue goals that are not achievable.",2001-07-17
"To be sure, wide agreement exists that central banks can achieve low and stable inflation and should be held accountable for doing so.",2001-07-17
There is also agreement that central banks cannot raise the level or growth of potential output (other than through achieving their price stability objective) and should therefore not be held accountable for these dimensions of macroeconomic performance.,2001-07-17
"But the public also cares about the variability of output relative to potential, and the conduct of monetary policy inevitably will affect output variability.",2001-07-17
"Therefore, in my view, the importance of keeping monetary policy focused on what it can do supports the case for a dual mandate that explicitly recognizes both price stability and output stabilization as objectives for monetary policy.",2001-07-17
"It is sometimes argued, however, that price stability can be the only objective for monetary policy in the long run, again placing price stability on a higher plane than full employment.",2001-07-17
"In the long run, theory holds that the economy gravitates to full employment by self-equilibrating forces, principally through the effects of price flexibility.",2001-07-17
"That is, if the economy is operating at a level of output below full employment, the price level will tend to fall, and at least for a given value of the nominal money supply, this will tend to stimulate aggregate demand.",2001-07-17
"Over time, this process will raise aggregate demand to a level consistent with full employment.",2001-07-17
"Hence, policymakers do not have to be concerned with full employment in the long run, leaving price stability as their unique long-run concern.",2001-07-17
"First, monetary policymakers should be concerned about two long-run properties of the economy.",2001-07-17
One is price stability and the other is the variability of output around full employment.,2001-07-17
"A central bank can achieve the inflation target, with considerable precision, in the long run, meaning on average over a period of years.",2001-07-17
But it cannot be expected to maintain the economy continuously at full employment.,2001-07-17
The full employment objective might therefore be better interpreted as an output stabilization objective.,2001-07-17
It instructs the central bank to work to reduce the variability of output around its full employment level.,2001-07-17
"The Need for Flexibility The purpose of a hierarchical mandate is to impose constraints on the operation of monetary policy, constraints that proponents believe enhance credibility, focus policy on what monetary policy can achieve, and reduce political pressures for policy to aim at impossible-to-achieve and potentially destabilizing output goals, such as a level of output above the economy's maximum sustainable rate.",2001-07-17
"However, those same constraints might interfere with the pursuit of other legitimate objectives of monetary policy, specifically with policy adjustments to reduce the variability of output around potential output.",2001-07-17
Most inflation-targeting regimes explicitly recognize that returning inflation to its target too rapidly following some departure could result in excessive variability of output.,2001-07-17
The solution has been to encourage a gradual return to the inflation target by explicitly or implicitly setting a policy horizon over which policymakers commit to return inflation to its target.,2001-07-17
"Setting fixed horizons for the return to the inflation target, independent of the size or the nature of the shock, clearly reduces the flexibility of monetary policy.",2001-07-17
It may therefore interfere with an appropriate balancing of the full-employment and price-stability goals.,2001-07-17
"This is especially the case if the mandate is hierarchical, where other objectives can be pursued only if the inflation objective is achieved.",2001-07-17
"The Taylor Rule and the Dual Mandate The Taylor rule is a useful characterization of U.S. monetary policy.11 According to the Taylor rule, monetary policymakers should adjust the target for the short-term interest rate in response to deviations of output and inflation from their respective targets and in response to changes in inflation.",2001-07-17
"The Taylor rule can be written as (2) R = r* + p + c [(y/y*)-1] + d (p - p*) where R is the target nominal policy rate, r* is the equilibrium real level of the policy rate (consistent with price stability and full employment), y is output, y* is the level of potential output, p is inflation, p* is the target for inflation, and c and d are the parameters that describe the response of the policy rate to deviations of output and inflation from their respective targets.",2001-07-17
"The Taylor rule also helps to make the point that policymakers can operate with an output stabilization goal and still ensure that inflation is, on average, consistent with the inflation target in the long run.12 A strict version of inflation targeting would be one based on a loss function, taking into account only losses associated with inflation deviating from its target.",2001-07-17
"Based on a simple model, we could derive an optimal policy response to shocks, based on this loss function and the more general one where costs are assigned to deviations from both price stability and full employment.",2001-07-17
"If policy is set assuming a = 0 (as would be the case in a very strict inflation-targeting regime), it is clear that policy will be suboptimal if the true loss function does assign a cost to deviating from full employment.13 The more difficult question is: How suboptimal are inflation-targeting regimes that recognize the costs of excessive output variability, but nevertheless constrain monetary policymakers from responding to deviations of output from its target, except when the inflation target has already been met or when policymakers can project that it will be met in a reasonable period?",2001-07-17
"Transparency, Accountability, and the Dual Mandate As I noted, transparency about monetary policy requires a full and accurate account of the objectives.",2001-07-17
"But pretending that inflation is the only objective, while taking account of output variability in practice, only makes for less-transparent policy and ensures that the central bank will have difficulty communicating the rationale for its policy actions.",2001-07-17
"Two foreign central bankers--each from inflation-targeting countries--lectured me about how ""good"" central bankers acted in public.",2001-07-17
They each told me that a disciplined central banker would never admit to having a stabilization objective and never admit that there was a cost of lowering inflation.,2001-07-17
"Such admissions, they warned, would only undermine the public's confidence in a central banker's commitment to price stability.",2001-07-17
I would not have thought obfuscating about policy objectives or the way monetary policy affects the economy would have enhanced the credibility of a policymaker.,2001-07-17
"The Case for an Explicit Inflation Target An explicit inflation target would, in my view, give added precision to an already mandated objective.",2001-07-17
"Three of the arguments for inflation-targeting regimes, it seems to me, also support an explicit inflation target within a dual mandate.",2001-07-17
"First, an explicit inflation target would improve the transparency and accountability of monetary policy.",2001-07-17
"Second, it might help, at the margin, to anchor inflation expectations.",2001-07-17
"Third, it would help to institutionalize recent good monetary policy.",2001-07-17
"Indeed, moving in this direction would extract most of the benefits of an inflation-targeting regime without suffering the loss of flexibility inherent in its hierarchical mandate.",2001-07-17
Improving Transparency and Accountability Transparency is an important goal for monetary policymakers for two reasons.,2001-07-17
"Monetary policy works both through the setting of a target short-term nominal interest rate and by the expectations policymakers induce in the markets, wittingly or unwittingly, about the course of future policy.",2001-07-17
"To the extent that market participants correctly anticipate future policy moves, long-term interest rates will move in response to expectations of future moves in short-term rates, in effect, speeding the response of aggregate demand to monetary policy.",2001-07-17
More precise goals increase both the transparency and the accountability of monetary policy.,2001-07-17
Anchoring Inflation Expectations and Increasing Credibility Anchoring inflation expectations at the targeted rate of inflation is an important goal for monetary policy.,2001-07-17
"However, whether an explicit inflation target or a formal inflation-targeting regime would boost the credibility of the central bank's commitment to price stability is more debatable.",2001-07-17
"In addition, there is little empirical evidence to suggest that either explicit inflation targets or inflation-targeting regimes lower the cost of disinflation by directly lowering inflation expectations.",2001-07-17
"Still, at the margin, such a target might enhance the ability of the Fed to anchor inflation expectations and perhaps also enhance the ability of the Fed to pursue its stabilization objective without undermining the public's confidence in its commitment to low inflation.",2001-07-17
Institutionalizing Good Monetary Policy Most observers would rate monetary policy in the United States over the last two decades as very good.,2001-07-17
The staff has never asked FOMC members about their preferences for a numerical inflation target and instead often employs the target that John Taylor used in the policy rule he introduced in 1993.,2001-07-17
"More important, if the target is implicit, and therefore imprecise, members of the FOMC inevitably will each make policy decisions in pursuit of different inflation targets.",2001-07-17
It seems to me that the internal discussion of policy would be more coherent if policymakers agreed in advance on an inflation objective.,2001-07-17
"There would still be differences in policy preferences at FOMC meetings due, for example, to different views about the economic outlook, different views about the structure of the economy, and different views about the sustainable level of the unemployment rate or the maximum sustainable rate of growth in output.",2001-07-17
"But, provided that all FOMC members agreed to seek the objective chosen by the majority, an explicit target would prevent members from pulling in different directions because of different inflation objectives.",2001-07-17
Retaining Flexibility with the Dual Mandate The key issue for me is whether setting an explicit inflation target would reduce the flexibility of policymakers to pursue a dual mandate and select the preferred point along the tradeoff between output and inflation variability.,2001-07-17
"That is, would making the p* in the Taylor rule explicit inevitably also lead to a change in the relative responses to deviations from the output and inflation targets (the c and d parameters in equation 2)?",2001-07-17
"Specifically, would implementing an explicit inflation target inevitably also raise the response parameter on the inflation gap relative to that on the output gap?",2001-07-17
"It seems to me, however, that it is less likely if the move to an explicit inflation target is taken in the context of a reaffirmation of the dual mandate.",2001-07-17
"If It Ain't Broke, Don't Fix It As I noted above, most observers believe that monetary policy has been excellent in recent years.",2001-07-17
"Why, then, change the underlying framework for policy, especially when this change is not likely to have much of an influence on the conduct of monetary policy?",2001-07-17
The case for moving to an explicit inflation target within our current dual mandate is that it extracts most of the potential benefits of inflation-targeting regimes without necessarily reducing the flexibility of policy.,2001-07-17
"I believe that the Fed remains more responsive to deviations of output from its target than most inflation-targeting central banks, even allowing for the convergence that has been under way.",2001-07-17
"I believe we could retain that flexibility with an explicit inflation target because of our historical commitment to a dual mandate and because there would be no presumption that the fundamental strategy for conducting monetary policy, summarized by the Taylor rule, would change.",2001-07-17
"At the same time, I believe transparency and accountability are appropriate goals for monetary policymakers and that an explicit inflation target would contribute to each of these goals, even if it would not have had much effect on the actual course of policy in recent years.",2001-07-17
Should the Full Employment Objective Be Explicit Also?,2001-07-17
"Some members of the Congress, for example, might encourage the Fed to adopt an explicit objective for full employment to balance an explicit inflation objective.",2001-07-17
"Although I support an explicit objective for inflation, it would not be constructive, in my view, to set an explicit numerical target for full employment.",2001-07-17
"The central bank is capable of achieving an inflation objective, at least on average over a period of years.",2001-07-17
"In contrast, if we define full employment in terms of a threshold for the unemployment rate consistent with maximum sustainable employment, the central bank has no choice about what this threshold should be.14 It is determined by the structure of the economy, including the effectiveness of institutions and markets in matching vacancies and unemployed workers, and by policies, such as the levels of unemployment compensation and minimum wage rates.",2001-07-17
"Because institutions and markets evolve and labor market policies change, it would be inappropriate to set a fixed numerical objective for full employment.",2001-07-17
"That does not rule out central banks being more transparent about their estimate of the unemployment rate that is consistent with maximum sustainable employment, though no central bank has ventured into this territory.",2001-07-17
"Indeed, it would be difficult to do so because there is considerable debate--both inside and outside central banks--about the usefulness of a ""full employment rate of unemployment"" as a guide to policy and, even among those who believe this is an important and useful concept, about what that rate may be today and how it tends to change over time.",2001-07-17
"At times, an increase in the unemployment rate may be required to sustain stable, low inflation.",2001-07-17
Rare is the leader of a monetary policy committee who relishes going to the legislature and reporting that the central bank is concerned that too many people have jobs.,2001-07-17
The uncertainty about the threshold unemployment rate also suggests a differing degree of intensity in the response of monetary policy to deviations of inflation and output to their respective targets.,2001-07-17
That uncertainty derives from our inability to precisely pin down two key parameters--the threshold unemployment rate and the trend rate of growth in potential output.,2001-07-17
"One objective--price stability--can be well defined and is fully under the control of monetary policymakers, at least over a period of time.",2001-07-17
"The other--full employment--is set by the structure of the economy, not policymakers, and cannot be precisely pinned down numerically at any point in time and can vary over time.",2001-07-17
Practical Considerations Let us now assume that a decision has been made to move to an explicit inflation target.,2001-07-17
"Second, a specific price index would have to be selected to serve as the basis for the inflation target.",2001-07-17
Who Should Set the Inflation Target?,2001-07-17
"Among inflation-targeting regimes, there is a mix of practices with respect to who sets the numerical target for inflation.",2001-07-17
"In almost all cases, the government identifies price stability as a target, either as the single target or as part of a hierarchical mandate.",2001-07-17
"In about half the cases, the explicit numerical target for inflation is set by the government, typically the finance ministry, generally in consultation with the central bank; in about half the cases, the target is set by the central bank, often in consultation with the finance ministry.",2001-07-17
The United States already has a mandate that includes price stability.,2001-07-17
The existing law therefore seems to be compatible with the Federal Reserve setting an explicit numerical inflation rate consistent with the notion of price stability.,2001-07-17
Perhaps the setting of an explicit inflation target by the Federal Reserve might be analogous to its earlier setting of numerical money growth ranges.,2001-07-17
"In 1978, the Congress instructed the Fed to report an objective for money growth.",2001-07-17
"In the case of an inflation objective, the Congress has already imposed a price-stability objective.",2001-07-17
"Nevertheless, such a move would likely be interpreted as an important change in the conduct of monetary policy.",2001-07-17
It might also be constructive to get feedback from a wider audience on a proposal to set an explicit inflation target before proceeding in this direction.,2001-07-17
"It would, however, be problematic for the United States to follow the approach in many inflation-targeting countries of having the ministry of finance (in our case, the Treasury Department) set the inflation target.",2001-07-17
Choosing a Specific Price Index Most broad measures of inflation move roughly in concert over time.,2001-07-17
"Nevertheless, the differentials among the most widely used aggregate measures of inflation generally are not stable over long periods.",2001-07-17
All inflation-targeting central banks use a measure of consumer price inflation for their target.,2001-07-17
"In the absence of a complete model of the cost of inflation to guide the choice, the use of consumer price measures seems appropriate because these measures are the most relevant to the calculation of real income for households, because the welfare of households is ultimately the goal for monetary policy, and because measures of consumer price inflation are often the most visible of inflation measures.",2001-07-17
"In the United States, this would mean a choice between the consumer price index (CPI) and the price index for personal consumption expenditures.",2001-07-17
"The CPI is the most widely recognized measure of consumer price inflation, but the Federal Reserve has expressed the view that the measure based on personal consumption expenditures has advantages as a measure of trends in consumer price inflation.",2001-07-17
Setting the inflation rate in terms of the price index for personal consumption expenditures would further elevate this measure in the public consciousness.,2001-07-17
"A related decision is whether to set the target in terms of overall inflation or in terms of core inflation--that is, consumer price inflation net of the direct influence of movements in energy and food prices, which tend to be volatile.",2001-07-17
"Focusing on core inflation might increase the likelihood that monetary policy would respond to underlying inflation developments that promised to be persistent, and not on transitory changes in inflation.",2001-07-17
"Nevertheless, most inflation-targeting regimes set their explicit inflation target in terms of overall inflation.",2001-07-17
"As long as policy is focused on achieving a longer-run inflation outcome, as opposed to meeting the target each quarter or even each year, a target for overall inflation can work well, because swings in energy and food prices that lead to shorter-run inflation blips tend to dissipate or wash out over longer periods.",2001-07-17
"In this case, it would also be useful, as is the practice at some inflation-targeting central banks, to monitor movements in core inflation as a guide to whether current monetary policy is well aligned with the longer-term objective for overall inflation.",2001-07-17
"Weighing the pros and cons, policy might be better and the communication to the public might be most clear if the target itself was expressed in terms of the core inflation rate.",2001-07-17
"Point or Range Practice differs among inflation-targeting central banks, with about half setting their targets as points and the other half as ranges.",2001-07-17
This provides a more precise anchor for inflation expectations and a more specific target for monetary policymakers.,2001-07-17
"If a range is selected, questions will arise about the differing implications of movements of inflation inside the range and outside the range and, in the absence of explicitly identifying the mid-point as the target, about where within the range policymakers would prefer inflation to gravitate.",2001-07-17
"If there is indifference about movements inside the range, this will tilt policy toward allowing greater variability of inflation.",2001-07-17
"If the objective is price stability, this may seem like a pointless question.",2001-07-17
"First, assuming that the official indexes are biased upward, true price stability will be achieved at some positive rate for measured inflation.",2001-07-17
"Second, there are considerations that favor allowing some small positive rate of true inflation, rather than true price stability.",2001-07-17
There are a couple of reasons to consider setting an inflation target above the level consistent with true price stability.,2001-07-17
"If there is resistance to declines in nominal wages, a small amount of wage inflation may enhance the flexibility of real wages and facilitate the movement to equilibrium in the labor market.15 Whether this requires positive price inflation will depend on the variance of the wage changes, the degree of nominal wage rigidity, and the rate of growth of labor productivity.",2001-07-17
"In addition, a positive rate of inflation increases the flexibility of monetary policy by allowing policymakers to drive real interest rates below zero.",2001-07-17
"Particularly in light of the latter consideration, I would set the inflation target at what I refer to as true price stability plus a small cushion.",2001-07-17
"Specifically, for the CPI, I would set it at 2 percent, 1 percentage point for the measurement error and 1 percentage point for the cushion.16 This would correspond roughly to a 1-1/2 percent inflation rate for the price index for personal consumption expenditures, based on recent differentials of this measure relative to the inflation rate for the CPI.",2001-07-17
Time Horizon There should be no fixed time horizon for returning inflation to its target when deviations occur.,2001-07-17
"On the other hand, it would be useful to use a measure for inflation that smoothes over transient shocks and that is not subject to potential problems with seasonal adjustment.",2001-07-17
"For that reason, I would favor a year-over-year measure of the inflation rate--for example, a twelve-month CPI or price index for personal consumption expenditures--for evaluating performance relative to the target.",2001-07-17
V. Conclusion It is widely agreed that price stability is an important objective of monetary policy and that central banks should be held responsible for that objective.,2001-07-17
"That said, central banks differ over whether they should set an explicit inflation target and whether they should acknowledge and take responsibility for other objectives, specifically full employment or output stabilization.",2001-07-17
An explicit inflation target would give added precision to an already mandated objective and would thereby improve the transparency of and accountability for monetary policy.,2001-07-17
"Moving to an explicit inflation target would, in my view, be consistent with the current statute governing the objectives of monetary policy in the United States and would, in turn, require no fundamental change in the current Federal Reserve strategy for implementing monetary policy.",2001-07-17
"In my view, if the explicit mandate is set in the context of a reaffirmation of the dual mandate, the flexibility now enjoyed by U.S. monetary policy will likely be maintained.",2001-07-17
A second question is whether moving in this direction would matter much for the conduct of monetary policy in the United States.,2001-07-17
"For a discussion of the case for price stability, see Fischer (1996).",2001-07-17
"These exercises therefore demonstrate the ability of simple rules--and by extension, discretionary monetary policy more broadly--to both reduce the variability of output and achieve a long-run inflation target.",2001-07-17
"Levin, Volker and Williams (1999) analyze the output-inflation volatility frontier in four different macroeconomic models.",2001-07-17
A Taylor rule could also be consistent with a regime that set inflation as the sole objective.,2001-07-17
"In this case, the output gap terms would be viewed as a predictor of inflation, allowing policymakers to take pre-emptive action to contain the threat of higher inflation, in addition to directly responding to higher inflation itself.",2001-07-17
This threshold is often referred to as the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment or the NAIRU.,2001-07-17
See Fuhrer and Sniderman (2000) for a series of papers on the implications of a zero nominal bound for the nominal interest rate for setting inflation targets.,2001-07-17
"They conclude: ""[I]n very low inflation environments…the zero bound could prove to be a significant constraint on policy…With the effectiveness of open market operations diminished at times, the economy would likely experience a noticeable increase in the variability of output and employment, particularly if policymakers were to pursue an inflation target of 1 percent or below.""",2001-07-17

"In fact, in terms of sheer volume, the expansion of financial activity has greatly outstripped economic growth in recent years.",2005-05-27
Many observers believe that this result has been a key factor in the strong productivity and growth that the United States has realized in recent years.,2005-05-27
"A particular phenomenon that touches on all these issues is the movement of asset prices, especially the prices of equities and residential real estate.",2005-05-27
"Because these assets are the most widely held by the general public, price changes, even when not exceptional, can significantly affect the macroeconomy.",2005-05-27
"Rising asset prices support household consumption, whereas falling asset prices damp consumption.",2005-05-27
"Apart from such outcomes, policymakers might also take special interest in asset price movements because it has been alleged that badly designed or poorly implemented policy (even if well intended) sometimes has helped feed unsustainable movements in asset prices.",2005-05-27
"Accordingly, I would like to highlight some aspects of the link between monetary conditions and asset prices and point to areas in which the policy community could use further insight from researchers, including perhaps from this distinguished group.",2005-05-27
Interaction of Asset Prices and Policy Asset price movements that are discontinuous or extreme can affect the policy process in at least two important ways.,2005-05-27
"First, because they are interest-sensitive, asset prices are primary components of the channels by which monetary policy is transmitted to the real economy.",2005-05-27
"Second, because asset prices are forward-looking, they should contain information of value for the policy-setting process.",2005-05-27
"By virtue of its mandate, the Federal Reserve focuses on price stability, interpreted to mean stability of consumer prices.",2005-05-27
"Monetary policy does not aim at any particular relative price, nor is the mandate thought to refer to prices beyond consumer prices, such as those for assets.",2005-05-27
"Ordinarily, however, asset prices are among the many factors that central bankers assess when we evaluate present economic and financial conditions and the outlook.",2005-05-27
"And when asset prices exhibit large, systematic, and persistent deviations from fundamentals, the implications of those deviations inevitably get more prominence.",2005-05-27
Clearly central bankers would benefit from a better understanding of asset price movements--particularly more extreme movements--so that we do not mistakenly facilitate in some way potentially harmful outcomes.,2005-05-27
"Liquidity and Asset Prices Overly rapid monetary expansion, or excessive liquidity, has been named as a leading suspect in some episodes of unsustainable movements in asset prices.",2005-05-27
"Liquidity could be measured narrowly as central bank money, for example, or more broadly to reflect the multiplier effects of the financial system; sometimes it is measured instead by the level of policy interest rates.",2005-05-27
All these definitions and others have been in play in the economics profession's analysis of the link between monetary conditions and asset prices.,2005-05-27
"Some commentators have taken a circular approach: If monetary conditions were comparatively easy when asset prices experienced a significant swing, then liquidity must have been ""excessive.""",2005-05-27
"The results of research at the Board and that of many others seeking to document a link between liquidity and swings in asset prices has focused on growth rates of broad monetary aggregates and measures of equity and house prices deflated by the price index for personal consumption expenditures.1 Using these measures, the results differ significantly according to the type of asset being studied.",2005-05-27
"For equity prices, under various alternative specifications, the link between the growth rate of liquidity and changes in real equity prices at frequencies beyond very short term appears to be tenuous at best.2 To illustrate, the upper panel of figure 1 shows a scatter plot of contemporaneous four-quarter growth rates of M3 and changes in broad measures of equity prices for sixteen industrial countries during roughly the past twenty-five years.3 As you can see, no obvious sign of a meaningful correlation at this frequency is evident in this pattern.",2005-05-27
"Most other studies--such as the study by Bordo and Wheelock--using a variety of definitions and more-rigorous techniques, support the same conclusion.4 The lack of a strong finding of any positive medium- to longer-run relationship, of course, could be because equity prices are quite volatile, making unconditional correlation difficult to identify.",2005-05-27
"Perhaps, too, more-refined measures of liquidity than those used in studies so far are needed to capture possible effects on equity prices.",2005-05-27
"So the effect of money growth on real equity prices is by no means a closed question, and there certainly would be interest in whatever might come from further research on this topic.",2005-05-27
"In contrast, the link between monetary growth, as measured by M3, and changes in real house prices appears to be more definite.",2005-05-27
"The bottom panel of figure 1 shows a similar scatter plot for the same group of countries and periods as in the upper panel, but for changes in real house prices.",2005-05-27
(I might add that the correlation with real house prices also holds even if M3 is normalized by prices or gross domestic product.,2005-05-27
"Negative correlation between interest rates and house prices is, of course, not unexpected.)",2005-05-27
"To explore this relationship further, figure 2 provides some background on longer-term movements in house prices in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan--three countries where house price movements have been prominent.5 As the three panels show, each country's movements in real house prices have experienced two or three cycles during the past thirty-five years, usually with relatively long periods of gains followed by long periods of decline.",2005-05-27
This suggests that one potentially useful way to explore further the relationship between liquidity and asset prices is to examine movements in those two variables in ten-year windows surrounding house price peaks.,2005-05-27
"The solid line in figure 3 shows the average behavior of the growth rate of M3 from twenty quarters before a peak in real house prices until twenty quarters after the peak, where the average is taken across all the cyclical episodes in our broad sample.",2005-05-27
The broken line in the chart is the log level of real house prices indexed to zero in the peak year.,2005-05-27
"As can be seen from the chart, on average the growth rate of money increases fairly steadily until around two quarters before the peak in real house prices and then drops fairly steadily for ten quarters afterward before recovering somewhat.",2005-05-27
"Although there are some variations, this pattern tends to occur in most countries' episodes.6 Importantly, the connection between money growth and house prices does not seem to vary much with the rate of macroeconomic expansion.",2005-05-27
"This statement is underlined by figure 4, which shows as an example actual house prices for the United Kingdom (the broken line) and their forecasted values from an equation based on the growth rate of real broad money and real long-term interest rates over more than twenty years (the solid line).",2005-05-27
Confirming that variations in growth rates of liquidity (especially unusual changes in liquidity growth that could be called excessive) systematically lead to wide swings in real asset prices requires further theoretical investigation and more empirical support.,2005-05-27
"That asset prices rise during a period of monetary easing is not surprising, of course.",2005-05-27
"But why growth of money sometimes might cause housing prices to move more than other asset prices or, for that matter, than goods prices is not clear.",2005-05-27
"For instance, as the value of collateral rises during a house price boom, the associated expansion of credit typically leads to increases in broad money.",2005-05-27
The effect can be accentuated by the temporary parking in liquid accounts of the proceeds from the more-frequent turnover and refinancings that often accompany a house price boom.,2005-05-27
"Complicating the analysis further, a substantial list of third factors could drive both housing prices and liquidity measures, producing co-movements that look like causality.",2005-05-27
"A productivity shock or a sharp decrease in energy prices, for example, could lead to general economic expansion and rising asset prices while goods prices are not rising.",2005-05-27
Distinguishing the various forces in play obviously requires tools that are finer than simple observations that both liquidity measures and assets prices are moving together.,2005-05-27
Identification of Unsustainable Movements The example cited above also should remind us that not all situations in which asset prices are rising rapidly under seemingly easy monetary conditions are worrisome.,2005-05-27
"When asset prices are moving in an unusual manner, is the movement unsustainable; does the pattern arise from excessive liquidity in the market; and will policy be challenged by that combination at some future date?",2005-05-27
"The answers to these questions depend in part on the link between an asset's price and some estimate of its ""fundamental"" value.",2005-05-27
"Unfortunately, from the point of view of both the analyst and the policymaker, the link between an asset's price and the structure of its return is hard to pin down, as it typically embodies complex factors that are inherently difficult to measure, such as expected future earnings, riskiness, and risk aversion.",2005-05-27
"Consequently, for evaluating in real time whether prices may be ""off track"" and, if so, by how much, we have to fall back on more readily observable measures that, in principle at least, should bear some systematic relationship to ideal measures and that can be assessed against historical experience.",2005-05-27
"For equities, a stock's price-earnings ratio is a standard benchmark for assessing valuation.",2005-05-27
"In the late 1990s, the price-earnings ratio for U.S. equities--especially in the high-tech area--soared to record levels, and the so-called equity risk premium narrowed to a historical low.",2005-05-27
"There was a strong sense at the time that such elevated price levels were unusual, but there was no uniform consensus regarding whether or not they were sustainable.",2005-05-27
"And even after we have seen a major correction, our understanding of what drove that process and what the proper level should have been--and should be now--still is unsettled.7 For housing, rent-to-price ratios and income-to-price ratios are commonly used measures to assess valuation.",2005-05-27
"In 2004, U.S. home prices increased 11.2 percent, their fastest pace since 1979, and right now, housing prices in many markets in the United States are relatively high when judged by conventional valuation measures.8 To know if housing is fairly valued requires assessing whether today's valuations are consistent with unobservable future rents, interest rates, and returns--concepts for which we have only rough proxies.",2005-05-27
"However, in some markets the most prudent judgment is that the growth of house prices will slow from the rapid pace experienced most recently.",2005-05-27
"Some patterns of asset price changes that are attributed to excess liquidity may arise, for example, from financial innovation and other structural changes.9 But mapping such changes into asset price movements to control for such factors is difficult.",2005-05-27
"For example, the rise in house prices in the United Kingdom in the late 1980s was thought at the time to relate importantly to the liberalization of U.K. banking laws several years earlier and, therefore, likely to be sustainable.",2005-05-27
The inability to more accurately gauge the effects on asset prices conferred (or not) by earlier structural changes likely contributed to the inaccurate expectation that they would last longer.,2005-05-27
"In Sweden, the large and swift increases in property prices in the 1980s also related in part to the earlier liberalization of domestic banking laws and consequent easier lending practices.",2005-05-27

"I am honored to deliver the inaugural Mike McCracken Lecture on Full Employment.1 Widely known for his critical contributions in bringing computer modeling to Canadian economic forecasting, Mike McCracken is perhaps best known for his tireless advocacy that ""lower unemployment remains the most important goal for the economy,"" which is particularly resonant for me, along with his emphasis on thinking critically and expansively about full employment.2 A similar theme was highlighted by community and labor representatives as well as educators at our Fed Listens events, and it is now reflected in the Federal Reserve's new monetary policy framework.3 Lifting the lives of working people is at the heart of economic policymaking.",2021-01-13
"The deep and disparate damage caused by the pandemic, coming just over a decade after the financial crisis, underscores the vital importance of full employment, particularly for low- and moderate-income workers and those facing systemic challenges in the labor market.",2021-01-13
"Monetary Policy Framework Two years ago, the Federal Reserve began an in-depth review of its monetary policy framework.4 The design of our review process incorporated features from the Bank of Canada's quinquennial renewal of its inflation-control framework agreement, such as input from stakeholders and the focused research undertaken by staff members, academics, and outside experts.",2021-01-13
"Our review was prompted by changes in key long-run features of the economy: The recognition that price inflation is much less sensitive to labor market tightness than historicallyâ€”that is, a flat Phillips curve; that the equilibrium interest rate is much lower than in the past; and that trend underlying inflation has moved somewhat below 2 percent.",2021-01-13
"These developments reduce the amount we can cut interest rates to buffer the economy, weaken inflation expectations, and could lead to worse employment and inflation outcomes over time if not addressed.",2021-01-13
"In response, we have made changes to monetary policy that can be expected to support fuller and broader-based employment than in earlier recoveries, improving opportunities for workers who have faced structural challenges in the labor market.5 Whereas our previous strategy had been to minimize deviations from maximum employment in either direction, monetary policy will now seek to eliminate shortfalls from maximum employment.",2021-01-13
"In other words, the new framework calls for policy to address employment when it falls short of its maximum level, whereas the previous framework called for policy to react when employment was judged to be too high as well as too low.",2021-01-13
The new monetary policy framework also eliminates the previous reference to a numerical estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate and instead defines the maximum level of employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal for which a wide range of indicators are relevant.,2021-01-13
Additional changes address the persistence of below-target inflation and the decline in the equilibrium interest rate.,2021-01-13
"Research and experience indicate that persistent low equilibrium interest rates increase the frequency and duration of periods when the policy rate is pinned close to zero, unemployment is elevated, and inflation is below target.6 As a result, actual inflation and inflation expectations will tend to be biased below the 2 percent target, further eroding policy space and exacerbating the effects of the lower bound, risking a downward spiral for actual and expected inflation.",2021-01-13
"From the time of the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) announcement of a 2 percent inflation objective in January 2012 through the most recent data in November, monthly readings of 12-month personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation have averaged 1.4 percent and have been below 2 percent in 95 out of the 107 months.",2021-01-13
"To address the downward bias, the new framework adopts a flexible average inflation-targeting strategy (FAIT) that seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time in order to ensure longer-term inflation expectations are well anchored at 2 percent.",2021-01-13
"Under a FAIT strategy, appropriate monetary policy aims to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time to make up for shortfalls during a period when it has been running persistently below 2 percent.7 These changes could have a beneficial effect on the robustness of employment as well as the economy's potential growth rate.",2021-01-13
"In current circumstances, where a strong labor market can be sustained without the emergence of high inflation, the conventional practice of reducing policy accommodation preemptively when unemployment nears its estimated longer-run normal rate is likely to lead to an unwarranted loss of opportunity for many workers.8 For instance, the labor market healing that took place after the unemployment rate reached the 5 percent median Summary of Economic Projections estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate, from the fourth quarter of 2015 until the fourth quarter of 2019, included the entry of a further 3-1/2 million prime-age Americans into the labor force, a movement of nearly 1 million people out of long-term unemployment, and opportunities for 2 million involuntary part-time workers to secure full-time jobs.9 The gains in employment may have come sooner and been greater if the new monetary policy framework had been in place throughout the previous recovery.",2021-01-13
"This could, in turn, boost activity and increase potential growth by drawing individuals from groups facing structural challenges into more productive employment.10 Research and experience suggest the groups that face the greatest structural challenges in the labor market are likely to be the first to experience layoffs during downturns and the last to experience employment gains during recoveries.11 At the October 2019 Fed Listens event, Amanda Cage, who now heads the National Fund for Workforce Solutions, observed, ""What we see is huge disparities in what unemployment looks like for neighborhoods.",2021-01-13
"""12 She highlighted the challenges facing those communities where unemployment remains at or above 15 percent even when unemployment falls below 4 percent at the national level.",2021-01-13
"Recent research indicates that additional labor market tightening is especially beneficial to disadvantaged groups when it occurs in already tight labor markets, compared with earlier in the labor market cycle.13 For example, the gap between the Black and White unemployment rates fell to an all-time low of 2 percentage points in August 2019â€”well below its average of 6.3 percentage points.14 Outlook and Policy Late last year, the Committee integrated the framework changes into its monetary policy.",2021-01-13
"The September 2020 FOMC statement adopted outcome-based forward guidance for the policy rate tied to shortfalls from maximum employment and 2 percent average inflation, and the December 2020 FOMC statement adopted outcome-based forward guidance for asset purchases.",2021-01-13
"Our monetary policy approach should support a stronger, broader-based recovery from the deep and disparate damage of COVID-19.",2021-01-13
"The guidance indicates that the Committee expects the policy rate to remain at the lower bound until employment has reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.",2021-01-13
"The forward guidance reflects the important lesson that, with a significantly smaller scope to cut the policy rate than in past recessions, the Committee can provide needed accommodation by making forward commitments on the policy rate that are credible to the public.15 The outcome-based forward guidance communicates how the policy rate will react to the evolution of inflation and employment.",2021-01-13
It makes clear that the timing of liftoff will depend on realized progress toward maximum employment and 2 percent average inflation.,2021-01-13
"The FOMC statement notes that monetary policy will remain accommodative after liftoff in order to achieve ""inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time.",2021-01-13
"""16 Even after economic conditions warrant liftoff, changes in the policy rate are likely to be only gradual to support the inflation makeup strategy and maximum employment.",2021-01-13
"The Survey of Market Participants conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates a shift in expectations following the release of the new monetary policy framework.17 The median expected rate of unemployment at the time of liftoff moved down from 4.5 percent in the July survey, before the release of the framework, to 4.0 percent in the September and subsequent surveys, following the release of the new framework.",2021-01-13
"Similarly, the median level of 12-month PCE inflation anticipated at the time of liftoff rose from 2 percent in the July survey to 2.3 percent in the September survey and beyond, following the introduction of FAIT.18 The forward guidance adopted in December expands the goals of the asset purchases beyond market functioning by establishing qualitative outcome-based criteria tied to realized progress on our employment and inflation goals.",2021-01-13
The December guidance clarifies that the pandemic asset purchases will continue at least at the current pace until substantial further progress is made on our employment and inflation goals.,2021-01-13
"In assessing substantial further progress, I will be looking for sustained improvements in realized and expected inflation and will examine a range of indicators to assess shortfalls from maximum employment.",2021-01-13
"Additionally, state and local income and sales tax and gaming and energy-related revenues remain depressed, and the most recent payrolls report indicates that state and local governments are having difficulty sustaining employment levels as the virus persists.",2021-01-13
Inflation remains very low; core PCE inflation ran at 1.4 percent over the 12 months ending in November.,2021-01-13
"Even though some of the survey-based measures of inflation expectations have picked up recently, they still remain close to the lower end of their historical ranges.",2021-01-13
Market-based measures of inflation compensation have also picked up.,2021-01-13
"While disentangling inflation expectations from liquidity and term premiums is imprecise, staff models attribute a significant portion of the movement in inflation compensation to an increase in expectations, bringing them up from the lows seen in March but still below their historical averages.",2021-01-13
"Inflation may temporarily rise to or above 2 percent on a 12-month basis in a few months when the low March and April price readings from last year fall out of the 12-month calculation, but it will be important to see sustained improvement to meet our average inflation goal.",2021-01-13
"The COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating disparities, and employment remains far from our goals.",2021-01-13
"Overall, payroll employment is still nearly 10 million jobs below its February level.",2021-01-13
"If we adjust the 6.7 percent headline unemployment rate for the decline in participation since February and the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimate of misclassification, the unemployment rate would be 10 percent, similar to the peak following the Global Financial Crisis.",2021-01-13
"Federal Reserve staff analysis indicates that unemployment is likely above 20 percent for workers in the bottom wage quartile, while it has fallen below 5 percent for the top wage quartile.20 Black and Hispanic unemployment stood at 9.9 percent and 9.3 percent, respectively, in December, while White unemployment was 6.0 percent.",2021-01-13
"Fortunately, fiscal support looks set to resume playing a vital role in the form of stimulus payments and extended unemployment benefits, particularly for the cash-constrained households that make up a significant fraction of the population.",2021-01-13
The unprecedented scale and composition of fiscal support made a vital difference in replacing lost income and supporting demand in the middle of last year and is expected to do so again in the months ahead.,2021-01-13
The unprecedented speed and breadth of the monetary policy response through an expanded set of tools is supporting lower borrowing costs along the yield curve for households and businesses as well as better inflation and employment outcomes.,2021-01-13
We are strongly committed to achieving our maximum-employment and average-inflation goals.,2021-01-13
"The economy is far away from our goals in terms of both employment and inflation, and even under an optimistic outlook, it will take time to achieve substantial further progress.",2021-01-13
"We remain far from our goals, with core PCE inflation only at 1.4 percent and payroll employment nearly 10 million below its pre-pandemic level.",2021-01-13
"The Committee's forward guidance will help keep borrowing costs low along the yield curve for households and businesses, improve inflation outcomes, and enable the labor market to heal, leading to a broader-based and stronger recovery.",2021-01-13
"The strong support from monetary policy, together with fiscal stimulus, should turn the K-shaped recovery into a broad-based and inclusive recovery that delivers full employment, as Mike McCracken would have wished.",2021-01-13
"My plan is to address some topical and important issues, some of which are quite technical but technicalities that I think can have significant consequences.1 After providing my thoughts on where the economy and monetary policy are now, I will turn to what we can expect from monetary policy in the years to come.",2020-02-06
"Changes in the economic environment since the financial crisis, including an apparent decline in the equilibrium interest rate, have complicated the conduct of monetary policy as we work to achieve our dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices.",2020-02-06
"The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is currently undertaking a review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices to make sure we are best positioned to confront the challenges ahead.",2020-02-06
"Instead, I would like to address a separate but not unrelated topic, the interaction of bank supervision and regulation with monetary policy, and how supervision and regulation might work to make monetary policy implementation more effective in the current environment, particularly as it relates to a bank's demand for reserves.2 But first, let me start with a brief take on the current economic outlook.",2020-02-06
The unemployment rate is at a 50-year low.,2020-02-06
"Taken together, low unemployment and steady participation have boosted the employment-to-population ratio, which has finally surpassed its pre-crisis level.",2020-02-06
"A strong labor market, in turn, supports a healthy pace of consumption growth and the economy more generally.",2020-02-06
"Increasing the capital stock and investing in new technologies are important for productivity growth, rising living standards, and the economy's long-run growth rate, so reversing the recent downward trend is essential for the overall health of the economy.",2020-02-06
"In part, the fall in investment likely reflects business concerns over the pace of global growth and risks to the outlook.",2020-02-06
"In particular, 2019 was a bad year for economic growth among U.S. trading partners, and, as a consequence, our exports suffered.",2020-02-06
"In summary, I remain optimistic about the outlook, but I am also highly aware that some notable risks still threaten growth, both overseas and at home.",2020-02-06
A few words on inflation.,2020-02-06
"Both headline and core inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, came in at 1.6 percent in December, somewhat below the FOMC's 2 percent objective.",2020-02-06
"This deviation does not worry me that much, in part because I expect inflation to move back to target over the medium term, in part as some unusually low readings in early 2019 pass out of the data.",2020-02-06
"Already, various trimmed price indexes are running much closer to 2 percent.",2020-02-06
Monetary Policy Considerations I view the current stance of monetary policy as appropriate given the economic outlook and relatively muted inflation pressures.,2020-02-06
"Policy is in a good place to support continued economic growth, strong labor market conditions, and inflation returning to target.",2020-02-06
"That said, now is a good time to be thinking about the challenges that monetary policy is likely to face in the coming years.",2020-02-06
"One important development, as I mentioned at the start, is that interest rates at home and abroad have declined significantly from their pre-recession levels.",2020-02-06
"Policymakers, economists, and market participants see much of this decline as reflecting a permanent fall in the equilibrium rate of interestâ€”that is, the level of the federal funds rate that keeps the economy at full employment with stable inflation in the longer run.",2020-02-06
"One such tool is forward guidance: By credibly conveying to the public that policymakers will likely pursue a path for the policy rate that is lower than previously anticipated, policymakers can put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates.",2020-02-06
The increased scarcity tends to raise the price of these securities and depress their yields.,2020-02-06
"Some observers argue that forward guidance and asset purchases fully offset the shortfall in policy accommodation caused by a lack of space to cut interest rates further, so that the limits on the Fed's policy rate did not ultimately constrain our policy response to the financial crisis.",2020-02-06
"In particular, inflation remained contained, and longer-run inflation expectations did not become unanchored.",2020-02-06
"To gain the full benefit of our toolkit, it will be important to continue to communicate clearly about our willingness to use all of our tools in future downturns.6 The greater the public confidence that policymakers will use these tools in response to episodes when the ability to cut the policy rate is constrained, the more real longer-term interest rates will systematically decline in response to negative economic developments, providing an automatic stabilizer to the economy.",2020-02-06
"Moreover, public confidence in the FOMC's ability to react to economic downturnsâ€”even when the policy rate is very lowâ€”will support the resilience of longer-term inflation expectations at levels consistent with the FOMC's objective.",2020-02-06
Keeping inflation expectations anchored will in turn further support the FOMC's ability to lower real interest rates if the economy were to weaken substantially.,2020-02-06
"Balance Sheet Policies and Reserve Demand Taking stock, I note that one approach to the constraints on policy imposed by the current low level of interest rates is to make what were previously unconventional toolsâ€”balance sheet policies and forward guidanceâ€”as conventional as possible.",2020-02-06
"As the FOMC announced in January of 2019, the Committee intends to implement monetary policy in an ample-reserves regime.7 With that approach, control over the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve's administered rates and is not, over the longer term, reliant on frequent and large open market operations.",2020-02-06
The Committee also reiterated that it would assess the level of reserves most consistent with efficient and effective monetary policy implementation.,2020-02-06
"I will spend the remainder of my time exploring possible means to enhance the efficiency of our monetary policy implementation, including reserve provision, through adjustments to our existing regulatory and supervisory regime.",2020-02-06
"In particular, I will focus on liquidity regulation and supervision as well as interactions with monetary policy tools.",2020-02-06
"Such an approach could improve the efficiency of monetary policy implementation, as firms might show a greater willingness to reallocate to Treasury securities, reducing reserve demand and improving market functioning.",2020-02-06
The Federal Reserve is justly proud of its success in reducing and stabilizing inflation in the United States.,2005-02-11
"When Paul Volcker became Fed chairman twenty-five years ago, Americans were enduring double-digit inflation rates and subpar economic performance.",2005-02-11
"Under the leadership of Volcker and, subsequently, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Open Market Committee took the actions necessary to bring the nation to price stability.",2005-02-11
"In my view, the conquest of inflation has been a major source of the more-rapid economic growth and the greater stability of output and employment that the United States has enjoyed since the mid-1980s (Bernanke, 2004).",2005-02-11
"Impressive as the Fed's inflation-fighting accomplishments may be, however, inflation developments to our south, in Latin America, may prove to be more impressive yet.",2005-02-11
"For much of the latter half of the twentieth century, Latin America experienced recurrent bouts of high inflation together with erratic growth and periods of economic and financial crisis.",2005-02-11
"Since the mid-1990s, however, inflation rates in virtually all of Latin America have come down dramatically, to the single digits in most cases.",2005-02-11
"Will Latin American progress on inflation be sustained, or is the recent improvement only a temporary lull?",2005-02-11
"In my remarks today I will offer some tentative answers to these questions, noting as always that the views I will express are not necessarily shared by my colleagues at the Federal Reserve.1 The Roots of Latin American Inflation For those of us here in the United States, acclimated as we have become to price stability, the severity of inflation in many Latin American countries in recent decades may be difficult to comprehend.",2005-02-11
"A measure of price changes in nine of the most populous Latin American countries shows that inflation in the region averaged nearly 160 percent per year in the 1980s and 235 percent per year in the first half of the 1990s.2 Indeed, high inflation morphed into hyperinflation--conventionally defined as inflation exceeding 50 percent per month (Cagan, 1956)--in a number of Latin countries during the latter part of the 1980s and in the early 1990s.",2005-02-11
"Brazil's inflation rate, for example, exceeded 1,000 percent per year in four of the five years between 1989 and 1993.",2005-02-11
"Other Latin American countries suffering hyperinflations at about that time included Argentina, Bolivia, Nicaragua, and Peru.",2005-02-11
A particularly striking aspect of this poor inflation performance is that it occurred while most of the rest of the world was reducing inflation to low levels.,2005-02-11
"Inflation in the region began to moderate in the mid-1990s, however.",2005-02-11
"Inflation in nine major countries--which, as already noted, averaged nearly 235 percent per year in the first half of the 1990s--averaged only 13 percent per year in 1995-99 and less than 8 percent in 2000-04 despite the spike in Argentine inflation that followed that country's crisis in 2002.3 Why was inflation a perennial problem in Latin America until about ten years ago, and what explains the recent improvement?",2005-02-11
"Fundamentally, in my view, inflation trends are driven by ideas and politics, which in turn influence economic institutions and economic policies.",2005-02-11
"In the realm of ideas, the current consensus among economists--that money growth generated by fiscal deficits is the driving force behind virtually all episodes of very high inflation--has not always held sway in the region.4 For example, during the 1950s and 1960s, the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC), under the direction of Raul Prebisch, promoted so-called structuralist theories of development.",2005-02-11
"The outsized role of the government in the economies that pursued the import substitution strategy, together with relatively narrow tax bases and inefficient tax collection, led to chronic fiscal deficits and pervasive economic inefficiency in the protected industries.",2005-02-11
"Importantly, structuralism placed little weight on monetary factors in explaining inflation.",2005-02-11
"Proponents of this approach viewed price increases as being determined largely on the real side of the economy--for example, by spot shortages arising from uneven patterns of development and by the efforts of labor and other groups to increase their shares of aggregate income.",2005-02-11
"From the structuralist perspective, monetary policy makers have little option other than to accommodate wage and price increases, as these increases are determined outside the monetary sphere--a conclusion that rationalized central banks' abdication of responsibility for inflation.",2005-02-11
Structuralists also promoted extensive indexation of wages and contracts as a way of minimizing unintended distributional consequences of the unavoidable inflation.,2005-02-11
"Unfortunately, pervasive wage-price indexation only increased the virulence of inflationary cycles, as price increases were rapidly transmitted to wages and then back to prices.",2005-02-11
"Among the political sources of inflation, populist views exerted strong influence in many Latin American countries, supported by understandable public dissatisfaction over the degree of income inequality.",2005-02-11
These over-expansionary fiscal and monetary policies were generally followed in short order by wage and price controls and new rounds of subsidies as the overheating economy stoked inflation and inflation expectations and created bottlenecks and shortages.,2005-02-11
"Currency overvaluation, capital flight, declining real tax revenues, sharp increases in external debt, and accelerating inflation completed the downward spiral, which typically ended in general economic and political crisis.",2005-02-11
"Ironically, the poor often were among those most hurt by extreme populist policies because they were the most vulnerable to rising unemployment and real-wage declines and the least able to protect themselves against inflation.5 Latin America's macroeconomic problems reached their apogee during the so-called Lost Decade of the 1980s.",2005-02-11
Governments had run up large amounts of external debt in the 1970s in an attempt to maintain growth in the face of oil price shocks and macroeconomic mismanagement at home.,2005-02-11
"But in 1982, during a period of high real interest rates and slow growth around the globe, Mexico briefly defaulted on its debt, an event that marked the beginning of the debt crisis of the 1980s.",2005-02-11
"Currencies were sharply devalued as current accounts were forced to adjust, rising fiscal deficits were again financed by money creation, and inflation soon rose to new heights.",2005-02-11
"Several ""heterodox"" stabilization plans initiated in the mid-1980s, such as Argentina's Austral Plan and Brazil's Cruzado Plan, attempted to stabilize the currency and rein in inflation by using a fixed exchange rate as a nominal anchor.",2005-02-11
"As a fixed exchange rate (if successfully maintained) ties down the level of import prices, policymakers hoped that this approach would stabilize inflation and inflation expectations more generally.",2005-02-11
"Other features of heterodox plans included the scaling back of indexation provisions and, in some cases, the imposition of wage and price controls.",2005-02-11
"However, in most cases, the underlying fiscal problems were not addressed, resulting in the collapse of the stabilization plans and further acceleration of inflation.",2005-02-11
"Notwithstanding a sharp banking and balance-of-payments crisis early in the decade, inflation in Chile averaged less than 20 percent in the 1980s, compared with rates of about 350 percent in Argentina and 265 percent in Brazil.",2005-02-11
"The Achievement of Price Stability in the 1990s After so many years of failed stabilization attempts, an observer in 1990 might have been forgiven for concluding that low and stable inflation would remain elusive in Latin America.",2005-02-11
"But during the subsequent decade, better economic analysis and better policies led to far-better outcomes on the inflation front, as I have already noted.",2005-02-11
"The conquest of inflation in Latin America is a particularly interesting case study of the beneficial effects of the new thinking, although, as we shall see, success came only through persistent experimentation.",2005-02-11
"After the debacles of the late 1980s, the view that inflation--particularly very high inflation--carries significant economic costs became more widely accepted, supported by empirical analyses and accumulated experience (Khan and Senhadji, 2001).",2005-02-11
"In the early 1990s, consequently, many Latin American countries attacked their inflation problems with a new energy.",2005-02-11
"Initially, a common tactic was to fix the exchange rate, in the hope that an exchange-rate peg might stabilize inflation expectations and help to ""import"" some necessary monetary discipline.",2005-02-11
"The use of fixed exchange rates was reminiscent of the earlier heterodox programs, although in the more market-oriented programs of the 1990s, wage-price controls and similar restrictions were generally not employed.",2005-02-11
"For example, Mexico maintained a pegged exchange rate from 1987 through 1991, as part of a program that included a substantial reduction in government spending.",2005-02-11
"Inflation fell from 160 percent in 1987 to less than 20 percent in 1991, and growth picked up.",2005-02-11
"Brazil adopted a stabilization program in 1994, the Real Plan, which included aggressive de-indexation of wages and prices along with other structural reforms (Bogdanski, de Freitas, Goldfajn, and Tombini, 2002).",2005-02-11
"At first, the exchange rate was allowed to float.",2005-02-11
"However, after the Mexican crisis in late 1994, the Brazilians adopted a crawling-band regime, under which the exchange rate was devalued at a pre-determined rate.",2005-02-11
This regime was successful in ending the country's rapid inflation of the first half of the decade: Inflation in Brazil fell to less than 2 percent in 1998.,2005-02-11
The currency board helped Argentina enjoy price stability for more than a decade.,2005-02-11
"With the benefit of hindsight, many economists would now agree that exchange-rate pegs, if combined with other policy measures such as fiscal consolidation, can be useful in the transition from high to low inflation.6 However, a key lesson of the recent experience is that fixed exchange rates are generally not a long-run solution to problems of monetary and fiscal instability, at least not in a world of high capital mobility.",2005-02-11
"If not fixed exchange rates, then what?",2005-02-11
"Thus, the principal Latin American nations, forced to float their currencies, needed a new nominal anchor for monetary policy.",2005-02-11
"Following a growing trend in the industrialized world, a number of countries made the decision to adopt explicit, quantitative targets for inflation.7 As with many other reforms, Chile was the Latin American pioneer, adopting an inflation target in 1990 after the passage of a new central-banking law in 1989.",2005-02-11
"Like a number of other early adopters, particularly among emerging markets, Chile eased into the new approach by combining inflation targets with a reference band for the exchange rate.",2005-02-11
The exchange rate band did not disappear entirely until 1999.,2005-02-11
"The Central Bank of Chile's initial inflation target, for 1991, was the range between 15 and 20 percent; the actual outcome for that year was 18.7 percent.",2005-02-11
"Over the next decade, both the target and actual inflation came down gradually.",2005-02-11
"Following the 1994 peso crisis, Mexico, while setting a goal for inflation, adopted a dual monetary regime that focused primarily on money growth.",2005-02-11
"In the early years, the inflation target was almost always missed, perhaps because of the use of a framework with multiple objectives.",2005-02-11
"In 1999, Mexico instituted a formal inflation-targeting regime.",2005-02-11
"Since then, Mexican inflation, which had been declining from its recent peak of 52 percent in 1995, has fallen further, to around 5 percent.",2005-02-11
The central bank recently tightened policy to bring inflation down to its current target range of 2 to 4 percent.,2005-02-11
"Brazil also adopted inflation targeting in 1999, following the collapse of its crawling-peg exchange-rate regime in the months after the 1998 Russian debt crisis.",2005-02-11
"After a transition period that included monetary and fiscal tightening, President Cardoso issued a decree in June 1999 announcing multiyear inflation targets.",2005-02-11
"He assigned responsibility for setting the targets to the National Monetary Council and gave the central bank full responsibility for implementing monetary policy as needed to achieve the targets.8 The Brazilian Central Bank has taken this responsibility seriously; for example, it has tightened monetary policy several times since inflation moved above the target range last year.",2005-02-11
"Brazil also moved more quickly than other Latin American inflation targeters to adopt procedures to improve communication with the public, including the publication of an Inflation Report that includes the central bank's inflation forecasts (Mishkin, 2000).",2005-02-11
"Although Brazilian inflation rose temporarily following a capital outflow and a sharp depreciation of the real in 2002, inflation in that country has otherwise remained in the 6 to 8 percent range since the adoption of inflation targets.",2005-02-11
"Other Latin American countries that have turned to inflation targets include Colombia, which began using the approach in 1999, and Peru; the Central Bank of Peru has been announcing inflation target ranges since 1994, although it did not adopt a full-fledged inflation-targeting regime until 2002.",2005-02-11
"Argentina, which is still recovering from its 2002 debt crisis and the collapse of its currency board, has set unofficial target ranges for inflation.",2005-02-11
"First, in contrast to the structuralist past, the inflation-targeting approach recognizes the key role of the central bank's monetary policies in determining the inflation rate.",2005-02-11
No longer can the monetary authorities claim that inflation is not under their control.,2005-02-11
"Second, the accountability and transparency that are part of a mature inflation-targeting regime fit well, I believe, with the increasingly democratic nature of Latin American governments and the growing economic sophistication of the public.",2005-02-11
"Third, a well-designed inflation-targeting regime can help to stabilize and anchor the public's expectations of long-run inflation; well-anchored inflation expectations, in turn, promote macroeconomic stability and reduce the vulnerability of the domestic economy to exchange-rate fluctuations and other shocks.",2005-02-11
"Finally, inflation targeting and flexible exchange rates together serve to reduce the conflict between domestic economic stability and the free movement of capital across borders that is inherent in some other arrangements, most obviously the fixed-exchange-rate regimes favored by these countries in the past.",2005-02-11
How have inflation targets worked in Latin America?,2005-02-11
"Among the major inflation-targeting countries, the inflation rate has recently been in the range of 1 to 3 percent in Chile, 5 to 8 percent in Colombia, 4 to 6 percent in Mexico, 1 to 4 percent in Peru, and (as already noted) 6 to 8 percent in Brazil.",2005-02-11
"For example, inflation is typically more difficult to control in developing economies than in the industrialized economies because of the greater influence of exchange-rate fluctuations, the heavy weight of volatile food and commodity prices in the consumer basket, and the volatility of the public's inflation expectations resulting from a history of high and unstable inflation.",2005-02-11
"Emerging-market central banks that adopt inflation targeting must not only develop the forecasting and monetary-policy tools needed to meet their targets, they must also choose target ranges that are not so narrow as to be unachievable but narrow enough to allow monetary policymakers to build credibility (Fraga, Goldfajn, and Minella, 2003).",2005-02-11
"As the list of middle-income inflation targeters grows--outside of Latin America, it now includes, among others, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, South Korea, Thailand, South Africa, and Israel--and as more experience is gained, knowledge about how to best manage this approach in the emerging-market context will grow as well.",2005-02-11
"Underlying Causes of Improved Inflation Performance I do not mean to claim, however, that Latin America conquered inflation simply by choosing a particular framework for monetary policy.",2005-02-11
"Rather, my more fundamental point is that inflation has declined in Latin America because new ideas and new political realities have fostered the development of economic institutions and policies that promote macroeconomic stability more generally.",2005-02-11
"Recent changes in the policy environment have been especially important in three areas: fiscal policy, banking regulation, and central bank independence.9 No monetary-policy regime, including inflation targeting, will succeed in reducing inflation permanently in the face of unsustainable fiscal policies--large and growing deficits.",2005-02-11
"In light of their painful experiences, Latin American citizens certainly understand that unchecked deficits will eventually exhaust the government's capacity to borrow, leading to excess money creation and a breakout of inflation.",2005-02-11
"Throughout the region, lower inflation and greater fiscal discipline bear the promise of creating a virtuous circle, in which lower interest rates reduce the portion of government spending devoted to debt service.",2005-02-11
Domestic real interest rates have indeed moderated considerably and currently stand at 2-3 percent in Chile and Mexico and about zero in Argentina.,2005-02-11
"Brazil's real interest rate remains stubbornly high, at about 11 percent, but that rate is down from nearly 30 percent less than a decade ago.",2005-02-11
Modernization of the banking system and the improvement of bank regulation and supervision are likewise essential for promoting stable monetary policy and low inflation.,2005-02-11
"If the banking system is considered by foreign and domestic investors to be financially unstable or not transparent, then the fear of inducing a banking crisis may constrain the central bank's willingness to change interest rates and exchange rates as needed to fight inflation.",2005-02-11
"Financial-sector reforms in the region have included reducing or eliminating targeted credit programs, decontrolling interest rates, privatizing state-owned banks, and allowing foreign banks greater scope to operate in the domestic market, among other measures.",2005-02-11
"Inflation-targeting regimes make sense only if the central bank has independent control of the instruments of monetary policy, as holding the central bank responsible for meeting its inflation target is hardly possible otherwise.",2005-02-11
That central bank independence promotes lower inflation in developed countries is well-established by the economic literature.,2005-02-11
"Although the evidence for developing countries is more mixed, several studies have found that central bank independence promotes low inflation in those countries as well, especially when de facto rather than de jure measures of independence are used (Cukierman, Webb, and Neypati, 1992; Cukierman, Miller, and Neypati, 2002).",2005-02-11
"For example, although a number of features of Brazilian law promote the independence of the nation's central bank, the bank's de facto independence may be limited by the power of the president to remove members of the Monetary Policy Committee.",2005-02-11

Inflation in the broader region is estimated to have been about 6-1/2 percent on average in 2004 and is expected to be a bit lower than that in 2005 (annual average basis).,2005-02-11
"Notably, as I have discussed today, the inflation situation has improved markedly, and real interest rates have fallen.",2005-02-11

Mishkin (2000) distinguishes the setting of inflation targets from a full-fledged inflation-targeting regime.,2005-02-11
"The latter involves not only the announcement of a medium-term inflation target and an institutional commitment by the central bank and the government to meet that target but also an increased emphasis on independence, transparency, and accountability for the central bank.",2005-02-11

"Fixed exchange rates, also, are not necessarily a problem.",1997-12-02
But a small open economy can maintain an exchange rate fixed to a hard currency only under certain conditions.,1997-12-02
"Other economies, such as Argentina and Hong Kong, have fixed their exchange rates essentially through currency boards.",1997-12-02
"But when exchange rates are fixed, with or without currency boards, should monetary and fiscal policies diverge significantly from those of the larger economy, the currency lock of the smaller economy would be difficult to hold irrespective of the size of reserves.",1997-12-02

A well-functioning international financial system will seek out anomalies in policy alignments and exchange rates and set them right.,1997-12-02

"Clearly, however, faster growth in Japan and other major industrial countries would support a stronger, more balanced, and more durable recovery than one driven by U.S. growth alone.",2003-05-31
"In that spirit, my remarks today will be focused on opportunities for monetary policy innovation in Japan, including specifically the possibility of more-active monetary-fiscal cooperation to end deflation.",2003-05-31
"Indeed, all these elements are crucial if Japan's economy is to return to a more satisfactory rate of growth.",2003-05-31
"Indeed, a definitive end to the deflation in consumer prices--by restoring confidence and stimulating spending--would do much to help moderate the unemployment and financial distress that might otherwise arise as the results of aggressive programs of reform and restructuring.",2003-05-31
"Obviously, then, no inference should be made about those meetings from the comments to follow.1 Today I would like to consider three related issues that bear on contemporary monetary policy in Japan.",2003-05-31
"First, I will discuss the option of asking the Bank of Japan to announce a quantitative objective for prices, as well as how such an objective might best be structured.",2003-05-31
"Rather than proposing the more familiar inflation target, I will suggest that the BOJ consider adopting a price-level target, which would imply a period of reflation to offset the effects on prices of the recent period of deflation.",2003-05-31
What Objective for Japanese Monetary Policy?,2003-05-31
"In that spirit, a discussion of Japanese monetary policy should begin with some discussion of the policy objective.",2003-05-31
"The Bank of Japan Law, passed in 1998, sets price stability as a primary objective for the central bank.",2003-05-31
"As with our own Federal Reserve Act, price stability is not, however, precisely defined in the Law.",2003-05-31
"Currently, the BOJ has promised that the zero-interest-rate policy will be maintained until deflation is brought to an end, a policy that might be deemed consistent with the price stability objective.",2003-05-31
"First, the BOJ's statement seems to imply that the current level of policy stimulus might start to be withdrawn as soon as measured inflation returns to zero; in particular, no explicit commitment has been made to maintain inflation at zero, much less at some positive rate, in the longer run.",2003-05-31
But the presence of measurement bias in Japanese price indexes suggest that a measured inflation rate of at least one percent is likely required in order to achieve true price stability in the long run.,2003-05-31
"Moreover, inflation above zero will be needed if real interest rates in Japan are to be negative for a period, as many observers think is necessary for full recovery.",2003-05-31
"Second, over the past five years, since the onset of the current deflationary episode--and, incidentally, since the passage of the new Bank of Japan Law--the price level has trended down, registering a cumulative decline (depending on the price index) of between 4 and 9 percent.",2003-05-31
"One might argue that the legal objective of price stability should require not only a commitment to stabilize prices in the future but also a policy of actively reflating the economy, in order to restore the price level that prevailed prior to the prolonged period of deflation.",2003-05-31
"As you may know, I have advocated explicit inflation targets, or at least a quantitative definition of price stability, for other leading central banks, including the Federal Reserve.",2003-05-31
A quantitative inflation target or range has been shown in many countries to be a valuable tool for communication.,2003-05-31
"By clarifying the objectives of the central bank, an explicit inflation target can help to focus and anchor inflation expectations, reduce uncertainty in financial markets, and add structure to the policy framework.",2003-05-31
"For Japan, given the recent history of costly deflation, however, an inflation target may not go far enough.",2003-05-31
"A better strategy for Japanese monetary policy might be a publicly announced, gradually rising price-level target.",2003-05-31
"What I have in mind is that the Bank of Japan would announce its intention to restore the price level (as measured by some standard index of prices, such as the consumer price index excluding fresh food) to the value it would have reached if, instead of the deflation of the past five years, a moderate inflation of, say, 1 percent per year had occurred.",2003-05-31
"(I choose 1 percent to allow for the measurement bias issue noted above, and because a slightly positive average rate of inflation reduces the risk of future episodes of sustained deflation.)",2003-05-31
"Note that the proposed price-level target is a moving target, equal in the year 2003 to a value approximately 5 percent above the actual price level in 1998 and rising 1 percent per year thereafter.2 Because deflation implies falling prices while the target price-level rises, the failure to end deflation in a given year has the effect of increasing what I have called the price-level gap (Bernanke, 2000).",2003-05-31
The price-level gap is the difference between the actual price level and the price level that would have obtained if deflation had been avoided and the price stability objective achieved in the first place.,2003-05-31
"A successful effort to eliminate the price-level gap would proceed, roughly, in two stages.",2003-05-31
"During the first stage, the inflation rate would exceed the long-term desired inflation rate, as the price-level gap was eliminated and the effects of previous deflation undone.",2003-05-31
"Second, once the price-level target was reached, or nearly so, the objective for policy would become a conventional inflation target or a price-level target that increases over time at the average desired rate of inflation.3 Although restoration of the pre-deflation price level by means of a price-level target might be a reasonable interpretation of the BOJ's price stability objective, I would not want to push the purely legal argument too far.",2003-05-31
"For example, based on a mandate for price stability, I would not ask either the BOJ or the Federal Reserve to restore the price level prevailing in their respective nations in 1950!",2003-05-31
"Rather, I think the BOJ should consider a policy of reflation before re-stabilizing at a low inflation rate primarily because of the economic benefits of such a policy.",2003-05-31
"Since the early 1990s, borrowers in Japan have repeatedly found themselves squeezed by disinflation or deflation, which has required them to pay their debts in yen of greater value than they had expected.",2003-05-31
"A period of reflation would also likely provide a boost to profits and help to break the deflationary psychology among the public, which would be positive factors for asset prices as well.",2003-05-31
"Reflation--that is, a period of inflation above the long-run preferred rate in order to restore the earlier price level--proved highly beneficial following the deflations of the 1930s in both Japan and the United States.",2003-05-31
"In the United States, for example, prices fell at a 10.3 percent rate in 1932 but rose 0.8 percent in 1933 and more briskly thereafter.",2003-05-31
Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) have advanced a second argument for a price-level target for Japan in an important recent paper on monetary policy at the zero bound.,2003-05-31
"These authors point out (as have many others) that, when nominal interest rates are at or near zero, the central bank can lower the real rate of interest only by creating expectations of inflation on the part of the public.",2003-05-31
"Eggertsson and Woodford argue that a publicly announced price-level target of the type just described is more conducive to raising near-term inflation expectations than is an inflation target.4 One way to understand their argument is to imagine that the public expects the leaders of the central bank to take more aggressive actions, the further they are from their announced objective.",2003-05-31
"Now suppose that, in an economy experiencing a stable deflation, the central bank leadership announces a fixed inflation target but then makes no progress toward that target during a given period.",2003-05-31
"In this respect the inflation target is too ""forgiving"" an objective; failure is not penalized, nor is greater effort demanded.",2003-05-31
"In contrast, under a price-level-targeting scheme, continuing deflation combined with an upward-sloping path for the price-level target causes the size of the price-level gap to increase over time.",2003-05-31
"Thus, failure by the central bank to meet its target in a given period leads to expectations of (and public demands for) increased effort in subsequent periods--greater quantities of assets purchased on the open market, for example.",2003-05-31
"So even if the central bank is reluctant to provide a time frame for meeting its objective, the structure of the price-level objective provides a means for the bank to commit to increasing its anti-deflationary efforts when its earlier efforts prove unsuccessful.",2003-05-31
"As Eggertsson and Woodford show, the expectation that an increasing price level gap will give rise to intensified effort by the central bank should lead the public to believe that ultimately inflation will replace deflation, a belief that supports the central bank's own objectives by lowering the current real rate of interest.",2003-05-31
"A concern that one might have about price-level targeting, as opposed to more conventional inflation targeting, is that it requires a short-term inflation rate that is higher than the long-term inflation objective.",2003-05-31
"Is there not some danger of inflation overshooting, so that a deflation problem is replaced with an inflation problem?",2003-05-31
"However, on the other side of the scale, I would put the following points: first, the benefits to the real economy of a more rapid restoration of the pre-deflation price level and second, the fact that the publicly announced price-level targets would help the Bank of Japan manage public expectations and to draw the distinction between a one-time price-level correction and the BOJ's longer-run inflation objective.",2003-05-31
"If this distinction can be made, the effect of the reflation program on inflation expectations and long-term nominal interest rates should be smaller than if all reflation is interpreted as a permanent increase in inflation.",2003-05-31
"A Barrier to More Aggressive Policies: The BOJ's Balance Sheet Discussing the optimal objectives for Japanese monetary policy is all very well, but what of the argument, advanced by some officials, that the Bank of Japan lacks the tools to achieve these objectives?",2003-05-31
"Without denying the many difficulties inherent in making monetary policy in the current environment in Japan, I believe that not all the possible methods for easing monetary policy in Japan have been fully exploited.",2003-05-31
"Indeed, ironically, if the Bank of Japan were to succeed in replacing deflation with a low but positive rate of inflation, its reward would likely be substantial capital losses in the value of its government bond holdings arising from the resulting increase in long-term nominal interest rates.",2003-05-31
"With such concerns in mind, BOJ officials have said that a strengthening of the Bank's capital base is needed to allow it to pursue more aggressive monetary policy easing.",2003-05-31
"Second, an imaginable, though quite unlikely, possibility is that the Bank could suffer sufficient capital losses on its assets to make it unable to conduct open-market sales of securities on a scale large enough to meet its monetary policy objectives.",2003-05-31
"In short, one could make an economic case that the balance sheet of the central bank should be of marginal relevance at best to the determination of monetary policy.",2003-05-31
Under this proposal the Ministry of Finance would convert the fixed interest rates of the Japanese government bonds held by the Bank of Japan into floating interest rates.,2003-05-31
"This ""bond conversion""--actually, a fixed-floating interest rate swap--would protect the capital position of the Bank of Japan from increases in long-term interest rates and remove much of the balance sheet risk associated with open-market operations in government securities.",2003-05-31
"Although the MOF could insulate, without budgetary cost, the BOJ's balance sheet from interest-rate risk on its holdings of government bonds, a similar program offered by the MOF to private-sector holders of bonds, such as commercial banks, would not be costless from the MOF's point of view, if inflation and interest rates were subsequently to rise.7 However, if the MOF entered into the proposed swap agreement with the BOJ, new purchases of government bonds from the private sector by the Bank of Japan would be costless to the national treasury.",2003-05-31
"Thus, conditional on the swap arrangement being in force, open-market purchases of government bonds by the BOJ would combine an expansionary monetary policy with a reduction of interest-rate risk in the banking system at no budgetary cost.8 The simple step of immunizing the BOJ's balance sheet thus opens a number of interesting policy options.",2003-05-31
"The net effect would be that the fiscal authority would assume the credit risk flowing from the nonstandard monetary policy action, as seems appropriate.",2003-05-31
Today I will argue for a different approach and suggest that the Bank of Japan cooperate temporarily with the government to create an environment of combined monetary and fiscal ease to end deflation and help restart economic growth in Japan.,2003-05-31
"Monetary and Fiscal Cooperation There is no unique solution to the problem of continuing declines in Japanese prices; a variety of policies are worth trying, alone or in combination.",2003-05-31
"Demand on the part of both consumers and potential purchasers of new capital equipment in Japan remains quite depressed, and resources are not being fully utilized.",2003-05-31
"Normally, the central bank would respond to such a situation by lowering the short-term nominal interest rate, but that rate is now effectively zero.",2003-05-31
"Other strategies for the central bank acting alone exist, including buying alternative assets to try to lower term or liquidity premiums and attempting to influence expectations of future inflation through announcements or commitments to expand the monetary base.",2003-05-31
"The Bank of Japan has taken some steps in these directions but has generally been reluctant to go as far as it might, in part because of the difficulty in determining the quantitative impact of such actions and in part because of the Bank's view that problems in the banking system have ""jammed"" the usual channels of monetary policy transmission.",2003-05-31
The alternative approach to stimulating aggregate demand is fiscal policy--government spending increases or tax cuts.,2003-05-31
"In Posen's view, Japan's debt problem is primarily the result of slow economic growth rather than active fiscal policies.",2003-05-31
"The severity of the government debt problem may be overstated in some respects--95 percent of the outstanding debt is domestically held, for example, and 59 percent is held by public institutions, so that the Japanese people truly ""owe the debt to themselves""--but that the government's annual deficit is now about 8 percent of GDP is nevertheless a serious concern.",2003-05-31
"(It is striking that, despite low interest rates, about 20 percent of the Japanese central government budget, or about 16.8 trillion yen this year, is devoted to servicing the national debt.)",2003-05-31
"If, for example, people think that government spending projects are generally wasteful and add little to national wealth or productivity, then taxpayers may view increased government spending as simply increasing the burden of the government debt that they must bear.",2003-05-31
"Moreover, assume that the Bank of Japan has made a commitment, by announcing a price-level target, to reflate the economy, so that much or all of the increase in the money stock is viewed as permanent.9 Under this plan, the BOJ's balance sheet is protected by the bond conversion program, and the government's concerns about its outstanding stock of debt are mitigated because increases in its debt are purchased by the BOJ rather than sold to the private sector.",2003-05-31
"Essentially, monetary and fiscal policies together have increased the nominal wealth of the household sector, which will increase nominal spending and hence prices.",2003-05-31
"The health of the banking sector is irrelevant to this means of transmitting the expansionary effect of monetary policy, addressing the concern of BOJ officials about ""broken"" channels of monetary transmission.",2003-05-31
"This approach also responds to the reservation of BOJ officials that the Bank ""lacks the tools"" to reach a price-level or inflation target.",2003-05-31
"Indeed, nothing would help reduce Japan's fiscal woes more than healthy growth in nominal GDP and hence in tax revenues.",2003-05-31
"More generally, by replacing interest-bearing debt with money, BOJ purchases of government debt lower current deficits and interest burdens and thus the public's expectations of future tax obligations.",2003-05-31
"Of course, one can never get something for nothing; from a public finance perspective, increased monetization of government debt simply amounts to replacing other forms of taxes with an inflation tax.",2003-05-31
"But, in the context of deflation-ridden Japan, generating a little bit of positive inflation (and the associated increase in nominal spending) would help achieve the goals of promoting economic recovery and putting idle resources back to work, which in turn would boost tax revenue and improve the government's fiscal position.",2003-05-31
"Economically, however, it is important to recognize that the role of an independent central bank is different in inflationary and deflationary environments.",2003-05-31
"In the face of inflation, which is often associated with excessive monetization of government debt, the virtue of an independent central bank is its ability to say ""no"" to the government.",2003-05-31
I would like to close by reiterating a point I made earlier--that ending deflation in consumer prices is only part of what needs to be done to put Japan back on the path to full recovery.,2003-05-31
It seems however a good compromise choice between the more aggressive tack of trying to make up for the extensive unanticipated disinflation that occurred in the half decade prior to 1998 and the strategy of ignoring past deflation altogether and using 2003 as the base year.,2003-05-31
Some differences between inflation targeting and price-level targeting are interesting but they need not detain us here.,2003-05-31
"In my view, most contemporary inflation-targeting regimes actually practice a combination of inflation targeting and price-level targeting (or price-path targeting), in that overshoots or undershoots of inflation are usually partly, but not entirely, subsequently reversed.",2003-05-31
"However, these losses would be offset to some degree if nominal GDP were to grow with inflation, raising tax revenues.",2003-05-31
"This is a personal statement; I am not speaking for my current colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) or the many others with whom I have served over these many years.1 * * * The tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve in 1979, then led by my predecessor Paul Volcker, ultimately broke the back of price acceleration in the United States, ushering in a two-decade long decline in inflation that eventually brought us to the current state of price stability.",2004-01-03
"The fall in inflation over this period has been global in scope, and arguably beyond the expectations of even the most optimistic inflation fighters.",2004-01-03
I have little doubt that an unrelenting focus of monetary policy on achieving price stability has been the principal contributor to disinflation.,2004-01-03
"Indeed, the notion, advanced by Milton Friedman more than thirty years ago, that inflation is everywhere and always a monetary phenomenon is no longer a controversial proposition in the profession.",2004-01-03
But the size and geographic extent of the decline in inflation raises the question of whether other forces have been at work as well.,2004-01-03
"I am increasingly of the view that, at a minimum, monetary policy in the last two decades has been operating in an environment particularly conducive to the pursuit of price stability.",2004-01-03
"The principal features of this environment included (1) increased political support for stable prices, which was the consequence of, and reaction to, the unprecedented peacetime inflation in the 1970s, (2) globalization, which unleashed powerful new forces of competition, and (3) an acceleration of productivity, which at least for a time held down cost pressures.",2004-01-03
"But as we lived through it, there was much uncertainty about the evolving structure of the economy and about the influence of monetary policy.",2004-01-03
"Despite those uncertainties, the trauma of the 1970s was still so vivid throughout the 1980s that preventing a return to accelerating prices was the unvarying focus of our efforts during those years.",2004-01-03
"In recognition of the lag in monetary policy's impact on economic activity, a preemptive response to the potential for building inflationary pressures was made an important feature of policy.",2004-01-03
"* * * After an almost uninterrupted stint of easing from the summer of 1984 through the spring of 1987, the Fed again began to lean against increasing inflationary pressures, which were in part the indirect result of rapidly rising stock prices.",2004-01-03
The concern over the possible fallout on economic activity from so sharp a stock price decline kept us easing into early 1988.,2004-01-03
"However, the weakening of demand already under way, some pullback of credit by lenders, and the spike in oil prices associated with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait were sufficient to produce a marked contraction of activity in the fall of 1990.",2004-01-03
"Those headwinds were primarily generated by the constriction of credit in response to major losses at banks, associated with real-estate and foreign lending, coupled with a crisis in the savings and loan industry that had its origins in a serious maturity mismatch as interest rates rose.",2004-01-03
"The uptilt to the term structure of interest rates in a generally low interest rate environment restored bank profitability and, eventually, bank capital.",2004-01-03
"By early 1994, as the headwinds of financial restraint abated, it became clear that underlying price pressures were again building.",2004-01-03
The resulting rise in the funds rate of 300 basis points over twelve months apparently defused those nascent inflationary pressures.,2004-01-03
"Though economic activity hesitated in early 1995, it soon steadied, confirming the achievement of a historically elusive soft landing.",2004-01-03
One was the expectation that inflation could be controlled over the business cycle and that price stability was an achievable objective.,2004-01-03
"The second expectation, in part a consequence of more stable inflation, was that overall economic volatility had been reduced and would likely remain lower than it had previously.",2004-01-03
"In particular, the prospect that a necessary cyclical adjustment was now behind us fostered increasing levels of optimism, which were manifested in a fall in bond risk spreads and a rise in stock prices.",2004-01-03
"The associated decline in the cost of equity capital further spurred already developing increases in capital investment and productivity growth, both of which broadened impressively in the latter part of the 1990s.",2004-01-03
"The rise in structural productivity growth was not obvious in the official data on gross product per hour worked until later in the decade, but precursors had emerged earlier.",2004-01-03
"Moreover, even though hourly labor compensation and profit margins were rising, prices were being contained, implying increasing growth in output per hour.2 As a consequence of the improving trend in structural productivity growth that was apparent from 1995 forward, we at the Fed were able to be much more accommodative to the rise in economic growth than our past experiences would have deemed prudent.",2004-01-03
Those views were reinforced as inflation continued to fall in the context of a declining unemployment rate that by 2000 had dipped below 4 percent in the United States for the first time in three decades.,2004-01-03
Notions that prevailed for a time in the 1970s and early 1980s that even high single-digit inflation did not measurably impede economic growth were gradually abandoned as the evidence of significant benefits of low inflation became increasingly persuasive.,2004-01-03
"Moreover, the variance of GDP growth markedly lessened as inflation tumbled from its double-digit high in the early 1980s.",2004-01-03
Our goal of price stability was achieved by most analysts' definition by mid-2003.,2004-01-03
"Throughout the period, a key objective has been to ensure that our response to incipient changes in inflation was forceful enough.",2004-01-03
"As John Taylor has emphasized, in the face of an incipient increase in inflation, nominal interest rates must move up more than one-for-one.3 * * * Perhaps the greatest irony of the past decade is that the gradually unfolding success against inflation may well have contributed to the stock price bubble of the latter part of the 1990s.4 Looking back on those years, it is evident that technology-driven increases in productivity growth imparted significant upward momentum to expectations of earnings growth and, accordingly, to stock prices.5 At the same time, an environment of increasing macroeconomic stability reduced perceptions of risk.",2004-01-03
"The sharp rise in stock prices and their subsequent fall were, thus, an especial challenge to the Federal Reserve.",2004-01-03
"In fact, our experience over the past two decades suggests that a moderate monetary tightening that deflates stock prices without substantial effect on economic activity has often been associated with subsequent increases in the level of stock prices.6 Arguably, markets that pass that type of stress test are presumed particularly resilient.",2004-01-03
We were able to be unusually aggressive in the initial stages of the recession of 2001 because both inflation and inflation expectations were low and stable.,2004-01-03
"We thought we needed to be, and could be, forceful in 2002 and 2003 as well because, with demand weak, inflation risks had become two-sided for the first time in forty years.",2004-01-03
But highly aggressive monetary ease was doubtless also a significant contributor to stability.9 * * * The Federal Reserve's experiences over the past two decades make it clear that uncertainty is not just a pervasive feature of the monetary policy landscape; it is the defining characteristic of that landscape.,2004-01-03
"As a consequence, the conduct of monetary policy in the United States has come to involve, at its core, crucial elements of risk management.",2004-01-03
"In essence, the risk management approach to monetary policymaking is an application of Bayesian decisionmaking.",2004-01-03
"This framework also entails devising, in light of those risks, a strategy for policy directed at maximizing the probabilities of achieving over time our goals of price stability and the maximum sustainable economic growth that we associate with it.",2004-01-03
The product of a low-probability event and a potentially severe outcome was judged a more serious threat to economic performance than the higher inflation that might ensue in the more probable scenario.,2004-01-03
"That possibility of higher inflation caused us little concern at the time, largely because increased productivity growth was resulting in only limited increases in unit labor costs and heightened competition, driven by globalization, was thwarting employers' ability to pass through those limited cost increases into prices.",2004-01-03
"Such a cost-benefit analysis is an ongoing part of monetary policy decisionmaking and causes us to tip more toward monetary ease when a contractionary event, such as the Russian default, seems especially likely or the costs associated with it seem especially high.",2004-01-03
"Because economies, of necessity, are net long--that is, have net real assets--attempts to flee these assets cause prices of equity assets to fall, in some cases dramatically.",2004-01-03
"The channels of monetary policy, consequently, are changing in tandem.",2004-01-03
"For example, it is difficult to have much confidence in the ability of models fit to the data of the moderate inflations of the postwar period to accurately predict what the behavior of the economy would be in an environment of aggregate price deflation.",2004-01-03
"For example, inferences about how market participants and, hence, the economy might respond to a monetary policy initiative may need to be drawn from evidence about past behavior during a period only roughly comparable to the current situation.",2004-01-03
"Indeed, rules that relate the setting of the federal funds rate to the deviations of output and inflation from their respective targets, in some configurations, do seem to capture the broad contours of what we did over the past decade and a half.",2004-01-03
"* * * While all, no doubt, would prefer that it were otherwise, there is no way to dismiss what has to be obvious to every monetary policymaker: The success of monetary policy depends importantly on the quality of forecasting.",2004-01-03
The emergence of inflation targeting in recent years is an interesting development in this regard.,2004-01-03
"As practiced, it emphasizes forecasts, but within a more rule-like structure that skews monetary policy toward inflation containment as the primary goal.",2004-01-03
"Indeed, its early applications were in high-inflation countries where discretionary monetary policy fell into disrepute.",2004-01-03
"Inflation targeting often originated as a fairly simple structure concentrating solely on inflation outcomes, but it has evolved into more-discretionary forms requiring complex judgments for implementation.",2004-01-03
"Indeed, this evolution has gone so far that the actual practice of monetary policy by inflation-targeting central banks now closely resembles the practice of those central banks, such as the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Federal Reserve, that have not chosen to adopt that paradigm.",2004-01-03
"In practice, most central banks, at least those not bound by an exchange rate peg, behave in roughly the same way.",2004-01-03
"They seek price stability as their long-term goal and, accounting for the lag in monetary policy, calibrate the setting of the policy rate accordingly.",2004-01-03
"Central banks generally appear to have embraced a common model of the channels through which monetary policy functions, although the specifics and emphasis given to those channels vary according to our particular circumstances.",2004-01-03
"All banks ease when economic conditions ease and tighten when economic conditions tighten, even if in differing degrees, regardless of whether they are guided by formal or informal inflation targets.",2004-01-03
"As yet unresolved is whether the mere announcement that a central bank intends to engage in inflation targeting increases the credibility of the central bank's inclination to maintain price stability and, hence, assists in the anchoring of inflation expectations.",2004-01-03
"But, presumably, we will not know for sure the significance of formal inflation targeting as a tool until the world economy is subjected to shocks of sufficient magnitude to assess the differential performance of those who do not employ formally announced inflation targets.",2004-01-03
"To date, inflation has fallen for formal targeters, but it has fallen for others as well.",2004-01-03
* * * Under the rubric of risk management are a number of specific issues that we at the Fed had to address over the past decade and a half and that will likely resurface to confront future monetary policymakers.,2004-01-03
Most prominent is the appropriate role of asset prices in policy.,2004-01-03
"In addition to the narrower issue of product price stability, asset prices will remain high on the research agenda of central banks for years to come.",2004-01-03
"As the ratios of gross liabilities and gross assets to GDP continue to rise, owing to expanding domestic and international financial intermediation, the visibility of asset prices relative to product prices will itself rise.",2004-01-03
"There is little dispute that the prices of stocks, bonds, homes, real estate, and exchange rates affect GDP.",2004-01-03
"But most central banks have chosen, at least to date, not to view asset prices as targets of policy, but as economic variables to be considered through the prism of the policy's ultimate objective.",2004-01-03
"* * * As the transcripts of FOMC meetings attest, making monetary policy is an especially humbling activity.",2004-01-03
"In hindsight, the paths of inflation, real output, stock prices and exchange rates may have seemed preordained, but no such insight existed as we experienced it at the time.",2004-01-03
"Yet, during the last quarter century, policymakers managed to defuse dangerous inflationary forces and dealt with the consequences of a stock market crash, a large asset price bubble, and a series of liquidity crises.",2004-01-03
These events did not distract us from the pursuit and eventual achievement of price stability and the greater economic stability that goes with it.,2004-01-03
Less will be required from the risk-laden initiatives of monetary policymakers.,2004-01-03
"Indeed, in the presentation of its twice yearly Monetary Policy Report to the Congress, the Federal Reserve Board reports the projections of Federal Open Market Committee participants regarding core PCE inflation, not headline inflation, the latter of which includes all items in the price index.",2007-10-20
"Here in Canada, unlike in the United States, the central bank maintains an explicit inflation target.",2007-10-20
"The Bank of Canada states its target in terms of the headline consumer price index, and although this choice of inflation measure contrasts with the Federal Reserve's preferred index, the difference is not nearly as great as it appears on the surface.",2007-10-20
"In fact, the Bank of Canada monitors a number of inflation measures and uses core inflation as an ""operational guide"" in coming to its monetary policy decisions and discussing these decisions with the public.",2007-10-20
Does it make sense for a central bank to concentrate on core inflation?,2007-10-20
"After all, households almost daily pay for energy and food itemsâ€‘â€‘which are excluded from the most prominent measures of core inflationâ€‘â€‘when they fill up their cars at gas stations or visit a grocery store.",2007-10-20
"A focus on core inflation, which excludes these items, might be viewed as indicating that monetary policy makers are out of touch with what consumers really care about.",2007-10-20
Wouldn't it be better for monetary policy authorities to focus on headline inflation so that they include food and energy in their monitoring of consumer price inflation?,2007-10-20
"It does indeed make sense for central banks to emphasize headline inflation when determining the appropriate stance of monetary policy over the medium run, but policymakers also are right to emphasize core inflation when deciding how to adjust policy from meeting to meeting.",2007-10-20
"Because what central bankers are truly concerned withâ€‘â€‘both for the purposes of internal deliberations and for communications with the publicâ€‘â€‘is the underlying rate of inflation going forward, and core inflation can be a useful proxy for that rate.",2007-10-20
"Thus, focusing on core inflation can help prevent a central bank from responding too strongly to transitory movements in inflation.",2007-10-20
"Why Monetary Policy Should Focus on Core Inflation Because households care about the prices of all the items they buy, it clearly does not make sense to pretend that people do not eat or drive.",2007-10-20
"Thus, I have no qualm in stating that controlling headline inflation, not core inflation, isâ€‘â€‘along with maintaining maximum sustainable employmentâ€‘â€‘the ultimate aim of monetary policy.",2007-10-20
"Nonetheless, I will argue that it is still useful for monetary policy makers to focus on core inflation when deciding how to respond to incoming economic news.",2007-10-20
"Although monetary policy is capable of controlling overall inflation in the long run, it does not have the ability to control relative price movements such as those for food and energy.",2007-10-20
"When a cold snap freezes the Florida orange crop or a tropical storm hits the gasoline refineries along the Gulf Coast, monetary policy cannot reverse the resulting spikes in prices for fresh orange juice or for gasoline at the pump.",2007-10-20
Temporary supply shocks such as these raise the prices of food and energy relative to other prices and can have substantial effects on inflation in the short run.,2007-10-20
"By including all itemsâ€‘â€‘including particularly volatile items like food and energyâ€‘â€‘headline measures of inflation are inherently noisy and often do not reflect changes in the underlying rate of inflation, the rate at which headline inflation is likely to settle and that monetary policy can affect.",2007-10-20
Measures of core inflation attempt to strip out or smooth volatile changes in particular prices to distinguish the inflation signal from the transitory noise.,2007-10-20
"Thus, relative to changes in headline inflation measures, changes in core measures are much less likely to be reversed, provide a clearer picture of the underlying inflation pressures, and so serve as a better guide to where headline inflation itself is heading.",2007-10-20
"Of course, if a particular shock to noncore prices is not temporary but, rather, turns out to be more persistent, then the higher costs are likely to put some upward pressure on core prices.",2007-10-20
"However, research has shown that, over the past twenty-five years or more, headline inflation in the United States has tended to revert more strongly toward core inflation than core inflation has moved toward headline inflation.2 As that record suggests, core measures often are much better than headline indexes at providing a first approximation of the permanent changes to inflation.",2007-10-20
"When headline inflation has an important transitory component, a focus on core measures can help avoid monetary policy mistakes.",2007-10-20
"If the monetary authorities react to headline inflation numbers, they run the risk of responding to merely temporary fluctuations in inflation.",2007-10-20
"We can think about this danger by considering a supply shock, that causes the relative price of energy to increase sharply, as in fact has happened over the past three years.",2007-10-20
Let us suppose that we start out with both headline and core inflation at acceptably low levels.,2007-10-20
"First, let's consider a supply shock that temporarily raises the price of energy by a large amount.",2007-10-20
In this case headline inflation will rise well above its underlying trend as the price of energy rises but will soon fall well below its underlying trend as the price of energy falls back to its initial level.,2007-10-20
"On average, inflation will remain unchanged without any monetary policy action.",2007-10-20
"But a tightening of monetary policy in reaction to the rise in headline inflation would lead to a decline in employment and inflation; and because of the long lags between monetary policy actions and changes in economic activity, that decline would occur some time down the road, when inflation would more likely be at or below its underlying trend.",2007-10-20
The outcome of such a policy would be a more pronounced fall in inflation with a decline in employment.,2007-10-20
"Such a policy would be bad indeed because it would increase volatility in inflation and employment, which is the opposite of what a central bank should be trying to achieve as it seeks to promote price stability and maximum sustainable employment.",2007-10-20
But what if a supply shock leads to a permanent shift in the relative price of energy?,2007-10-20
"Indeed, almost all commentators characterize the current oil price shock that way, in part because they see the rise of new economic powers like China as adding to the demand for energy in the foreseeable future.",2007-10-20
"Although in that case the rise in relative energy prices is not reversed, the rate of change in energy prices does not persist: Headline inflation will rise with the increase in energy prices, but once energy prices reach their permanently high level, headline inflation will revert to its underlying trend rate.",2007-10-20
"Thus, as long as the permanent change in relative energy prices does not lead to a change in the underlying trend rate of inflationâ€‘â€‘a crucial assumptionâ€‘â€‘then headline inflation will come back down again.",2007-10-20
"From a low near $30 per barrel in late 2003, the price of oil rose to $70 per barrel by the middle of 2006, and it has stayed high, with the current price more than $80.",2007-10-20
"That move increased headline PCE inflation to the 4 percent level for a time, but it has since retreated to around 2 percent (figure 1).",2007-10-20
"Monetary policy clearly can do little about the first-round effects of a permanent rise in energy prices, which include both its direct impact on the energy component of overall consumer prices and the pass-through of higher energy costs into prices of non-energy goods and services.",2007-10-20
But policy does have a critical role to play in determining the second-round effects associated with changes in the underlying trend rate of inflation.,2007-10-20
"Such second-round effects are likely to be quite limited as long as the rise in the relative price of energy does not lead to a rise in long-run inflation expectations, as has largely been the case in the recent period (figure 1).",2007-10-20
"With such a commitment firmly established, monetary policy then does not need to respond as much to the temporary rise in headline inflation to stabilize inflation over the longer run.",2007-10-20
"Under these circumstances, if monetary policy is tightened appreciably in the face of a surge in headline inflation, the policy would likely be excessively tight and lead to an unnecessary decline in employment.",2007-10-20
"Because the point about headline inflation is so important, I would like to illustrate it further with simulations of FRB/US, the model of the U.S. economy created and maintained by the staff at the Federal Reserve Board.",2007-10-20
"To keep the experiments as clean as possible, I assume that the economy begins at full employment and with both headline and core inflation at desired levels.",2007-10-20
The economy is then assumed to experience a shock that raises the world price of oil about $30 per barrel over two years; the shock is assumed to slowly dissipate thereafter.,2007-10-20
"In each of two scenarios, a Taylor rule is assumed to govern the response of the federal funds rate; the only difference between the two is that in one scenario the funds rate responds to core PCE inflation, while in the other it responds to headline PCE inflation.3 Figure 2 illustrates the results of these two scenarios.",2007-10-20
"The federal funds rate jumps higher and faster when the central bank responds to headline inflation rather than to core inflation, as would be expected (top-left panel).",2007-10-20
"Likewise, responding to headline inflation pushes the unemployment rate markedly higher than otherwise in the early going (top-right panel), and produces an inflation rate that is slightly lower than otherwise, whether measured by core or headline indexes (bottom panels).",2007-10-20
"More important, even for a shock as persistent as this one, the policy response under headline inflation has to be unwound in the sense that the federal funds rate must drop substantially below baseline once the first-round effects of the shock drop out of the inflation data.",2007-10-20
"Responding to headline inflation is therefore inappropriate because it generates extensive variability in the unemployment rateâ€‘â€‘variability that is much more subdued when policy responds to core inflation.4 Of course, the pitfalls associated with reacting to realized headline inflation, as illustrated by this simulation, are well understood.",2007-10-20
"Accordingly, advocates of targeting headline inflation generally have in mind a strategy of responding to forecasts of headline inflationâ€‘â€‘forecasts that try to take account of inflation movements that are likely to be transitory.",2007-10-20
"This is a further illustration of my basic point, namely, that it is important to distinguish between transitory and persistent inflation movements, and focusing on core inflation can help achieve that end.5 The focus on core instead of headline inflationâ€‘â€‘and clear communication with the public about that focusâ€‘â€‘can have another benefit: It may help anchor inflation expectations when headline inflation increases temporarily but core inflation remains essentially unchanged.",2007-10-20
"If the public understands that the central bank is using core inflation in formulating monetary policy and trusts that the central bank is right to do so, the public will realize that the central bank does not need to respond aggressively to a surge in headline inflation to keep inflation under control.",2007-10-20
"And, with core inflation stable, the public will be less likely to think that the central bank has weakened its commitment to a strong nominal anchor when it does not tighten monetary policy to stabilize headline inflation.",2007-10-20
"The result is that inflation expectations are likely to remain anchored, which may lead to better outcomes not only on inflation but on employment as well, because the central bank will not have had to tighten monetary policy as much in response to the energy price shock.",2007-10-20
"As I noted earlier, figure 1 offers some support for this view: It shows that the rise in headline inflation in the 2004-06 period, when core inflation remained quite stable, did not lead to an appreciable rise in long-run inflation expectations, even with a substantial decline in unemployment during this period.",2007-10-20
Is Inflation Excluding Food and Energy the Best Measure of Underlying Inflation?,2007-10-20
The most popular core inflation measures used and published in the United States are quite straightforward: They simply exclude changes in food and energy prices.,2007-10-20
"For example, many of the food categories excluded in the standard measure of core inflation, such as food away from home (restaurants), are not highly volatile and so likely should remain in an optimal core inflation measure.",2007-10-20
"On the other hand, some items that are not excluded from the U.S. core measures, such as airline fares, tobacco, and apparel, are extremely volatile and thus are unlikely to be included in an optimal core inflation measure.",2007-10-20
"The Bank of Canada, for example, uses a more targeted approach to its core inflation indicator, the CPIX.",2007-10-20
"However, Canada's CPIX also excludes intercity transportation and tobacco, which are included in the U.S. core measures.6 Another approach to estimating core inflation measures is statistical, in which certain prices are excluded at each point on the basis of statistical criteria.",2007-10-20
"Among these statistical measures are trimmed indexes, such as the trimmed mean and the weighted median consumer price indexes produced by the Cleveland Fed and the trimmed mean PCE price index produced by the Dallas Fed.",2007-10-20
"Each month, these measures throw out the components with the largest price changes, both positive and negative (though the Dallas measure is asymmetric).7 Other approaches to estimating core inflation are theory-based measures employing common trends, unobserved components, or a particular model of the economy.8 However, these theory-based approaches tend to be rather complex and require faith that the model they are based on is the right one.",2007-10-20
"Each of these measures of core inflation can be evaluated according to a variety of criteria, including the ability to forecast headline inflation over some period and the degree of correlation with alternative definitions of trend inflation.",2007-10-20
"According to some of these criteria, statistical and theory-based approaches are sometimes found to outperform simpler exclusion measures of core inflation, like the standard one excluding food and energy.",2007-10-20
"As you can tell, this is an active area of research, but recent research done at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on U.S. data finds that no one particular core measure, including the standard one, dominates the others: The relative performance of different core measures varies depending on the choice of the price index, the sample period, and the criteria for evaluating their performance (Rich and Steindel, 2007).",2007-10-20
"These features of the standard core measure therefore make it a credible device to keep inflation expectations anchored when supply shocks occur: If the standard measure remains stable, then a surge in headline inflation is less likely to unhinge inflation expectations, which as we have seen can lead to both better inflation and better employment performance.",2007-10-20
"Why Central Banks Should also Focus on Headline Inflation Despite the advantages of core measures of inflation, their use in conducting monetary policy has been criticized.9 Core measures of inflation attempt to remove the most volatile or transitory components of the inflation measure.",2007-10-20
"But, because the nature of price shocks may change over time, items that have been highly volatile in the past may not be so in the future; hence, any core measure will itself likely be subject to transitory shocks.",2007-10-20
"Unfortunately, as noted above, empirical research suggests that no one measure of core inflation will work in all situations.",2007-10-20
"Therefore, central banks do not focus solely on core inflation; rather, they devote considerable resources to understanding inflation developments in an effort to distinguish signal from noise in the incoming data.10 Another reason to keep watch over the broader inflation picture is that, if the rate of change in the price of an excluded item receives a permanent shock, then the headline inflation rate can deviate from the core measure for an extended period of time.",2007-10-20
"The longer this period of high headline inflation persists, the greater is the risk of second-round effects as the public begins to build this higher inflation into its expectations.",2007-10-20
"For example, from 1987 to 2002, energy price shocks appear to have been temporary in that energy prices were mean reverting; as a result, in this period, the average difference between core and headline PCE inflation was quite small.",2007-10-20
"Since 2002, however, the effect of energy price shocks have been more persistent, and headline inflation has averaged more than 1/2 percentage point above core inflation over this period.",2007-10-20
"Over the past year, energy prices have about leveled off on balance--or at least that was the case until a couple of weeks ago--and the rate of headline inflation for most of this year has come down close to that for core, one hopes alleviating the risk of second-round effects.",2007-10-20
But the increases in oil prices in recent days provide another reminder that shocks can persist longer than one might have at first expected.,2007-10-20
A prolonged divergence between core and headline measures of inflation could complicate central bank communications with the public because core inflation would require some adjustment before it would provide a clear gauge of underlying inflation.,2007-10-20
"For example, the weighted median CPI inflation rate, one popular measure of core inflation, has tended to be a biased measure of headline inflation.",2007-10-20
"However, the productivity growth rate in residential construction is not terribly high, and so this sector is likely to have below-average productivity growth and above-average price increases.",2007-10-20
"Indeed, the weighted median CPI exceeded overall CPI inflation on average by 1/4 percentage point per year over the decade from 1992 to 2002, a period when changes in energy prices were transitory.",2007-10-20
"Of course, to the extent that such a bias in a core inflation measure is stable or predictable, the central bank could easily take this into account in setting monetary policy.",2007-10-20
"But even in that case, differences in average rates of inflation between the core measure and overall inflation could complicate communication with the public.",2007-10-20
"Conclusion I have argued that a measure of core inflation that is easily understood and provides some greater signal about persistent movements in inflation than does headline inflation itself is extremely valuable for the conduct of monetary policy, and that is why the Federal Reserve pays so much attention to such measures.",2007-10-20
A single core inflation measure cannot account for all types of shocks and can at times be misleading about what is happening to the underlying rate of overall inflation.,2007-10-20
"Yet, although the image of free market capitalism has been elevated throughout the world from its sorry state at the end of World War II, the application of it within the United States, its largest adherent, is regrettably incomplete: Too many barriers still prevent the free flow of capital and people to their most productive employment.",1998-01-16
"This conference is addressing one result of those barriers, the underemployment of a significant segment of our population.",1998-01-16
"I would like to address two aspects of the issue of underemployment of minorities: first, the implications of ignoring the potential that already exists and, second, the need to encourage young people to seek the types of education and training that will meet the demands of work in the twenty-first century.",1998-01-16
"Prices, interest rates, stock prices, and other signals produced by market economies to encourage the distribution of productive resources have no inherent moral content.",1998-01-16
"However, to the extent that market participants discriminate--consciously or, more likely, unconsciously--the setting of wages and prices and the distribution of output are distorted.",1998-01-16
"Indeed, the growth of minority-owned small businesses is truly impressive.",1998-01-16
The number of black-owned firms increased nearly 50 percent and the number of Hispanic-owned firms jumped 80 percent between 1987 and 1992--between two and three times the rate of growth of non-minority-owned firms.,1998-01-16
"More recent data are not available, but I suspect that trend has continued since 1992 as the strong performance of the economy, coupled with generally ample availability of credit, has created an environment conducive to the birth and growth of innovative enterprises of all ownership types.",1998-01-16
"The fast-paced technological change of recent years and the growth of the conceptual component of our nation's output has brought with it increased demands for workers who are equipped not simply with technical know-how but with the ability to create, analyze, and transform information and to interact effectively with others.",1998-01-16
"Our future entrepreneurs, too, must be prepared to compete in an environment in which the largest part of the growth in output is the result of new insights.",1998-01-16
"To do this will demand not only greater specialized knowledge, but also an ability to deal with risk and uncertainty.",1998-01-16
"Traditionally, broader human capital skills have been associated with higher education, and, accordingly, the demand for college-trained workers has been increasing rapidly.",1998-01-16
"While the higher demand has induced more people to enroll in college, the supply of college graduates has lagged behind the growing demand.",1998-01-16
"I have no illusions that the task of breaking down barriers that have produced the gaps in income, wealth, and employment will be simple.",1998-01-16

(via webcast) Share It is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today at the 2020 Annual Membership Meeting of the Institute of International Finance.1 I regret that we are not doing this session in person, and I hope the next time Tim Adams invites me back, we will be gathering together in Washington.",2020-10-14
"I look forward, as always, to my conversation with Tim, but first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and our new monetary policy framework.",2020-10-14
"The flow of macrodata received since May has been surprisingly strong, and GDP growth in the third quarter is estimated by many forecasters to have rebounded at perhaps a 25 to 30 percent annual rate.",2020-10-14
This development is especially noteworthy when set in relief against the surge in new COVID-19 cases that were reported this summer in a number of U.S. states and the coincident flatlining in a number of high-frequency activity indicators that we follow to track the effect of the virus on economic activity.,2020-10-14
These components of aggregate demand have benefited from robust fiscal supportâ€”including the Paycheck Protection Program and expanded unemployment benefitsâ€”as well as low interest rates and efforts by the Federal Reserve to sustain the flow of credit to households and firms.,2020-10-14
"In the labor market, about half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in the spring have been restored, and the unemployment rate has fallen since April by nearly 7 percentage points to 7.9 percent as of September.",2020-10-14
It will likely take even longer than that for the unemployment rate to return to a level consistent with our maximum-employment mandate.,2020-10-14
"However, it is worth highlighting that the Committee's baseline projections summarized in the most recent Summary of Economic Projections foresee a relatively rapid return to mandate-consistent levels of employment and inflation as compared with the recovery from the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).2 In particular, the median Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participant projects that by the end of 2023â€”a little more than three years from nowâ€”the unemployment rate will have fallen to 4 percent, and PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation will have returned to 2 percent.",2020-10-14
"Following the GFC, it took more than eight years for employment and inflation to return to similar mandate-consistent levels.",2020-10-14
"The September FOMC Decision and the New Monetary Policy Framework At our September FOMC meeting, the Committee made important changes to our policy statement that upgraded our forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate, and that also provided unprecedented information about our policy reaction function.",2020-10-14
"We indicated that, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, our policy will aim to achieve inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal.",2020-10-14
"We said that we expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomesâ€”as well as our maximum-employment mandateâ€”are achieved, and also that we expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.",2020-10-14
The September FOMC meeting was the first since the Committee approved in August our new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy and adopted a new policy framework.3 The changes we made in our September FOMC statement bring our policy guidance in line with this new framework.,2020-10-14
"In our new framework, we acknowledge that policy decisions going forward will be based on the FOMC's estimates of ""shortfalls [emphasis added] of employment from its maximum level""â€”not ""deviations.""",2020-10-14
"This language means that going forward, a low unemployment rate, in and of itself, will not be sufficient to trigger a tightening of monetary policy absent any evidence from other indicators that inflation is at risk of moving above mandate-consistent levels.",2020-10-14
"With regard to our price-stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importanceâ€”and the challengeâ€”of keeping inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent in a world in which an effective-lower-bound constraint is, in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate.",2020-10-14
"To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it ""seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,"" andâ€”in the same sentenceâ€”that therefore ""following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.""",2020-10-14
"As Chair Powell indicated in his Jackson Hole remarks, we think of our new framework as an evolution from ""flexible inflation targeting"" to ""flexible average inflation targeting.",2020-10-14
"""4 While this new framework represents a robust evolution in our monetary policy strategy, this strategy is in service to the dual-mandate goals of monetary policy assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congressâ€”maximum employment and price stabilityâ€”which remain unchanged.5 Concluding Remarks While economic recovery since the spring collapse has been robust, let us not forget that full economic recovery from the COVID-19 recession has a long way to go.",2020-10-14
"Although the unemployment rate has declined sharply since April, it remains elevated as of September at 7.9 percent and would be about 3 percentage points higher if labor force participation remained at February 2020 levels.",2020-10-14
"Moreover, despite a recent uptick, inflation is still running below our 2 percent longer-run objective.",2020-10-14
"It will take some time to return to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the business cycle peak in February, and additional support from monetaryâ€”and likely fiscalâ€”policy will be needed.",2020-10-14
"The motivation for granting independence to central banks is to insulate the conduct of monetary policy from political interference, especially interference motivated by the pressures of elections to deliver short-term gains irrespective of longer-term costs.",2000-10-24
"The intent of this insulation is not to free the central bank to pursue whatever policy it prefers--indeed every country specifies the goals of policy to some degree--but to provide a credible commitment of the government, through its central bank, to achieve those goals, especially price stability.",2000-10-24
The history of the Federal Reserve's relationship to the rest of government is one marked by efforts by the rest of government both to foster central bank independence and to exert political pressure on monetary policy.,2000-10-24
"If a central bank is free to set the final objectives for monetary policy, it has goal independence.",2000-10-24
"However, countries vary considerably in the specificity of the mandated goals and hence in the degree of discretion of central banks in the conduct of monetary policy.",2000-10-24
This phenomenon has been called the political business cycle in which pre-election stimulus leads to higher inflation followed by monetary restraint after the election.,2000-10-24
"On the other hand, it appears that elected officials in many countries apparently understood the incentives under which they operate and have structured charters for their central banks that, in effect, tie their own hands--that is, limit political interference with monetary policy to enhance the prospects of achieving and maintaining price stability.",2000-10-24
"In addition, budget priorities and monetary policy objectives can be in conflict.",2000-10-24
"The executive branch generally wants to keep the cost of servicing its debt low, and this preference might be at odds with the need for monetary policy to vary interest rates to maintain price stability.",2000-10-24
"Finally, especially in countries where debt markets are not well developed, central banks might be called upon to finance budget deficits by printing money, again interfering with maintaining price stability.",2000-10-24
Some have worried that even an independent central bank could succumb to the temptation to stimulate the economy today at the expense of higher inflation in the future.,2000-10-24
"That is, the central bank has an incentive to commit itself to price stability and then to renege on this promise in order to gain employment in the short run with relatively little initial sacrifice in the form of higher inflation.",2000-10-24
In the long run inflation would rise and the central bank would either have to tolerate the higher rate of inflation or push output below potential for a while to restore price stability.,2000-10-24
"Once the public understood this process, moreover, it would expect higher inflation, so that, in the longer run, the result could be higher inflation without any short-run gain in output.",2000-10-24
"The rule would ensure a credible commitment to price stability, thereby anchoring the public's expectations and removing the inflationary bias that otherwise might result.",2000-10-24
"Second, the government could appoint conservative central bankers--central bankers with a greater commitment to price stability than the public--and thereby offset the inflationary bias that would otherwise arise.",2000-10-24
"Third, central bankers could be forced to operate under performance or incentive contracts, whereby they could be penalized for failure to maintain price stability.",2000-10-24
The Governor of the Bank of New Zealand operates under such a performance contract; he can be removed from office for failure to achieve his inflation target.,2000-10-24
They will therefore be reluctant to undermine their credibility over the longer run by pretending to pursue price stability while stimulating the economy for short-run gain.,2000-10-24
"Still, the problem highlighted in the time inconsistency literature may reinforce the case for both a price stability legislative mandate and instrument independence for the central bank.",2000-10-24
Independence also is likely to reinforce the credibility of a central bank's commitment to price stability.,2000-10-24
"First, it could allow the central bank to reduce the cost of lowering inflation.",2000-10-24
"It is generally agreed that to lower inflation monetary policy must reduce output for a while, relative to potential, by reducing aggregate demand.",2000-10-24
The resulting loss of output during the transition to lower inflation is a measure of the cost of reducing inflation.,2000-10-24
"The more quickly inflation expectations fall, the more rapidly will inflation itself decline, and the lower will be the cost of reducing inflation.",2000-10-24
"If aggregate demand were to slow, a stimulative monetary policy move would be less likely to undermine confidence in the central bank's pursuit of price stability when the central bank is independent (and has a price stability mandate).",2000-10-24
"In addition, if inflation moved upward, inflation expectations would be less likely to follow immediately, making it easier for the central bank to contain inflation.",2000-10-24
"The empirical studies generally find an inverse relationship between measures of central bank independence and both average inflation and variability of inflation, at least for developed economies.",2000-10-24
The inverse relationship could also reflect the fact that countries with less aversion to inflation might be less likely to have independent central banks.,2000-10-24
"In addition, there is no consistent evidence of a relationship between central bank independence and real economic activity nor consistent evidence that central bank independence lowers the cost of reducing inflation or increases the effectiveness of stabilization policy.",2000-10-24
"Recently, the Ministry of Finance indeed asked the policy committee of the Bank of Japan to delay a decision to raise the Bank's target interest rate.",2000-10-24
"The European Central Bank (ECB) began operating on June 1, 1998, and assumed responsibility for monetary policy in the euro area on January 1, 1999.",2000-10-24
The European Parliament carries out oversight hearings on monetary policy but does not have any authority with respect to the ECB.,2000-10-24
"Independence and the Federal Reserve System The Federal Reserve, created in 1913, was established as an independent central bank--although, at the time, it was given no clear concept of its role in the conduct of monetary policy.",2000-10-24
"During the first half century of Federal Reserve history, the Congress continued to focus more on issues involving the structure of the Federal Reserve than on providing a clear legislative mandate for monetary policy or oversight of the conduct of monetary policy.",2000-10-24
"A former Fed governor, Andrew Brimmer, in a 1989 paper entitled ""Politics and Monetary Policy: Presidential Efforts to Control the Federal Reserve,"" describes the record of almost ""continuous and at least public and vigorous conflicts"" between Presidents and the Federal Reserve.",2000-10-24
"In his view, twelve of the fourteen Presidents between the founding of the Federal Reserve and the time he was writing--from Woodrow Wilson to George Bush--had ""some kind of public debate, conflict, or criticism of Federal Reserve monetary policy,"" the exceptions being Calvin Coolidge and Gerald Ford.",2000-10-24
"He alleged that Presidents resented the delegation of monetary policy by the Congress to an independent Federal Reserve and sought ways to bring monetary policy under their influence, often by exerting direct political pressure on the Federal Reserve, but principally through the appointment process.",2000-10-24
"Thomas M. Havrilesky, in a 1992 book, also provides an account of, and some attempts to measure, the intensity of political pressure over time, based on the number of comments on monetary policy made by Administration officials, including the President, and by members of the Congress.",2000-10-24
But to my knowledge the Administration has never made any public or private effort to influence monetary policy.,2000-10-24
"The Administration wanted to shift the power over monetary policy toward the centralized and presidentially appointed Federal Reserve Board governors, a group they had a better opportunity to influence through the appointment process.",2000-10-24
"During both World Wars, Treasury wanted to issue securities at low interest rates to ease the burden of financing and the Fed went along because it felt bound to facilitate wartime financing.",2000-10-24
"After World War I, the Treasury opposed raising the discount rate to combat inflation, but the Fed did so anyway.",2000-10-24
"After the war, the Fed wanted to resume an independent monetary policy, fearing that it would otherwise become an engine of inflation, but the Treasury was still concerned about minimizing the service cost of the debt.",2000-10-24
"Under the terms of the Accord, as it came to be known, the Fed was no longer obligated to peg the interest rates on Treasury debt, but it was agreed that active consultation between the Fed and Treasury would continue.",2000-10-24
"From the end of World War II until the mid-1970s, the mandate for monetary policy was based on the Employment Act of 1946.",2000-10-24
"The act identified the government's macroeconomic policy objectives as fostering ""conditions under which there will be useful employment opportunities…for those able, willing, and seeking to work, and to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power.""",2000-10-24
President Johnson did not want the Administration's stimulative fiscal policy undermined by restrictive monetary policy.,2000-10-24
Chairman Martin supported an increase in the discount rate as an appropriate step to contain the risk of higher inflation.,2000-10-24
The Congress became more involved in the monetary policy process in the 1970s.,2000-10-24
"This was a response to both poor economic performance and changing views about the importance of monetary aggregates in shaping economic developments, especially inflation.",2000-10-24
Inflation began to rise in the late 1960s and escalated further in the 1970s.,2000-10-24
"During this period, monetarism was an increasing influence, with its focus on the importance of limiting the rate of growth of the money supply to control inflation.",2000-10-24
But it was the sharp recession in 1974-75 that really provoked the Congress to provide more detailed instructions to the Federal Reserve about the objectives that should guide monetary policy.,2000-10-24
"In 1975, the House and Senate passed Concurrent Resolution 133 calling on the Fed to lower long-term interest rates and expand the monetary and credit aggregates to promote recovery.",2000-10-24
The Fed was also instructed to set money growth targets and to participate in periodic congressional hearings on monetary policy.,2000-10-24
"For the first time, the Congress explicitly identified the objectives for monetary policy.",2000-10-24
"Still, with its focus on the conduct of monetary policy at a point in time (rather than on general guidelines on policy objectives to be applied over time), the resolution was a clear instance of action by the Congress to intervene and influence monetary policy.",2000-10-24
"The monetary policy objectives written into the concurrent resolution were added by an amendment to the Federal Reserve Act in 1977 and were further elaborated in the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978, often referred to as the Humphrey Hawkins act after its co-sponsors.",2000-10-24
Another clear attempt at political interference emerged in February 1988 when an undersecretary of the Treasury sent a letter to Federal Reserve officials urging them to ease monetary policy.,2000-10-24
"As a result, the Congress is now reconsidering the monetary policy oversight process.",2000-10-24
"In part because the link between money growth and nominal spending appears to be less tight than it was earlier, the role of money growth in monetary policy deliberations has diminished and it appears likely that the Congress will no longer require the Fed to set and report money growth ranges.",2000-10-24
"However, the current language about the objectives of monetary policy seems likely to be retained, as does semiannual testimony on monetary policy.",2000-10-24
"The legislation creating an ""independent"" central bank--or in many cases revisions to such legislation--often entirely takes away goal independence by mandating objectives for monetary policy, but otherwise sets up a structure that confers and protects instrument independence.",2000-10-24
The most important requirement for instrument independence is that the central bank be the final authority on monetary policy.,2000-10-24
"That is, monetary policy decisions should not be subject to veto by the executive or legislative branches of government.",2000-10-24
Instrument independence is further protected if other institutions of government are not represented on the monetary policy committee.,2000-10-24
"Instrument independence is further facilitated by long, overlapping terms for members of the monetary policy committee; by limited opportunities for reappointment; and by committee members not being subject to removal except for cause--where ""cause"" refers to fraud or other personal misconduct but explicitly excludes differences in judgment about policy.",2000-10-24
"As I noted above, the Treasury or Finance Ministry will have an incentive to keep interest rates low to reduce the cost of servicing the government debt.",2000-10-24
"If independence is also defined in terms of assuring the ability and commitment of the central bank to achieve price stability, this commitment can be protected by an explicit price stability mandate from the government.",2000-10-24
"Independence, by this definition, is viewed as greatest if price stability is the exclusive objective of monetary policy, or at least the principal objective.",2000-10-24
"Empirical Studies of the Relative Independence of CentralBanks Studies of the economic consequences of central bank independence typically estimate the economic effects by first deriving quantitative measures of the relative independence of central banks and then estimating how this measure is correlated with average inflation, inflation variability, and real economic performance.",2000-10-24
"Grilli, Masciandro, and Tabellini (1991) also incorporated information on the length of terms of monetary policy committee members and on policy goals of the central bank with respect to monetary policy, specifically whether there is a mandate for monetary stability (including money growth or price stability objectives).",2000-10-24
The Federal Reserve lost points in these rankings because of the brevity of the Chairman's term (less than five years) and the failure to single out price stability as the unique or principal objective.,2000-10-24
"Grilli, Masciandro, and Tabellini and Cukierman also included in their measures the nature of monetary policy objectives, ranking independence higher if there is a price stability objective and, in Cukierman's case, higher still if price stability is the only or at least principal objective.",2000-10-24
"In the latter case, a central bank with more discretion--for example, as a result of multiple objectives, as in the case of the United States--is ranked as less independent than a central bank that has little discretion on account of a single, precisely defined price stability objective.",2000-10-24
"Of course, defining independence to involve a mandate making price stability the single or principal objective increases the potential for an inverse relationship between ""independence"" and inflation.",2000-10-24
But accountability is the critical mechanism for ensuring both that the central bank is operated in a way consistent with democratic ideals and that the central bank operates under incentives to meet its legislative mandate for monetary policy.,2000-10-24
Two aspects of designing the objectives for monetary policy are important.,2000-10-24
"First, a single objective (typically price stability) makes the central bank more accountable, because multiple targets always carry trade-offs, at least in the short-run, which are subject to the discretion of the central bank.",2000-10-24
"Specifically, an explicit numerical inflation target makes the central bank more accountable than a more general commitment to price stability.",2000-10-24
"First, if there is a single target for a central bank, it will surely be price stability, given that monetary policy is the principal, even unique, determinant of inflation in the long run.",2000-10-24
"Indeed, given the inescapable trade-off between inflation variability and output variability, a central bank naturally, even inevitably, accounts for the variability of output around full employment when deciding how rapidly to try to restore price stability in cases where shocks or policy mistakes move the economy away from this goal.",2000-10-24
"Inflation-targeting central banks often take account of output variability by defining a period of time over which any return to price stability should occur, typically two years.",2000-10-24
"In addition, they provide an important opportunity for the President to try to influence monetary policy decisions by pressures exerted on the Chairman subsequent to appointment.",2000-10-24
"On the other hand, the long and effectively nonrenewable terms for governors would protect the fundamental independence of monetary policy.",2000-10-24
"With respect to monetary policy, it refers to the immediacy with which the public learns of policy decisions and the amount of information provided about the rationale for policy actions and the assessment of how possible future developments bear on policy.",2000-10-24
"The Congress has, over time, made efforts to increase the transparency of the monetary policy process and widen the scope of disclosures of monetary policy decisions and of the discussions leading up to those decisions.",2000-10-24
Transparency is influenced by the operating procedures used to implement monetary policy.,2000-10-24
"This was a very imprecise way of setting and explaining policy, making it more difficult for the public and the Congress to monitor and evaluate monetary policy decisions.",2000-10-24
"The effect of monetary policy derives not only from the explicit policy actions taken, but also from expectations about future policy.",2000-10-24
"When the Congress learned of the availability of the transcripts, they demanded that they be released to the public, and the current procedures were negotiated between the Federal Reserve and the Congress.",2000-10-24
The transcripts are a useful historical record of FOMC meetings and provide scholars as well as current Board members with insights into the monetary policy process and its evolution over time.,2000-10-24
"The executive and legislative branches collectively set fiscal policy, while the central bank sets monetary policy.",2000-10-24
The appropriate monetary policy must give substantial weight to prevailing and expected fiscal policies.,2000-10-24
I say to a lesser extent because I believe fiscal policies since the early 1980s have been set more on the basis of longer-run considerations--such as promoting growth--than for short-run stabilization purposes.,2000-10-24
"The forecast of the central bank must consider current and prospective fiscal policies, and monetary policy must adjust to fiscal policy changes, while the executive and legislative branches are somewhat freer to implement changes in long-run strategies as the political consensus allows or dictates.",2000-10-24
"On the other hand, the absence of active stabilization efforts by the executive branch (and the Congress) might increase their frustration about the stabilization policies pursued by the Federal Reserve--or perhaps more likely at the perceived failure of the Federal Reserve to pursue full employment aggressively enough--and increase efforts at political interference with the conduct of monetary policy.",2000-10-24
The Eisenhower Administration established an Advisory Board on Economic Growth and Stabilization (ABEGS) which included the chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers and the Fed Chairman--initially Arthur Burns and William McChesney Martin respectively--plus cabinet members.,2000-10-24
"During that period, fiscal policy had a more prominent role in stabilization policy, with monetary policy playing a more supporting role.",2000-10-24
This was the most dramatic example of attempted political interference with the conduct of monetary policy after the 1951 Accord.,2000-10-24
"This change reflects the smaller role of fiscal policy in stabilization ever since the early 1980s, when the Reagan Administration shifted the focus to longer-run issues related to encouraging more rapid trend growth.",2000-10-24
"Stabilization policy since that time has been dominated by the Federal Reserve, with coordination of policies becoming especially important at major turning points in the thrust of fiscal policy--for example, when the Clinton Administration decided to make a reduction in the structural federal budget deficit the centerpiece of its economic policy strategy in 1993.",2000-10-24
"Given the Treasury's respect for the independence of the Fed, participants will rarely discuss monetary policy, although they occasionally touch on the economic outlook.",2000-10-24
"Once again, discussions of the economic outlook and monetary policy are rare.",2000-10-24
"But the discussions often involve interesting issues related to the outlook, such as the sources of the increases in productivity growth and why most other countries have not benefited significantly thus far from the same developments.",2000-10-24
"This power is a rather blunt instrument, providing ample opportunity for the Federal Reserve to take advantage of its independence in the conduct of monetary policy.",2000-10-24
"At the same time, it ensures that the Federal Reserve is extremely respectful of the oversight authority of the Congress and provides some leverage for congressional influence on the conduct of monetary policy.",2000-10-24
It is sometimes difficult to separate direct political involvement in monetary policy from essential congressional oversight of monetary policy.,2000-10-24
"Today it seems out of place for the Administration to comment directly on the conduct of monetary policy, though this may reflect the extraordinary relationship between this Administration and the Federal Reserve and the exceptional economic environment of the last several years.",2000-10-24
"At any rate, for the present, the relationship between the Administration and the Federal Reserve on monetary policy is confined to the President's making appointments to the Board while the members of the administration and the Board (and especially the Chairman and the Secretary of the Treasury) engage in regular but informal consultations.",2000-10-24
"On the other hand, the Congress cannot fulfill its oversight responsibilities without actively engaging the Federal Reserve in a dialogue about the conduct of monetary policy.",2000-10-24
"The Congress conveys its views on monetary policy through a variety of vehicles, including letters, speeches, statements and questions at hearings, committee reports on monetary policy, and bills and resolutions.",2000-10-24
The Congress over the years has used a variety of approaches to influence monetary policy.,2000-10-24
"Perhaps most important, the Congress has set the goals for monetary policy in law.",2000-10-24
"The Congress can, if it decides, pass legislation that directly requires a specific monetary policy action.",2000-10-24
"The Congress can threaten to change the structure of the Federal Reserve--abolish the Federal Reserve at the extreme, or specify particular qualifications for Board members, or alter the composition of the FOMC--in an attempt to influence monetary policy.",2000-10-24
"The Congress can demand an accounting of policy by summoning the Chairman, Board members, and Reserve Bank presidents to congressional hearings, in addition to the formal semiannual testimonies by the Chairman.",2000-10-24
"The line between oversight and direct involvement in the conduct of policy is perhaps crossed when the Congress passes or even introduces a resolution or legislation that gives specific direction to raise or lower interest rates and, especially, when such directions are accompanied by proposed legislation that would reduce the independence of the Federal Reserve.",2000-10-24
"The history of the past twenty years shows that members of the Congress do try to influence monetary policy, especially when the economy is performing poorly or when interest rates are high or rising, but that the Congress has rarely gone so far as to pass legislation to direct policy.",2000-10-24
"Indeed, the introduction of such legislative mandates may be thought of as one way the Congress tries to persuade the Federal Reserve to alter its conduct of monetary policy.",2000-10-24
"There are, to my knowledge, only one or two examples of legislation that passed with specific monetary policy directives and thus compromised the delegation of instrument independence to the Federal Reserve.",2000-10-24
"At the end of November 1982, forty-two Senate Democrats introduced a resolution calling on the Fed to ""achieve low enough interest rates to generate significant economic growth and thereby reduce the current intolerable level of unemployment.""",2000-10-24
"However, the final language in the continuing resolution included an important qualification that, in effect, left the discretion about the conduct of monetary policy to the Federal Reserve.",2000-10-24
"Specifically, the Congress added the qualifying phrase ""with due regard for combating inflation.""",2000-10-24
"Second, we have to accept a certain amount of grumbling about the decisions that impose short-run costs, especially when unemployment is high or policy tightens preemptively to contain what the Fed perceives as inflation risks.",2000-10-24
"When the President and congressional majority are from different parties, party politics can affect the Federal Reserve and may explain, in part, why today the Board has two vacancies plus a governor who is serving after the expiration of his term (since a governor can continue to serve in such a case until reappointed or until a new governor is appointed and confirmed).3 In recent years, delayed action on nominations for governor or renomination as chairman, has served as a vehicle for some Senators to express displeasure with the conduct of monetary policy.4 Another important relationship with the Congress is through hearings.",2000-10-24
"The Chairman testifies frequently before the Congress, with the one-year record being twenty-five appearances in 1995, although only seven were directly about monetary policy.",2000-10-24
Typically the Chairman alone testifies on monetary policy.,2000-10-24
"The most important testimony on monetary policy is delivered at semiannual hearings before the House and the Senate that began, as I mentioned, with the now-expired provisions of the Humphrey-Hawkins act.",2000-10-24
"These meetings are rarely about monetary policy and most focus on regulatory issues, including banking bills and the Community Reinvestment Act, but they are also sometimes about global economic developments, international financial crises, or international financial architecture issues.",2000-10-24
"Finally, members of the Congress often write letters to the Board--individually and in groups--typically urging a specific direction for monetary policy.",2000-10-24
"Since joining the Board in June 1996, I have seen numerous such letters--all either expressing concern about high interest rates or, in most cases, urging the FOMC either to not raise interest rates or to lower them.",2000-10-24
"The largest number of signers during this period was eighty, for a September 23, 1996 letter urging the FOMC not to raise interest rates.",2000-10-24
"These letters are perhaps best understood as attempts by the Congress to alert the Fed to the pain of constituents as a byproduct of the conduct of monetary policy--typically when the Fed is preemptively raising interest rates in an effort to prevent higher inflation or trying to unwind an earlier increase in inflation, or not sufficiently stimulating a sluggish economy.",2000-10-24
"Once having admonished us in an effort to make sure we understood the consequences of our policies, the Congress has generally relied on us to balance inflation and stabilization objectives, as is the implicit contract under a regime under which the Congress has delegated instrument independence to the Federal Reserve.",2000-10-24
There has long been a small group in the Congress who would like to revise the language related to the policy mandate to elevate the role of price stability to the single or at least principal objective for monetary policy.,2000-10-24
They press this issue not out of dissatisfaction with the conduct of monetary policy but because they believe such a revised policy mandate would strengthen the credibility of the Federal Reserve's commitment to price stability and thereby allow the central bank to carry out this commitment in the most efficient way.,2000-10-24
"However, a larger, if less vocal, group in the Congress strongly opposes abandoning a commitment by the Federal Reserve to promote full employment through its conduct of monetary policy.",2000-10-24
"The mandate, for example, sets out full employment and price stability as objectives but leaves to the Federal Reserve the precise definition of those goals.",2000-10-24
"As recent experience confirms, it would be difficult and unwise to set any numerical target for full employment, given the uncertainty about what that target should be and the likelihood that this target would vary over time with demographic changes in the labor force, government policies, and changes in the efficiency of the matching process between jobs and unemployed workers.",2000-10-24
The Federal Reserve has never set an explicit numerical target for inflation.,2000-10-24

"Current Economic Situation and Outlook While the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has taken a tragic human toll measured in terms of lives lost and suffering inflicted, as a direct result of the necessary public health policies put in place to mitigate and control the spread of the virus, the pandemic has also inflicted a heavy toll on the levels of activity and employment in the U.S. economy.",2020-05-21
"The unemployment rate, which was at a 50â€‘year low of 3.5 percent as recently as February, surged in April by more than 10 percentage points to 14.7 percent, an 80-year high, and it is likely to rise further in May.",2020-05-21
"At a minimum, the easing of financial conditions is buying some time until the economy can begin to recover, growth resumes, and unemployment begins to fall.",2020-05-21
"In my baseline view, while I do believe it will likely take some time for economic activity and the labor market to fully recover from the pandemic shock, I do project right now that the economy will begin to grow and that the unemployment rate will begin to decline starting in the second half of this year.",2020-05-21
"In terms of inflation, my projection is for the COVID-19 contagion shock to be disinflationary, not inflationary, and the data we are seeing so far are consistent with this projection.",2020-05-21
"For example, core CPI (consumer price inflation) prices fell 0.45 percent in April, the largest monthly decrease since the beginning of the series in 1957.",2020-05-21
"While the COVID-19 shock is disrupting both aggregate demand and supply, the net effect, I believe, will be for aggregate demand to decline relative to aggregate supply, both in the near term and over the medium term.",2020-05-21
"If so, this decrease will put downward pressure on core inflation, which was already running somewhat below our 2 percent objective when the downturn began in March.",2020-05-21
"Moreover, as I have indicated previously, I judge that measures of longer-term inflation expectations were, when the downturn began, at the low end of a range that I consider consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.",2020-05-21
"The Policy Response At the Federal Reserve, we take our dual-mandate obligations of maximum employment and price stability very seriously, and, since March 3, we have deployed our entire toolkit to provide critical support to the economy during this challenging time.",2020-05-21
"In our FOMC statements, we have indicated we expect to maintain the target range at this level until we are confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.",2020-05-21
"On March 16, we launched a program to purchase Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities in whatever amounts needed to support smooth market functioning, thereby fostering effective transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.",2020-05-21
"The Fed is not authorized to grant money to particular beneficiaries, to meet the payroll expenses of small businesses, or to underwrite the unemployment benefits of displaced workers.",2020-05-21
Direct fiscal support for the economy is thus also essential to sustain economic activity and complement what monetary policy cannot accomplish on its own.,2020-05-21
"Concluding Remarks The coronavirus pandemic poses the most serious threat to maximum employment and, potentially, to price stability that the United States has faced in our lifetimes.",2020-05-21
"As Laura requested several months ago, my topic this evening will be the ""new economy"" and more specifically the growth of labor productivity.",2002-10-24
The answer--I submit--is not that the productivity of my fellow economists is low or that the economics profession has failed in a key mission.,2002-10-24
"Rather, it is that the underlying sources of productivity growth are very complex.",2002-10-24
"On the surface, the determinants of productivity growth might seem straightforward: factors such as technological progress, capital deepening, and the changing institutional structure of labor and product markets.",2002-10-24
"Thus, before embarking on any serious discussion of productivity growth, one must recognize the very difficult measurement challenges that we face.",2002-10-24
"But if we are consistent in our methods, I believe both our aggregate statistics and also microeconomic studies of productivity growth at the firm and industry level can yield important insights.",2002-10-24
"With that caveat about productivity measurement aside, let me state right from the outset of this lecture that I continue to be cautiously optimistic about productivity growth in the United States.",2002-10-24
"Based on my reading of the data and my understanding of numerous business case studies, I believe that trend labor productivity in the United States accelerated in the mid-1990s.",2002-10-24
"But other factors were also at work, including well-aligned monetary and fiscal policies that created an economic environment conducive to noninflationary economic growth.",2002-10-24
The Statistical Evidence I think it would be useful at this point to review what the data actually tell us about the pattern of productivity growth in the United States.,2002-10-24
"From the beginning of 1960 until the fall of 1973, labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector grew about 3 percent per year.",2002-10-24
"Productivity growth then fell to an annual pace of 1-1/2 percent, likely in response to the supply shocks that hit the world economy during that period, higher inflation, a rise in uncertainty about the prospects for future economic growth, and public policy decisions that diverted resources from activities that would have generated more measured output.",2002-10-24
"I should stress that, although I have listed several likely contributors, the ultimate cause or causes of this post-1973 productivity slowdown have eluded researchers.",2002-10-24
Productivity continued to grow at an annual pace of about 1-1/2 percent from 1973 to 1995.,2002-10-24
"We can divide this period into several subperiods, yet the results are essentially the same: continued gains in labor productivity but well below the pre-1973 pace.",2002-10-24
"From 1995 to 2001, labor productivity grew at an annual pace of 2-1/4 percent.",2002-10-24
Research by my colleagues at the Federal Reserve--Steve Oliner and Dan Sichel--sheds some light on the sources of this faster productivity growth.,2002-10-24
"Using a growth accounting methodology, they find that about half the acceleration in productivity can be attributed to capital deepening.",2002-10-24
"At the aggregate level, the high levels of business investment raised the amount of capital per worker and thereby boosted productivity.",2002-10-24
The other half of the pickup in productivity growth reflected technological innovations in the actual production of computer hardware and semiconductors as well as better management--perhaps assisted by these high-tech investments--of the nation's capital and labor.,2002-10-24
"Oliner and Sichel estimate that, if one consolidates all the influences of high-tech investments, they fully account for the acceleration in productivity over the 1995-2001 period.",2002-10-24
I mention this fact to address the concerns of some observers that recent revisions to the national income and product accounts have changed the evidence on post-1995 productivity growth.,2002-10-24
"The last two annual revisions have indeed lowered output growth, but these adjustments followed several years of upward revisions.",2002-10-24
Research by Board economists--Karen Dynan and Doug Elmendorf--clearly shows that we initially overestimate growth during recessions and periods of economic weakness.,2002-10-24
But we also initially underestimate growth in recovery periods.,2002-10-24
"Thus, based on the revisions to growth over the past three years, I do not believe that one should presume that future data revisions will whittle away the post-1995 acceleration in productivity.",2002-10-24
Microeconomic studies provide corroborating information to the macroeconomic evidence of a post-1995 acceleration in productivity growth.,2002-10-24
"These executives consistently say that, when they have little leverage to raise their prices, the key to boosting profits is productivity growth.",2002-10-24
"Having said that I think the post-1995 productivity acceleration was real, let me also assert that we should constantly challenge our assumptions.",2002-10-24
"Furthermore, we don't understand how this overinvestment should be factored into our analysis of productivity growth over this period.",2002-10-24
"Similarly, I don't think we yet fully understand the role of Year 2000 preparations in either the late 1990s investment boom or the acceleration in productivity.",2002-10-24
"Billions of dollars were invested to fix the Y2K bug, and we don't know how much of that spending was for the replacement of obsolete systems (and hence should be considered as depreciation in measuring the stock of available capital) or for the expansion and upgrading of systems (which, parenthetically, is the assumption we use in all our growth accounting exercises).",2002-10-24
Current and Prospective Productivity Growth The cyclical slowing in 2001 and gradual expansion in 2002 have raised a critical issue.,2002-10-24
That question is: Will productivity growth in the years ahead more closely resemble the substantial gains over the 1960-73 period or the weaker performance of the 1973-95 slowdown?,2002-10-24
"I tend to believe that future growth will most likely follow the 1960-73 pattern, and the most recent record of productivity growth reinforces that view.",2002-10-24
Productivity is a cyclical variable that typically falls in recessions.,2002-10-24
"However, during the most recent downturn, productivity never declined and instead continued to grow at a fairly strong pace.",2002-10-24
"Moreover, after the tragic events of September 11, many economists feared that the U.S. economy would weaken substantially and that productivity growth would suffer a severe setback as well.",2002-10-24
"After September 11, many businesses sharply reduced their payrolls in anticipation of a slump in demand.",2002-10-24
"But demand continued to grow briskly, and these companies learned to squeeze more output out of a smaller workforce.",2002-10-24
"Adjusting to new technologies takes time, and it is plausible that such an adjustment process has continued to boost productivity growth in recent years.",2002-10-24
"More fundamentally, I believe that the trend in productivity growth has ratcheted up, and this development has been the driving force behind the recent extraordinary productivity growth.",2002-10-24
Some analysts have cited the low level of business confidence today and the possibility that it could inhibit economic growth.,2002-10-24
"Others contend that productivity growth itself can be a problem because efficiency gains are achieved by a reduction in payrolls, which tends to deflate aggregate demand.",2002-10-24
"But, this pain is transitory, and ultimately, the faster productivity growth raises real wages, stimulates growth in real incomes, and contributes to an increase in our standard of living.",2002-10-24
"In many cases, new technologies are introduced into our economy through capital investment, and the important productivity gains of recent years will not be repeated unless businesses continue to invest in new plant and equipment.",2002-10-24
"However, a period of inadequate corporate investment that results in ""capital shallowing"" rather than capital deepening would almost surely hurt our productivity performance.",2002-10-24
"Although some industries have suffered severe losses and have sharply curtailed their capital expenditures, other sectors have posted growth in earnings and have continued to invest.",2002-10-24
"And ultimately, if I'm right about the stronger underlying pace of productivity growth, aggregate profits will continue to recover once the sectoral imbalances are eliminated.",2002-10-24
"In the 1990s, the high-tech boom appears to have been sparked by the confluence of three key trends: the rapid growth in computing power generated by explosive advances in semiconductor technology; the advent of new networking technologies that permitted computers to communicate more easily with each other in private networks and through the public Internet; and the development of software programs that facilitated these interactions and greatly expanded the uses of personal computers.",2002-10-24
"Ultimately, more businesses entered the high-tech field than could be supported by the substantial growth in demand in this sector.",2002-10-24
"In the end, the economy was left with an overhang of high-tech capital, which is exerting a drag on economic activity to this day.",2002-10-24
"Nonetheless, the ongoing evolution of these technologies is continuing to generate productivity gains.",2002-10-24
"Conclusion To sum up, none of us, obviously, can see the future, and instead we shall have to monitor incoming data closely for evidence of any shifts in recent productivity trends.",2002-10-24
"Nonetheless, I remain cautiously optimistic that the U.S. economy can continue to enjoy strong productivity-led growth that will raise living standards in the years to come.",2002-10-24
"Global supply chains have eased significantly, but by some measures they are still more constrained than at nearly any time since the late 1990s.2 High inflation places a burden on all Americans, but especially lower-income families, who spend three-fourths of their income on necessitiesâ€”more than twice the share spent by higher-income families.",2022-10-10
"The Federal Reserve has tightened policy strongly to bring inflation down, and U.S. tightening is being amplified by concurrent foreign tightening.",2022-10-10
"We are starting to see the effects in some areas, but it will take some time for the cumulative tightening to transmit throughout the economy and to bring inflation down.",2022-10-10
"Higher interest rates are working to temper demand and bring it into better alignment with supply, which is still constrained.",2022-10-10
"As a result of the significant increase in interest rates and associated tightening in broader financial conditions, I now expect that the second-half rebound will be limited, and that real GDP growth will be essentially flat this year.3 The moderation in demand due to monetary policy tightening is only partly realized so far.",2022-10-10
"The transmission of tighter policy is most evident in highly interest-sensitive sectors like housing, where mortgage rates have more than doubled year to date and house price appreciation has fallen sharply over recent months and is on track to soon be flat.",2022-10-10
"In other sectors, lags in transmission mean that policy actions to date will have their full effect on activity in coming quarters, and the effect on price setting may take longer.",2022-10-10
The moderation in demand should be reinforced by the concurrent rapid global tightening of monetary policy.,2022-10-10
"Against the backdrop of slower output growth, we are seeing some tentative signs of rebalancing in the labor market.",2022-10-10
"Anecdotal reports suggest the availability and retention of workers are improving.4 For the second month in a row, growth in monthly payroll employment stepped down, slowing from 315,0000 in August to 263,000 in September.",2022-10-10
"The ratio of job openings to job seekers declined to 1.7; for purposes of comparison, this ratio was 1.2 prior to the pandemic.5 The sharp fall in vacancies at a time when initial claims held steady at low levels provides support for the possibility that businesses that faced significant challenges finding and retaining qualified workers following the pandemic may be more inclined than in past cycles to retain rather than lay off their workers as demand weakens.",2022-10-10
"In particular, there is still a sizable 1.2 million shortfall in employment levels relative to pre-pandemic levels in the in-person services sectors that accounted for the majority of September payroll gains, suggesting businesses in those sectors may still be trying to narrow that gap.6 That said, a variety of indicators suggest labor demand remains strong, while labor supply remains below pre-pandemic conditions.",2022-10-10
"The unemployment rate is now at the very low level that prevailed pre-pandemic, and the volume of quits remains elevated.7 This supplyâ€“demand imbalance in the labor market is reflected in strong wage growth.",2022-10-10
The employment cost index increased by an annual rate of 6.3 percent over the second quarterâ€”its highest level in decades.,2022-10-10
"A more-timely data source, average hourly earnings, decelerated slightly to a 4.4 percent annual rate over the third quarter, down from 4.6 percent annual growth in the second quarter.",2022-10-10
"Although it is well above levels consistent with 2 percent inflation, wage growth has been running below current inflation.",2022-10-10
Strong wage growth along with high rental and housing costs mean that inflation from core services is expected to ease only slowly from currently elevated levels.,2022-10-10
"In contrast, core goods have been expected to return to something closer to the pre-pandemic trend of modest disinflation as a result of demand rotation away from goods to services, coupled with the healing of supply chains and declining core import prices.",2022-10-10
Disinflation in core goods would help to offset the inflationary pressures in services.,2022-10-10
"During the five years before the crisis, core goods made a small negative contribution to inflation.",2022-10-10
"The contribution of core goods to inflation swung sharply into positive territory in 2021, and had started to step down somewhat in the middle part of 2022.8 So the surprise in the August inflation data was the large contribution of core goods inflation to overall inflation at a point in the post-pandemic recovery when many forecasts anticipated this contribution would continue moderating.",2022-10-10
"Since the pandemic, significant supply and demand imbalances have coincided with large increases in retail trade margins in several sectors.",2022-10-10
"The return of retail margins to more normal levels could meaningfully help reduce inflationary pressures in some consumer goods, considering that gross retail margins are about 30 percent of total sales dollars overall.",2022-10-10
"For instance, among general merchandise retailers, where the real inventory-to-sales ratio is 20 percent above its pre-pandemic level, retail margins have increased 20 percent since the onset of the pandemic, roughly double the 9 percent increase in average hourly earnings by employees in that sector.9 In the auto sector, where the real inventory-to-sales ratio is 20 percent below its pre-pandemic level, the retail margin for motor vehicles sold at dealerships has increased by more than 180 percent since February 2020, 10 times the rise in average hourly earnings within that sector.10 So there is ample room for margin recompression to help reduce goods inflation as demand cools, supply constraints ease, and inventories increase.",2022-10-10
"Despite the higher prices for a broad set of goods and services, market- and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are within ranges consistent with expectations that inflation will return to 2 percent over the medium term.11 Treasury Inflation-Protected Securitiesâ€“based measures of five-year, five-year-forward breakeven inflation compensation are currently at 2.15 percent, roughly 10 basis points below their level at the start of the year.",2022-10-10
"The median of inflation expectations over the next 5 to 10 years in the Michigan survey ticked down in September to 2.7 percent, below the 2.9 to 3.1 percent range in which it had been fluctuating since July 2021 and back within the range that was common before the 2015 decline in this metric.12 Currently, there is a greater dispersion than usual of views about future inflation in survey responses.",2022-10-10
"Previously this reflected a rise in expectations for significantly above-target inflation, but now that dispersion also reflects expectations on the part of one quarter of respondents that prices are likely be the same or below their current level 5 to 10 years in the future.",2022-10-10
"In order to bring inflation down and to keep inflation expectations solidly anchored at 2 percent, the Federal Reserve has increased the federal funds rate target range by 300 basis points in the past seven months, and both market and policymaker surveys indicate additional increases through the end of this year and into next year.",2022-10-10
The Board's broad dollar index has appreciated 11 percent year to date.13 Monetary policy tightening is also proceeding rapidly abroad.,2022-10-10
"The Federal Reserve takes into account the spillovers of higher interest rates, a stronger dollar, and weaker demand from foreign economies into the United States, as well as in the reverse direction.",2022-10-10
"And we are also very aware that the cross-border effects of unexpected movements in interest rates and exchange rates, as well as worsening external imbalances, in some cases could interact with financial vulnerabilities.",2022-10-10
"That said, the real yield curve is now in solidly positive territory at all but the very shortest maturities, and the entire real curve will soon move into positive territory with the additional tightening and deceleration in inflation that are expected over coming quarters.",2022-10-10
Monetary policy will be restrictive for some time to ensure that inflation moves back to target over time.,2022-10-10
It will take time for the cumulative effect of tighter monetary policy to work through the economy broadly and to bring inflation down.,2022-10-10
"In light of elevated global economic and financial uncertainty, moving forward deliberately and in a data-dependent manner will enable us to learn how economic activity, employment, and inflation are adjusting to cumulative tightening in order to inform our assessments of the path of the policy rate.",2022-10-10
"While everyone understood that considerable uncertainties--related to economic assumptions and future policy decisions--surrounded these projections, they required that the Federal Reserve take seriously the possibility that monetary policy might have to be conducted without Treasury securities.",2001-10-12
"In discussing the implications for monetary policy, it is useful to separate monetary policy actions into two steps.",2001-10-12
"I will be discussing some options for adapting the implementation of monetary policy to a world without Treasury securities, but the key message is not to worry.",2001-10-12
"There are plenty of options, the Fed will get the job done, so the elimination of Treasury debt would not undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy.",2001-10-12
Monetary Policy Today The federal funds rate is the rate that banks charge for lending reserves to other banks.,2001-10-12
It is therefore fundamentally determined by supply and demand in the reserves market.,2001-10-12
"The Fed, technically, buys the underlying asset for a given price with an agreement by the selling institution to buy it back at a specified date and price.",2001-10-12
The difference between the purchase and buyback prices determines the interest rate on the loan (the repo rate).,2001-10-12
"Principles Before considering how to replace Treasury securities in the implementation of monetary policy, I find it useful to set out some principles that have, at least implicitly, traditionally been followed.",2001-10-12
The role of monetary policy is to promote price stability and maximum sustainable employment by influencing the level of aggregate demand through changes in the federal funds rate.,2001-10-12
A liquid market permits transactions to be made quickly and with negligible direct effects on the price of the assets bought and sold.,2001-10-12
The federal funds rate and expectations about future monetary policy then affect a wide range of other interest rates--on longer-term instruments and in both the government and private bond markets.,2001-10-12
"By operating in a broad and liquid market, the Fed can inject and withdraw reserves without having much direct effect on the prices of the asset being bought and sold.1 Finally, the Fed would prefer to avoid credit risk in its portfolio.",2001-10-12
"Managing credit risk is a role for financial intermediaries, not monetary policymakers.",2001-10-12
"Monetary Policy in a World without Treasuries Today, monetary policy decisions are implemented through a mix of outright purchases and sales of assets held in the Fed's portfolio, temporary operations through repurchase agreements, and discount window loans.2 It seems to me that the same three operations, though perhaps in different proportions, could be used in the absence of Treasury securities.",2001-10-12
Such transactions would not change the currency composition of the SOMA portfolio and would be less likely to affect exchange rates or the price of such debt.,2001-10-12
"On the other hand, these were unusual experiences in which the demand for financing from the Federal Reserve was boosted by private-sector caution and difficulties.",2001-10-12
"However, making significant use of this option would bias credit flows in the direction of depository institutions and, if the volume of these loans were large enough, could affect the interest rates on the assets, specifically bank loans held by such institutions.",2001-10-12
I start from the perspective that there are three different drivers of reserve injection and withdrawal in the implementation of monetary policy.,2001-10-12
The first driver is the long-term increase in the demand for currency and reserves.,2001-10-12
"The second is intermediate-term need for reserve expansion and contraction, arising, for example, from seasonal changes in the demand for currency and reserves.",2001-10-12
One portfolio might be focused on providing for the gradual long-term increase in the demand for currency and reserves.,2001-10-12
Long-term secular increases in the demand for currency or the demand for reserves could be met by outright purchases when the most important considerations would be neutrality and managing credit risk and when liquidity would be of less concern.,2001-10-12
I think that such demand could be well accommodated by a strategy of buying a slice of the same assets held by the private sector.,2001-10-12
Some occasions call for significant swings in currency or reserves because of seasonal demands for cash and loans.,2001-10-12
"In addition, in some periods the onset of financial stress may require a large increase in reserves to meet the demand for liquidity or the Fed may need to withdraw a large volume of reserves to offset increased discount window borrowing.",2001-10-12
Day-to-day shocks to the supply and demand for reserves must be offset to maintain the federal funds rate at its target level.,2001-10-12
This is particularly important when open market operations must be substantial enough to offset some other source of reserve creation--such as a large loan through the discount window or a large intervention in foreign exchange rates.,2001-10-12
"His views have had as much, if not more, impact on the way we think about monetary policy and many other important economic issues as those of any person in the last half of the twentieth century.",1997-09-05
"It has been argued, for example, that policy failed to anticipate the emerging inflation of the 1970s, and by fostering excessive monetary creation, contributed to the inflationary upsurge.",1997-09-05
"Surely, it was maintained, some monetary policy rule, however imperfect, would have delivered far superior performance.",1997-09-05
The monetary policy of the Federal Reserve has involved varying degrees of rule- and discretionary-based modes of operation over time.,1997-09-05
"In the late 1970s, the Federal Reserve's actions to deal with developing inflationary instabilities were shaped in part by the reality portrayed by Milton Friedman's analysis that ever-rising inflation rate peaks, as well as ever-rising inflation rate troughs, followed on the heels of similar patterns of average money growth.",1997-09-05
A considerable tightening of the average stance of policy--based on intermediate M1 targets tied to reserve operating objectives--eventually reversed the surge in inflation.,1997-09-05
The last fifteen years have been a period of consolidating the gains of the early 1980s and extending them to their logical end--the achievement of price stability.,1997-09-05
"Focussing on M1, and following operating procedures that imparted a considerable degree of automaticity to short-term interest rate movements, was extraordinarily useful in the early Volcker years.",1997-09-05
"But after nationwide NOW accounts were introduced, the demand for M1 in the judgment of the Federal Open Market Committee became too interest sensitive for that aggregate to be useful in implementing policy.",1997-09-05
"Because the velocity of such an aggregate varies substantially in response to small changes in interest rates, target ranges for M1 growth in its judgment no longer were reliable guides for outcomes in nominal spending and inflation.",1997-09-05
"In response to an unanticipated movement in spending and hence the quantity of money demanded, a small variation in interest rates would be sufficient to bring money back to path but not to correct the deviation in spending.",1997-09-05
"However, in recognition of the longer-run relationship of prices and M2, especially its stable long-term velocity, this broader aggregate was accorded more weight, along with a variety of other indicators, in setting our policy stance.",1997-09-05
"The apparent result was a significant rise in the velocity of M2, which was especially unusual given continuing declines in short-term market interest rates.",1997-09-05
Data since mid-1994 do seem to show the reemergence of a relationship of M2 with nominal income and short-term interest rates similar to that experienced during the three decades of the 1960s through the 1980s.,1997-09-05
"We recognize that, in fixing the short-term rate, we lose much of the information on the balance of money supply and demand that changing market rates afford, but for the moment we see no alternative.",1997-09-05
"In the current state of our knowledge, money demand has become too difficult to predict.",1997-09-05
"Although our operating target is a nominal short-term rate, we view its linkages to spending and prices as indirect and complex.",1997-09-05
"For another, spending, prices and other economic variables respond to a whole host of financial variables.",1997-09-05
"Nonetheless, we recognize that inflation is fundamentally a monetary phenomenon, and ultimately determined by the growth of the stock of money, not by nominal or real interest rates.",1997-09-05
"From a longer-term perspective we have been guided by a firm commitment to contain any forces that would undermine economic expansion and efficiency by raising inflation, and we have kept our focus firmly on the ultimate goal of achieving price stability.",1997-09-05
"Within that framework we have attempted not only to lean against the potential for an overheating economy, but also to cushion shortfalls in economic growth.",1997-09-05
"Unlike many uncertain situations that have confronted monetary policy, there was little question that the appropriate central bank action was to ease policy significantly.",1997-09-05
"Our concerns at that time reflected questions about how the financial markets and the economy would respond to the shock of a decline of more than one-fifth in stock prices in one day, and whether monetary policy alone could stabilize the system.",1997-09-05
Another development that confronted policy was the commercial property price bust of the late 1980s and early 1990s.,1997-09-05
"Since a large volume of bank and thrift loans was tied to the real estate market and backed by real estate collateral, the fall in property prices impaired the capital of a large number of depositories.",1997-09-05
The extraordinary circumstances dictated a highly unusual path for monetary policy.,1997-09-05
"By mid-1993, however, property prices stabilized and the credit crunch gradually began to dissipate.",1997-09-05
"It was clear as the year moved toward a close that monetary policy, characterized by a real federal funds rate of virtually zero, was now far too easy in light of the strengthening economy on the horizon.",1997-09-05
"Although it was difficult at that time to discern any overt inflationary signals, the balance of risks, in our judgment, clearly dictated preemptive action.",1997-09-05
"Even so, the idea of tightening to head off inflation before it was visible in the data was not universally applauded or perhaps understood.",1997-09-05
"Financial markets reacted unusually strongly to our 1994 policy actions, often ratcheting up their expectations for further rate increases when we actually tightened, resulting in very large increases in longer-term interest rates.",1997-09-05
"At the time, these reactions seemed to reflect the extent to which investment strategies had been counting on a persistence of low interest rates.",1997-09-05
We are always concerned about assuming that short-term movements in market prices are reflections of changes in underlying supply and demand conditions when we may be observing nothing more than fluctuating expectations about our own policy actions.,1997-09-05
"Most recently, the economy has demonstrated a remarkable confluence of robust growth, high resource utilization, and damped inflation.",1997-09-05
"Specifically, the persistence of rising profit margins in the face of stable or falling inflation raises the question of what is happening to productivity.",1997-09-05
"If data on profits and prices are even approximately accurate, total consolidated corporate unit costs have, of necessity, been materially contained.",1997-09-05
"With labor costs constituting three-fourths of costs, unless growth in compensation per hour is falling, which seems most unlikely from other information, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that output per hour has to be rising at a pace significantly in excess of the officially published annual growth rate of nonfarm productivity of one percent over recent quarters.",1997-09-05
"The degree to which these data may be understated is underlined by backing out from the total what appears to be a reasonably accurate, or at least consistent, measure of productivity of corporate businesses.",1997-09-05
The level of nonfarm noncorporate productivity implied by this exercise has been falling continuously since 1973 despite reasonable earnings margins for proprietorships and partnerships.,1997-09-05
"Presumably this reflects the significant upward bias in our measurement of service prices, which dominate our noncorporate sector.",1997-09-05
"Nonetheless, the still open question is whether productivity growth is in the process of picking up.",1997-09-05
"For it is the answer to this question that is material to the current debate between those who argue that the economy is entering a ""new era"" of greatly enhanced sustainable growth and unusually high levels of resource utilization, and those who do not.",1997-09-05
Supplying excess liquidity to support growth that turns out to have been ephemeral would undermine the very good economic performance we have enjoyed.,1997-09-05
"Whatever its successes, the current monetary policy regime is far from ideal.",1997-09-05
"Moreover, flows of U.S. currency abroad, which are variable and difficult to estimate, and bank reserves avoidance are subverting any relationship that might have existed between growth in the monetary base and U.S. economic performance.",1997-09-05
"Another type of rule using readings on output and prices to help guide monetary policy, such as John Taylor's, has attracted widening interest in recent years in the financial markets, the academic community, and at central banks.",1997-09-05
"They assume that central banks can appropriately pay attention simultaneously to developments in both output and inflation, provided their reactions occur in the context of a longer-run goal of price stability and that they recognize that activity is limited by the economy's sustainable potential.",1997-09-05
The mechanics of monetary policy that I have been addressing are merely means to an end.,1997-09-05
"The goal of macroeconomic policy should be maximum sustainable growth over the long term, and evidence has continued to accumulate around the world that price stability is a necessary condition for the achievement of that goal.",1997-09-05
Inflation impairs economic efficiency in part because people have difficulty separating movements in relative prices from movements in the general price level.,1997-09-05
But what prices matter?,1997-09-05
Certainly prices of goods and services now being produced--our basic measure of inflation--matter.,1997-09-05
"But what about prices of claims on future goods and services, like equities, real estate or other earning assets?",1997-09-05
Is stability in the average level of these prices essential to the stability of the economy?,1997-09-05
"The prices of final goods and services were stable in Japan in the mid-to-late 1980s, but soaring asset prices distorted resource allocation and ultimately undermined the performance of the macroeconomy.",1997-09-05
"In the United States, evaluating the effects on the economy of shifts in balance sheets and variations in asset prices have been an integral part of the development of monetary policy.",1997-09-05
And the equity market itself has been the subject of analysis as we attempt to assess the implications for financial and economic stability of the extraordinary rise in equity prices--a rise based apparently on continuing upward revisions in estimates of our corporations' already robust long-term earning prospects.,1997-09-05
"But, unless they are moving together, prices of assets and of goods and services cannot both be an objective of a particular monetary policy, which, after all, has one effective instrument--the short-term interest rate.",1997-09-05
We have chosen product prices as our primary focus on the grounds that stability in the average level of these prices is likely to be consistent with financial stability as well as maximum sustainable growth.,1997-09-05
"History, however, is somewhat ambiguous on the issue of whether central banks can safely ignore asset markets, except as they affect product prices.",1997-09-05
"Over the coming decades, moreover, what constitutes product price and, hence, price stability will itself become harder to measure.",1997-09-05
"When industrial product was the centerpiece of the economy during the first two-thirds of this century, our overall price indexes served us well.",1997-09-05
"The price of a ton of cold rolled steel sheet, or a linear yard of cotton broad woven fabrics, could be reasonably compared over a period of years.",1997-09-05
"I have already noted the problems in defining price and output and, hence, in measuring productivity over the past twenty years.",1997-09-05
The simple notion of price has turned decidedly complex.,1997-09-05
What is the price of a unit of software or of a medical procedure?,1997-09-05
How does one evaluate the price change of a cataract operation over a ten-year period when the nature of the procedure and its impact on the patient has been altered so radically?,1997-09-05
"Indeed, how will we measure inflation in the future when our data--using current techniques--could become increasingly less adequate to trace price trends over time?",1997-09-05
"Hence, we must assume that embodied in all products is some unit of output, and hence of price, that is recognizable to producers and consumers and upon which they will base their decisions.",1997-09-05
The emergence of inflation-indexed bonds does not solve the problem of pinning down an economically meaningful measure of the general price level.,1997-09-05
"While there is, of course, an inflation expectation premium embodied in all nominal interest rates, it is fundamentally unobservable.",1997-09-05
"Returns on indexed bonds are tied to forecasts of specific published price indexes, which may or may not reflect the market's judgment of the future purchasing power of money.",1997-09-05
"To the extent they do not, of course, the implicit real interest rate is biased in the opposite direction.",1997-09-05
"Doubtless, we will develop new techniques of measurement to unearth those true prices as the years go on.",1997-09-05
"It is crucial that we do, for inflation can destabilize an economy even if faulty price indexes fail to reveal it.",1997-09-05
It should be evident from my remarks that ample challenges will continue to face monetary policy.,1997-09-05
"And I'm pleased to have the opportunity to share with you, the students of South Dakota State University (SDSU), my experience as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and my outlook for the U.S. economy.1 Today I will speak to you about my outlook for the U.S. economy and what the Federal Reserve has been doing to support economic activity during the COVID-19 pandemic recovery.",2021-10-13
"As students of economics, you may already know that the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy to support a strong and stable economy in the United States.",2021-10-13

"May 13, 2021 The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Governor Christopher J. Waller At The Global Interdependence Center's 39th Annual Monetary and Trade Conference, The LeBow College of Business, Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (via webcast) Share Watch Live Thank you, Kathleen, and thank you, George and the Global Interdependence Center, for the invitation to speak to you this afternoon.",2021-05-13
I am with you to talk about my outlook for the U.S. economy and the implications for monetary policy.1 In the last week we have received employment and inflation reports that have garnered a lot of attention.,2021-05-13
"Let's remember, and this applies to latest inflation data too, that a month does not make a trendâ€”the trend for the economy is excellent.",2021-05-13
"My second message is that, despite the unexpectedly high CPI inflation report yesterday, the factors putting upward pressure on inflation are temporary, and an accommodative monetary policy continues to have an important role to play in supporting the recovery.",2021-05-13
The pandemic and resulting public health response led to the sharpest drop in employment and output the United States has likely ever experiencedâ€”22 million jobs lost in eight weeks and an annualized decline of 30 percent in real gross domestic output for the second quarter of 2020.,2021-05-13
"But thanks to the rapid development of vaccines and aggressive fiscal and monetary policy, the economy is recovering much faster than anyone expected six months ago.",2021-05-13
"The initial estimate of first quarter real gross domestic product (GDP) growth came in at a 6.4 percent annual rate, surpassing the level of output in the first quarter of 2020, before the full force of COVID-19 hit the economy.",2021-05-13
"Second-quarter growth is likely to be as much as 8 percent, and the prospects are good that GDP will be close to trend output by the end of 2021.",2021-05-13
Surveys of purchasing managers point to continued solid growth in both manufacturing and business services.,2021-05-13
"Employment, as I said, is still below where it was in February 2020, by 8 million jobs.",2021-05-13
"The unemployment rate is still 2.5 percentage points higher than it was in February 2020, and we know that it is even worse for some groupsâ€”nearly 10 percent for Black workers and nearly 8 percent for Hispanics.",2021-05-13
The employment-to-population ratio continues to be depressed from February 2020.,2021-05-13
"This chart, like the disappointing jobs report for April, shines a light on a current puzzle characterizing the U.S. labor marketâ€”a lot of job openings, but high unemployment rates and a low labor force participation rate.",2021-05-13
"When the pandemic hit, both labor demand and labor supply fell dramatically.",2021-05-13
The combination of widespread vaccines and fiscal and monetary stimulus caused consumer demand to recover sharply.,2021-05-13
"This situation, in turn, caused labor demand to rebound quickly, particularly in goods-producing industries.",2021-05-13
"However, due to factors like continued fears of the virus, the enhanced unemployment insurance, child-care issues, and early retirements, labor supply has not rebounded in the same fashion, which led to a situation with excess demand for labor and upward pressure on wages.4 And that is exactly what we saw in the April jobs report.",2021-05-13
"Finally, the enhanced unemployment benefits passed in response to the pandemic expire in September, and research has shown repeatedly that the job-finding rate spikes as unemployment benefits run out.5 Thus, while labor demand is currently outrunning labor supply, supply should catch up soon.",2021-05-13
"Now let me turn to the other leg of the Fed's dual mandate, price stability.",2021-05-13
"It was a surprise, but a look at its causes doesn't alter my fundamental outlook, which is that the main pressures on inflation are temporary.",2021-05-13
"First, let me address concerns that strong growth threatens to unleash an undesired escalation in inflation.",2021-05-13
"In August 2020, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) adopted a new policy framework that includes flexible average inflation targeting and a policy stance based on economic outcomes as opposed to economic forecasts.",2021-05-13
Flexible average inflation targeting means we aim to have inflation overshoot our 2 percent longer-run goal if inflation had been running persistently below target.,2021-05-13
"Given that we missed our inflation target on the low side consistently for the past eight years or so, the FOMC has said that it will aim to moderately overshoot its inflation target for some period but then have it return to target.",2021-05-13
Our willingness to aim for above-target inflation also means we will not overreact to temporary overshoots of inflationâ€”we need to see inflation overshoot our target for some time before we will react.,2021-05-13
An outcomes-based policy stance means that we must see inflation before we adjust policyâ€”we will not adjust based on forecasts of unacceptably high inflation as we did in the past.,2021-05-13
"Call this the ""Doubting Thomas"" approach to monetary policyâ€”we will believe it when we see it.",2021-05-13
"We asked to see it, and lo and behold, we are now starting to see inflation exceeding our inflation target.",2021-05-13
"Although inflation is starting to exceed our 2 percent target, in my view, this development is largely due to a set of transitory factors that are occurring all at once.",2021-05-13
"First, there is what we economists call ""base effects,"" which is the simple arithmetic of what happens when the very low inflation readings of the first half of 2020 fall out of our 12-month measure of inflation.",2021-05-13
"A second temporary factor is higher energy prices, which have rebounded this year as the economy strengthens but are expected to level off later this year.",2021-05-13
"Retail gasoline prices have jumped in some areas due to the disruption of the Colonial Pipeline, but the effect on inflation should be temporary also.",2021-05-13
"Stimulus checks put money in people's pockets, and when they spend it, there will be upward pressure on prices.",2021-05-13
"But when the checks are gone, the upward pressure on prices will ease.",2021-05-13
"As households draw down these savings, demand for goods and services will increase, which again will put upward pressure on prices.",2021-05-13
"But, just like stimulus checks, once the excess savings is gone, it is gone, and any price pressures from this factor will ease.",2021-05-13
"A fifth factor is supply bottlenecks that manufacturers and importers are currently experiencing; supply chain constraints are boosting prices, particularly for goodsâ€”less so for services.",2021-05-13
"If demand and prices rise for a product, supply will follow, and bottlenecks will dissipate.",2021-05-13
"So once again, price pressures induced by bottlenecks should reverse as supply chains catch up and orders get filled.",2021-05-13
"Finally, the excess demand for labor I described earlier is likely to continue to push wages up in the next couple of months.",2021-05-13
"How much of this increase gets passed through to prices is unknown, but some of it will.",2021-05-13
I expect that all of these factors will cause inflation to overshoot our 2 percent longer-run goal in 2021.,2021-05-13
"But they will not lead to sustained, high rates of inflation.",2021-05-13
"Financial markets seem to think the sameâ€”5-year breakeven inflation expectations are around 2.5 percent, and 5-year, 5-year-forward measures are around 2 percent, when adjusted for the difference between CPI (consumer price index) and PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation rates.6 Hence, markets do not believe the current factors pushing up inflation will last for long.",2021-05-13
"While I fully expect the price pressure associated with these factors to ease and for some of the large increases in prices to reverse, it may take a while to do so.",2021-05-13
"There are also asymmetric price effects from cost shocksâ€”prices go up very quickly but often tend to come down more slowly, as consumers slowly learn that the bottlenecks have gone away.",2021-05-13
"For these reasons, I expect that inflation will exceed 2 percent this year and next year.",2021-05-13
"And in my view, this fluctuation is okayâ€”our new framework is designed to tolerate a moderate overshoot of inflation for some time as long as longer-term inflation expectations remain well-anchored at 2 percent.",2021-05-13
"Before I turn to the implications of all this for monetary policy, a word about the housing market.",2021-05-13
"As I said earlier, housing is a bright spot in the economy that is encouraging investment and lifting household wealth, which is all good, but with memories of recent history in mind, the fast growth in housing prices in most areas of the United States does bear close watching.",2021-05-13
"Housing is becoming less affordable, and that price increase has the biggest effect on low-income individuals and families who have struggled the most since last spring and who are always the most vulnerable to rising rents and home prices.",2021-05-13
"Prices for lumber and other inputs for housing are skyrocketing, and while that occurrence is not having a significant effect on inflation, it is limiting the supply of new homes and helping feed the house price boom.",2021-05-13
Inflation is currently being driven above our 2 percent inflation target but is expected to return to target in subsequent years as transitory inflation shocks fade.,2021-05-13
"Highly accommodative monetary policy, in conjunction with unprecedented fiscal support, has supported a rapid recovery from a uniquely sharp, pandemic-caused recession.",2021-05-13
We also need to see if the unusually high price pressures we saw in the April CPI report will persist in the months ahead.,2021-05-13
"As a consequence, the conduct of monetary policy in the United States at its core involves crucial elements of risk management, a process that requires an understanding of the many sources of risk and uncertainty that policymakers face and the quantifying of those risks when possible.",2003-08-29
"It also entails devising, in light of those risks, a strategy for policy directed at maximizing the probabilities of achieving over time our goal of price stability and the maximum sustainable economic growth that we associate with it.",2003-08-29
"Because an interest rate, by definition, is the exchange rate for money against non-monies, money obviously is central to monetary policy.",2003-08-29
"However, in the past two decades, what constitutes money has been obscured by the introduction of technologies that have facilitated the proliferation of financial products and have altered the empirical relationship between economic activity and what we define as money, and in doing so has inhibited the keying of monetary policy to the control of the measured money stock.1 Another example of ongoing structural change relates to innovations in mortgage finance.",2003-08-29
"This includes the elimination of Regulation Q, the emergence of variable rate loans, the growth of the mortgage-backed securities market, and improvements in the efficiency of the credit application process.",2003-08-29
These developments appear to have buffered activity in the housing market to some extent from shifts in monetary policy.,2003-08-29
"For example, households have been able with increasing ease to extract equity from their homes, and this doubtless has helped support consumer spending in recent years, complementing the traditional effects of monetary policy.",2003-08-29
* * * What then are the implications of this largely irreducible uncertainty for the conduct of monetary policy?,2003-08-29
The cost--or premium--of the financial-contagion insurance was the associated increase in the risk of higher inflation at some future date.,2003-08-29
"This cost was viewed as relatively low at the time, largely because increased competition, driven by globalization, thwarted employers' ability to pass through higher labor costs into prices.",2003-08-29
"Such a cost-benefit analysis is an ongoing part of monetary policy decisionmaking, and tips more toward monetary ease when the fallout from a contractionary event such as the Russian default seems increasingly likely and its occurrence seems especially costly.",2003-08-29
"Conversely, in 1979, with inflation threatening to get out of control, the cost to the economy of a major withdrawal of liquidity was judged far less than the potential long-term consequences of leaving accelerating prices unaddressed.",2003-08-29
"For example, inference of how market participants might respond to a monetary policy initiative may need to reference past behavior during a period only roughly comparable to the current situation.",2003-08-29
"Were we to introduce an interest rate rule, how would we judge the meaning of a rule that posits a rate far above or below the current rate?",2003-08-29
"Partly for these reasons, the prescriptions of formal interest rate rules are best viewed only as helpful adjuncts to policy, as indeed many proponents of policy rules have suggested.",2003-08-29
"* * * In summary then, monetary policy based on risk management appears to be the most useful regime by which to conduct policy.",2003-08-29
"The continuity of this flow helps keep adverse selection and moral hazard in check and is crucial to the process of price discovery--that is, the ability of markets to collect information and properly evaluate the worth of financial assets.",2007-11-05
"During periods of financial distress, information flows may be disrupted, and price discovery may be impaired.",2007-11-05
"Because economic downturns typically result in even greater uncertainty about asset values, such episodes may involve an adverse feedback loop whereby financial disruptions cause investment and consumer spending to decline, which, in turn, causes economic activity to contract.",2007-11-05
"In turn, this development causes economic activity to contract further in a perverse cycle.",2007-11-05
"Historical examples of such shocks include higher interest rates, problems in the banking sector, increases in uncertainty, and asset market effects on balance sheets.",2007-11-05
"In the housing market, where price appreciation has slowed or even turned to depreciation in many areas, delinquencies and defaults have risen of late, especially in the variable-rate subprime sector.",2007-11-05
"In addition, the decline in house prices has induced a clear deterioration in the collateral behind home mortgages.",2007-11-05
"Rather, the Congress was concerned that financial panics were often followed by sharp contractions in economic activity, and it recognized that a stabilization of the financial system would lead to a stabilization of the whole U.S. economy.",2007-11-05
"Accordingly, it stated that ""the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee shall maintain long run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economy's long run potential to increase production, so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.""",2007-11-05
"Because long-term interest rates can remain low only in a stable macroeconomic environment, these goals are often referred to as the dual mandate--that is, the Federal Reserve seeks to promote the two coequal objectives of maximum employment and price stability.",2007-11-05
"Conversely, financial instability can compromise economic growth and price stability.",2007-11-05
"Today, I will instead focus on how monetary policy can be used as an effective instrument to keep markets stable and to counter the macroeconomic effects of a system that has become unstable.",2007-11-05
"As a general principle, a sound monetary policy is one that will foster the objectives of price stability and maximum sustainable employment.",2007-11-05
"For example, in an economy that experiences severe swings in output growth, lenders will be more reluctant to lend and will demand higher interest rates because of the higher risks that borrowers will default.",2007-11-05
"But this situation is likely to exacerbate the adverse selection problem, as only riskier borrowers will be willing to take out loans at higher interest rates.",2007-11-05
"Similarly, in an environment of high inflation, lenders will not be willing to lend for long periods.",2007-11-05
"Financial instability, however, can arise even if macroeconomic fundamentals are good and monetary policy is sound, simply because of shocks that are unforeseen by policymakers or that cannot be prevented from occurring.",2007-11-05
"In this case, monetary policy can also be useful because it can help forestall the negative macroeconomic consequences of financial instability.",2007-11-05
"An easier monetary policy provides a direct stimulus to the economy, as it generally leads to lower interest rates across the term structure.",2007-11-05
"They also generally boost asset prices, thereby increasing wealth and encouraging consumer spending.",2007-11-05
Researchers have also identified other channels through which monetary policy is effective.,2007-11-05
"The credit-channel view holds that monetary policy has additional effects because interest rate decisions influence the cost and availability of credit by more than would be implied by the associated movement in risk-free interest rates (Bernanke and Gertler, 1995; Bernanke, 2007a).",2007-11-05
"For example, an easier monetary policy strengthens the balance sheets of borrowers.",2007-11-05
"In addition to having beneficial macroeconomic effects, monetary policy can also help directly restore stability in financial markets after a period of financial instability.",2007-11-05
Monetary policy can contribute to this process by minimizing market uncertainty.,2007-11-05
"Monetary policy cannot have much influence on the former, but it can certainly address the latter--macroeconomic risk.",2007-11-05
"By cutting interest rates to offset the negative effects of financial turmoil on aggregate economic activity, monetary policy can reduce the likelihood that a financial disruption might set off an adverse feedback loop.",2007-11-05
The resulting reduction in uncertainty can then make it easier for the markets to collect the information that enables price discovery and to hasten the return to normal market functioning.,2007-11-05
"To achieve this result most effectively, monetary policy needs to be timely, decisive, and flexible.",2007-11-05
"However, because monetary policy makers can never be certain of the amount of policy easing that is needed to forestall the adverse effects of disruptions in financial markets, decisive policy actions may, from time to time, go too far and thus produce unwelcome inflationary pressures.",2007-11-05
That's why I said that flexibility is also an important characteristic of monetary policy during a time of financial turmoil.,2007-11-05
"If, in their quest to reduce macroeconomic risk, policymakers overshoot and ease policy too much, they need to be willing to expeditiously remove at least part of that ease before inflationary pressures become a threat.",2007-11-05
Some may see a monetary policy that actively addresses episodes of financial instability along the lines that I have just described as promoting excessive risk-taking and thus increasing the probability of future crises.,2007-11-05
"As I pointed out earlier, the Federal Reserve has a mandate from the Congress to promote maximum employment and stable prices, and it will choose its monetary policy actions so as to best meet that mandate.",2007-11-05
"And the fact that investors who misjudged the risks they were taking lost money over the past few months as well as during most other episodes of financial turmoil, independently of the monetary policy actions taken by the Federal Reserve, certainly corroborates this argument.",2007-11-05

"Indeed, monetary policy is and should be powerless in that respect.",2007-11-05
It is solely the responsibility of market participants to do the hard work of price discovery and to ascertain and manage the risks involved in their investments.,2007-11-05
"The Federal Reserve's Recent Monetary Policy DecisionsWhat I just said should serve as a framework for understanding the recent decisions of the Federal Reserve to ease policy, first by 50 basis points on September 18 and then by another 25 basis points last week.",2007-11-05
"Had the FOMC not eased policy, it would have faced a risk that the tightening of credit conditions and an intensifying housing correction would lead to significant broader weakness in output and employment.",2007-11-05
"The cut of 50 basis points at that meeting was the most prudent action from a macroeconomic standpoint, even given the Federal Reserve's objective of price stability.",2007-11-05
"Indeed, with economic growth likely to run below its potential for a while and with incoming inflation data to the favorable side, the easing of policy, even if substantial, seemed unlikely to affect adversely the outlook for inflation.",2007-11-05
The response of the markets to the easing of monetary policy in September was encouraging.,2007-11-05
"Indeed, the process of price discovery is ongoing, and it will likely be some time before it is completed.",2007-11-05
The combined 75 basis points of policy easing put in place at the past two meetings should help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and should help promote moderate growth over time.,2007-11-05
"But with an unchanged policy interest rate, I saw downside risks to the outlook for growth.",2007-11-05
"In voting to ease policy, I carefully considered the effect of that decision on our other objective--price stability.",2007-11-05
"I reasoned that the anticipated softening of economic growth and perhaps the emergence of some slack in the labor market might reduce those pressures, and I judged that a cut of 25 basis points in the target federal funds rate would not materially alter that modal outlook.",2007-11-05
"However, I recognized the risk that, even if readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year, recent increases in energy and commodity prices, among other factors, may put renewed upward pressure on inflation.",2007-11-05
"Consequently, in considering appropriate future adjustments to policy, I will monitor inflation developments carefully.",2007-11-05

"Finally, allow me to offer a few words about the FOMC's review of the monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices that we commenced in 2019.",2020-02-25

"Finally, I discuss the macroeconomic implications of productivity spurts, paying particular attention to their implications for monetary policy.",2001-02-20
Productivity Increases The growth of labor productivity is defined as the rate of growth of output less the rate of growth of labor input.,2001-02-20
"Because firms typically let their employment respond sluggishly to output changes, productivity growth rates have always been volatile, falling sharply when labor is hoarded and surging ahead as output recovers.",2001-02-20
"These spikes are quite evident in figure 1, which presents a historical series for labor productivity growth in the U.S. nonfarm business sector from 1960 to the present.",2001-02-20
"For most of the postwar period up to the early 1970s, U.S. labor productivity rose at the rate of about 3 percent per year.",2001-02-20
Then growth rates suddenly dropped to the level of about 1.5 percent per year.,2001-02-20
"But in the mid-1990s, just when everybody was getting used to low productivity growth, the growth in labor productivity picked up again.",2001-02-20
"There could, obviously, be many determinants of rates of productivity increase.",2001-02-20
"Given its definition, productivity growth could change with any factor that differentially affects output or labor growth, including the educational quality or demographic composition of the labor force.",2001-02-20
"Productivity growth could also be influenced by atmospheric variables such as the overall business climate, stable prices, global competition, or the presence or absence of costly environmental and safety regulations.",2001-02-20
"These factors are surely important and perhaps fundamental, but one can also look at productivity growth in a more technical way, using production functions.",2001-02-20
Explanations based on production functions try to distinguish between two components of productivity change.,2001-02-20
"One is what is known as capital-deepening productivity change, or the amount of labor productivity attributable to higher levels of capital per worker.",2001-02-20
"The other is what is known as multifactor productivity change (MFP), that occurring independently of supplies of capital and labor.",2001-02-20
"As every economics graduate student learns early, production functions can be differentiated to identify the two terms, with the capital-deepening term represented by the growth of capital per worker times capital's share of national income and MFP growth represented by the production function growth residual.",2001-02-20
"Since it is a residual, MFP growth could also reflect a great many other influences, including measurement biases.",2001-02-20
"And its rise has occurred with a fairly sharp drop in the average price of capital goods, so that the real investment share is clearly at a record high.",2001-02-20
"An increasing portion of this capital investment is in the form of computers and other high-tech investment, which, because of its high gross rate of return, has a particularly large impact on overall productivity.",2001-02-20
And a production function analysis would tend to attribute much of that recent gain in overall labor productivity to capital deepening.,2001-02-20
"Though capital-deepening productivity change may seem desirable, it is important to understand what it means in the long run.",2001-02-20
"As a nation's share of income devoted to capital increases, its capital per worker rises, and there is capital-deepening productivity change.",2001-02-20
"Capital per worker will, too, and the capital-deepening term will then no longer contribute to increases in the rate of productivity change.",2001-02-20
"Under most circumstances the nation will still be better off because the level of income per capita will be growing along a higher path, but rates of productivity change will no longer be increasing.",2001-02-20
Paul Krugman (2000) attributes some of Asia's recent economic difficulties to the fact that their earlier rates of productivity change were predominantly due to capital deepening and could not be sustained.,2001-02-20
"They find that, of the roughly 1 percentage point increase in labor productivity growth in the second half of the 1990s, capital-deepening from the information technology components together have accounted for about 0.5 percentage point of this increase.",2001-02-20
Oliner and Sichel's results run up to 1999--the recent even-more-rapid recent U.S. productivity gains are not included in their data.,2001-02-20
"As for electronic commerce, Oliner and Sichel do a back-of-the-envelope calculation on the importance of network effects arising from the Internet and find its present contributions to productivity growth to be small.",2001-02-20
"Oliner and Sichel analyze the MFP residual and find that its growth, too, is influenced by the productivity advances in the production of semiconductors and computers.",2001-02-20
They estimate that this component of MFP growth alone accounts for another 0.25 percentage point of the productivity increase.,2001-02-20
Technology and investment together could then account for as much as three-fourths of the recent productivity increase.,2001-02-20
"Dale Jorgenson and Kevin Stiroh (2000) use a slightly broader concept of output and find the growth contribution from high-tech investment to be slightly smaller, both before and after 1995.",2001-02-20
"Robert Gordon (2000) focuses on trend productivity growth, which in his model is smaller than actual productivity growth because of the sluggish response of labor demand to output growth.",2001-02-20
"After this adjustment, Gordon finds much less of a change in trend productivity growth outside the computer sector itself.",2001-02-20
Productivity change for this output concept has increased even more than for traditional concepts.,2001-02-20
"The Council of Economic Advisers (2001) finds a substantial pickup in productivity, both inside and outside the computer industry.",2001-02-20
"There is the difference between actual productivity growth (Oliner and Sichel), trend productivity growth (Gordon), and well-measured productivity growth (Nordhaus).",2001-02-20
"Given the difficulty in assigning productivity increases by industry, there is a dispute on how widely productivity implicit in the information revolution has spread across the economy.",2001-02-20
"Erik Brynjolfsson and Lorin Hitt (2000), and to some degree Nordhaus, make the argument that the productivity benefits of the information revolution are not captured in output statistics, leading to a downward bias in measured productivity.",2001-02-20
"Others make essentially the opposite point on the input side, arguing that many high-tech workers put in much longer hours than they used to, and are paid for, implying an upward bias in measured productivity.",2001-02-20
"At some point, it should be clearer how large the productivity shocks were, how much was cyclical and how much secular, how much was concentrated in particular industries, how much could reasonably be attributed to the boom in high-tech capital spending, how important electronic commerce will be, and how sustainable the growth spurt will be.",2001-02-20
"International Experience Because the electronic revolution is at least in some sense a worldwide phenomenon, one should be able to understand recent trends in U.S. productivity better by looking at the degree to which this productivity growth spurt has been shared around the world.",2001-02-20
These data are not as complete as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data used to analyze U.S. productivity change because they do not permit the detailed decomposition of the capital stock that Oliner and Sichel use for the United States.,2001-02-20
But Gust and Marquez do show that both sets of data give a similar-sized increase in productivity growth for the United States.,2001-02-20
"As the basic numbers from Gust and Marquez in exhibit 3 show, overall U.S. labor productivity growth jumped from 1.5 percent in the 1981-95 period to 2.6 percent in the post-1995 period in the BLS data and from 1.2 percent to 2.3 percent in the OECD data.",2001-02-20
"The increase in overall labor productivity growth between the periods is the same in both sets of data, and the increase in MFP growth is nearly the same.",2001-02-20
"Using the internationally comparable OECD data to compare rates of productivity change across countries, we see that in the 1981-95 period the United States had the lowest rate of overall productivity change of all thirteen countries.",2001-02-20
"The U.S. rate of 1.2 percent was slightly below that of Canada, Australia, and Sweden and far behind the rate of overall labor productivity improvement in all other countries.",2001-02-20
"In this recent period, the U.S. overall rate of labor productivity rose to third among the countries, behind only Ireland and Australia.",2001-02-20
"In terms of growth rate changes, the United States, Australia, and Sweden are the only countries in which overall labor productivity growth increased, and the United States and Australia are the only countries in which it increased very much.",2001-02-20
"In several countries--France, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Spain--overall labor productivity growth slowed quite sharply.",2001-02-20
"The decomposition given in exhibit 3 permits this comparison to be made by controlling for the level of investment and hence focusing directly on the more sustainable component of productivity change, MFP growth.",2001-02-20
"Since changes in the rate of labor productivity growth can be partly explained by capital deepening, the real question brought out by these comparisons is why MFP rates of change are actually falling in many European countries.",2001-02-20
"By showing that productivity growth is gradually slowing in most European countries, over fairly long periods of time, they strongly suggest that there is not a cyclical explanation for the international differences.",2001-02-20
"By showing that some countries using hedonic price indexes for high-tech capital have not had productivity increases, they suggest that different measurement conventions are not the answer.",2001-02-20
"The relative unimportance of measurement conventions is attributable to the fact that most foreign countries are not large producers of information technology equipment, suggesting that adjustment for quality in prices of these goods is likely to have little effect on their GDP growth.",2001-02-20
"Indeed, a separate study by Gavyn Davies, Ben Broadbent, and Tommaso Mancini-Griffoli (2000) finds that, for the Euro area, the use of the U.S. hedonic price indexes to recompute GDP has only a small quantitative effect on labor productivity growth.",2001-02-20
"These authors find that for Ireland, which produces a large share of high-tech products, the use of the U.S. hedonic prices would, however, have had a significant effect.",2001-02-20
There are other indications that the information technology revolution could explain the relatively good U.S. productivity performance.,2001-02-20
"As Oliner and Sichel find, the direct production of high-tech equipment can raise overall MFP growth if producers of these goods themselves are experiencing large efficiency gains.",2001-02-20
"Moreover, the use of information technology may also boost MFP growth on the demand side, as transactions costs are lowered or as businesses reorganize to take advantage of network effects arising from greater use of Internet-ready computers and electronic commerce.",2001-02-20
Overall investment seems to be important in raising productivity through the capital-deepening term.,2001-02-20
"Implications of Increases in Productivity Growth In the long run, the implications of increases in productivity growth rates are fairly obvious.",2001-02-20
Determining the implications of increases in productivity growth for inflation in the short- and medium-run is more complicated.,2001-02-20
Productivity gains are typically thought to reduce inflationary pressures by expanding aggregate supply relative to aggregate demand.,2001-02-20
"But such need not be the case, if the productivity gains sufficiently expand equity values and spending on consumption and investment.",2001-02-20
"If the impact of wealth on spending is large enough, productivity increases can actually expand aggregate demand more than supply in the short run, though presumably not in the longer run once the rise in income causes the wealth-income ratio to readjust.",2001-02-20
Increases in productivity growth can also influence inflationary pressures on the cost side.,2001-02-20
"Typically, wages are believed to lag productivity changes, so rises in productivity are reflected in near-term declines in unit labor costs, reducing inflationary pressures from the cost side.",2001-02-20
The way they catch up could depend on the pattern of productivity increases.,2001-02-20
There could be different types of productivity growth spurts.,2001-02-20
"Labor productivity could follow an S-shape pattern, with a positive second derivative of productivity followed by a negative second derivative.",2001-02-20
This pattern would occur in a typical neoclassical growth model following a movement toward greater capital deepening.,2001-02-20
"Or, productivity growth could jump to a new level, with no change in the second derivative of productivity in all periods other than the exact kink point.",2001-02-20
"Though such a pattern is not consistent with any known growth model, it does more closely approximate the actual historical pattern in the United States, where productivity growth suddenly dropped to a lower level for more than two decades.",2001-02-20
"In an S-shaped pattern, wages may initially lag productivity and then gradually catch up as productivity hits its phase of negative second derivatives.",2001-02-20
"In this event, productivity gains will at first create a decline in inflationary pressures and then a rise--exactly the reverse of the aggregate demand-aggregate supply balance discussed above.",2001-02-20
"In the kink pattern, wage growth may initially lag behind productivity change, but this decline in inflationary pressures would be followed by a movement back toward a neutral effect.",2001-02-20
Productivity gains may also have even more complicated influences.,2001-02-20
Both foreign and domestic investors may be tempted to invest in the new high productivity equipment.,2001-02-20
"As stated above, this new investment may boost aggregate demand, hence increasing inflationary pressures.",2001-02-20
"After a short interval, it will also boost the capital stock, generating further capital- deepening productivity change and a drop in inflationary pressures.",2001-02-20
"To the extent that the capital inflows come from abroad, productivity gains are also likely to generate currency appreciation, putting downward pressure on import prices and overall prices.",2001-02-20
"But the effect on capital equipment spending and foreign capital inflows should be temporary, and exchange rates, import prices, and domestic prices should all return to their previous paths.",2001-02-20
"Finally, in most growth models, changes in long-run productivity growth will also raise real interest rates, limiting investment demand but also simultaneously raising domestic currency values.",2001-02-20
"The balance between aggregate demand and supply is likely to be changing, cost pressures are likely to be changing, investment and the capital stock are likely to be changing, international exchange rates are likely to be changing, and real interest rates are likely to be changing.",2001-02-20
"My general answer to the policy quandary involves adapting a form of inflation targeting, a monetary policy strategy that has been successful and growing in popularity around the world.",2001-02-20
"In forward-looking, flexible inflation targeting (FFIT), a central bank would try to steer the economy toward some target rate of core inflation.",2001-02-20
"If inflation threatens to rise above the target, for whatever reason, the central bank would tighten policy to limit spending pressures that may lead to inflation.",2001-02-20
"Though not as well publicized, most actual inflation-targeting regimes are also two-sided.",2001-02-20
"This means that if recession threatens, actual inflation is likely to come in below the target level, inducing a central bank following FFIT to ease policy, limiting the recession and actually nudging inflation back up toward the specified inflation target.",2001-02-20
"In the U.S. context, such a central bank might use several proximate guides: The level of resource utilization and the balance between the growth of aggregate demand and aggregate supply seem clearly relevant to future inflation.",2001-02-20
"The central bank would have some estimate of the level and growth of aggregate supply, including any gains in productivity, and would compare this estimate with a forecast of the level and growth in aggregate demand, with the latter possibly generated by an econometric model.",2001-02-20
"If the rise in the wealth-income ratio, investment demands, exchange rates, or real interest rates influence spending demands, they would be factored in here.",2001-02-20
"Direct inflationary cost pressures also matter, and these should also be factored in.",2001-02-20
"Here is where unit labor costs, or specifically the relationship between productivity growth and wage increases, would come into play.",2001-02-20
"Here is also where the influence of commodity prices, energy prices, and exchange rates enter, though some of these factors would be temporary shocks and not indicators of true inflationary pressures.",2001-02-20
"At least in the United States, there are now a series of other forecasts that can be examined, from the Blue Chip indexes to longstanding surveys of the ways in which economists and average people are forecasting inflation.",2001-02-20
"The most direct of these data is the spread between nominal bonds of a standard maturity, say ten years, and real or inflation-indexed bonds.",2001-02-20
"This spread is sometimes affected by liquidity considerations, but in normal times it can be a good measure of the ten-year inflation foreseen by bond traders, a group that should be fairly sensitive to inflation.",2001-02-20
"A FFIT regime might have these four, or more, components in its targeting exercise, tightening policy when most of the components suggest that inflation is accelerating and easing policy if inflation appears to be quiescent and recession threatens.",2001-02-20
"A FFIT regime used in this way seems particularly well-adapted to episodes in which productivity changes, moving a number of variables in the inflation process in different directions, with different cycles.",2001-02-20
"Given lags in monetary policy, the central bank must move before the actual need for stimulus or restraint.",2001-02-20
"Conclusion The United States productivity growth spurt, realized to a much lesser extent around the world, can be attributed largely to a combination of an investment boom and a technological revolution.",2001-02-20
"The investment boom generates productivity gains through capital-deepening, and the technological revolution seems to raise MFP growth.",2001-02-20
The changes in productivity unleash all kinds of long- and short-run forces.,2001-02-20
"In the long- run the effects are surely positive, leading to greater growth in per capita living standards and a lessening of the long-run entitlement spending problem.",2001-02-20
"In the short-run, aggregate supply will rise, aggregate demand could rise, unit labor costs should fall, at least temporarily, and there could be further influences on investment, the capital stock, exchange rates, and real interest rates.",2001-02-20
"Forward-looking, flexible inflation targeting can forecast future pressures in either an inflationary or recessionary direction, and it is at least a feasible way for the central bank to respond to this multiple-variable complexity.",2001-02-20

The unemployment rate fell from over 7-1/2 percent in the middle of 1992 to just under 4 percent by the end of 2000.,2003-05-22
"In Minnesota, the unemployment rate fell from 5.2 percent to 3.4 percent over the same period.",2003-05-22
"The stock market soared, and--remarkably enough--core inflation moderated.",2003-05-22
Much of this performance was fueled by an investment boom that also contributed importantly to rapid growth in labor productivity.,2003-05-22
"To be sure, some of the acceleration in productivity over that period was cyclical in nature; but more critical for our longer-run economic performance is that at least a portion of the pickup now appears sustainable.",2003-05-22
"Many businesses were cutting back sharply on capital investment--particularly in high-tech equipment--as demand and profits weakened and many companies, such as those in the telecommunications industry, found that they had overspent on equipment during the boom.",2003-05-22
"Consumer spending and residential investment were both relatively well maintained throughout 2001, even as firms cut employment and stock market losses eroded household wealth.",2003-05-22
"Despite only modest increases in nominal wages and salaries, households' real disposable income was supported by tax cuts and lower inflation.",2003-05-22
"In addition, low interest rates helped promote spending.",2003-05-22
"Businesses seemed to have brought their inventories into better alignment with sales, and employment began to rise again, though the gains were too small to make a dent in the unemployment rate.",2003-05-22
"A particularly encouraging development, given the nature of the downturn, was that the contraction in business investment appeared to be slowing while household spending, still supported by low interest rates and gains in real disposable income, continued to trend up.",2003-05-22
"By the final quarter of 2002, real GDP growth had slowed to a pace of 1-1/2 percent, and heightened caution in the business sector showed through to renewed layoffs and a sharp cutback in inventory investment.",2003-05-22
"That brief review brings us to this year, which began with a few bright spots: Concerns about corporate governance were apparently receding, employment and industrial production moved up solidly in January, and the unemployment rate edged down a bit.",2003-05-22
"Oil prices rose to nearly $40 per barrel in early March, though civil strife in Venezuela undoubtedly played a role in the increase.",2003-05-22
Oil prices fell sharply during the week that ended with coalition missile attacks on Baghdad.,2003-05-22
"The price of crude oil has returned to levels that prevailed at the end of last year, and both households and businesses should welcome the lower energy bills.",2003-05-22
Other positive signs include further reductions in mortgage interest rates and the rebound in consumer confidence.,2003-05-22
"Though markets can respond instantly to positive news, business investment decisions adjust more slowly, and that distinction is evident in current production and employment data.",2003-05-22
"Businesses cut another 80,000 jobs in April, the jobless rate moved up to 6 percent, and new claims for unemployment insurance in recent weeks remain at levels associated with little net change in jobs.",2003-05-22
"(In Minnesota, the jobless rate moved up to 4.4 percent in March, and about 28,000 workers filed claims for unemployment compensation in April.)",2003-05-22
"Turning briefly to inflation, last week's report on the consumer price index showed, as expected, that consumer energy prices had begun to retreat noticeably last month, reversing about one-third of the run-up over the first three months of the year.",2003-05-22
"In April, prices of core goods and services--that is, consumer prices excluding food and energy--were unchanged for a second month.",2003-05-22
"On balance, these indicators suggest that the economy will probably remain soft in the near future and that inflation will remain low.",2003-05-22
"Nonetheless, I continue to believe that the pieces are in place for future robust growth.",2003-05-22
"For much of the period since mid-2001, large negative wealth effects from the falling stock market, the shakeout in the high-tech sector, and the slowdown in economic activity abroad have combined to restrain economic activity.",2003-05-22
"Looking forward, one must ask, what will lead to economic growth?",2003-05-22
The best way to start answering that question is to look at the fundamental forces shaping economic activity.,2003-05-22
"In that regard, a first consideration is that financial conditions should prove conducive to stronger economic growth over the next year or so.",2003-05-22
Monetary policy is very accommodative.,2003-05-22
"The nominal federal funds rate is currently 1-1/4 percent, a level that, using standard measures of core consumer price inflation, implies a real funds rate that is at or below zero, as compared with the real rate's long-run average of about 2-3/4 percent.",2003-05-22
"Business financing needs have been very limited recently, and demand for credit has been weak.",2003-05-22
"But the financial sector is well capitalized and under little stress, and lenders should be well positioned to fund a pickup in business demand for credit.",2003-05-22
"In addition, as I noted earlier, equity prices have moved up again.",2003-05-22
"Fiscal policy, like monetary policy, has been providing fundamental stimulus to economic growth over the past two years, through both tax cuts and higher outlays for defense.",2003-05-22
A third factor underpinning longer-run prospects for growth is the sustained strong uptrend in labor productivity.,2003-05-22
"Labor productivity rose 2 percent in 2001, a remarkable showing for a recession year, and it was up an additional 4 percent in 2002.",2003-05-22
"Productivity appears to have a strong underlying trend, which could support overall income growth even if the weakness in the labor market continues for a while longer.",2003-05-22
"In assessing how these factors will play out over time, I find it useful to consider separately how they translate into a pickup in demand among households and among businesses.",2003-05-22
"From the perspective of households, the combination of lower energy prices and tax cuts should help bolster real disposable income in the near term.",2003-05-22
"Low interest rates should allow consumers to continue to finance their purchases relatively cheaply, whether through home equity loans or through more standard instruments.",2003-05-22
"In the near term, lower oil prices should reduce the costs of production for many businesses and free funds for other uses.",2003-05-22
"Also, with interest rates low, the incentives for capital expenditure in the tax code in place until late 2004, and prices for high-tech goods still falling, the cost of capital should remain low.",2003-05-22
"Overall, though shifts in business attitudes are difficult to measure, I believe that markets reward businesses that outperform their competitors and that, as demand picks up, companies will respond to opportunities to incorporate technological advances in production, communication, and organization.",2003-05-22
Another question that is frequently asked is whether financial stress in the household sector might restrain growth.,2003-05-22
"To date, however, we have no evidence that the new disease has affected U.S. economic activity.",2003-05-22
"Nonetheless, continued slow growth abroad could have a damping effect on our recovery here.",2003-05-22
"It thus seems possible that monetary policy could be affected for some time by uncertainty surrounding fiscal policy and its effects on the economy.1 Macroeconomic Outcomes Are Difficult to Predict Before I turn to the possible effects of fiscal policy, it is helpful to remind ourselves of the immense uncertainty that accompanies any attempt to forecast future economic developments.",2017-01-17
"Many possible surprises could materially affect the future path of the U.S. economy, such as shocks to the price of oil, the foreign economic outlook, the rate of productivity growth, the sentiment of households and businesses, financial stability, and fiscal policy, to name a few.",2017-01-17
"The resulting uncertainty makes it difficult to predict the future path of activity, unemployment, and inflation.",2017-01-17
"By statute, the Federal Reserve is mandated to conduct monetary policy to promote the long run goals of maximum employment and stable prices.",2017-01-17
"In today's framework, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has defined stable prices to mean 2 percent inflation.",2017-01-17
Uncertainty about future employment and inflation naturally translates into uncertainty about the path of future monetary policy.,2017-01-17
"One useful measure of uncertainty is the magnitude of forecast errors, or the extent to which macroeconomic outcomes have differed from professional economic forecasters' expectations.2 Over the past 30 years, outside forecasts of the unemployment rate four quarters ahead have missed the actual unemployment rate by more than 3/4 percentage point in either direction one-third of the time.",2017-01-17
"Since notable departures from forecast values of unemployment and inflation occur with some frequency, it should not be surprising that the associated forecasts of interest rates have a similar track record.",2017-01-17
"One-third of the time over the past 30 years, outside forecasts of the level of short-term interest rates four quarters ahead have been above or below the actual level by more than 1-1/4 percentage points.3 Thus, it is important to keep in mind that all macro forecasts and projections of monetary policy are subject to considerable uncertainty, as they are based on information at a point in time, and actual developments could well evolve much differently.",2017-01-17
"Fiscal Policy Considerations Among the many factors that can affect the aggregate economy and, by extension, monetary policy, a possible shift in fiscal policy has attracted the attention of both economic forecasters and financial markets of late.",2017-01-17
"Among forecasters surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, for 2017, 44 percent indicated that they had raised their forecast of inflation and 47 percent had raised their forecast of gross domestic product (GDP) growth because of the recent U.S. election results, although on average forecast changes were modest.",2017-01-17
"Federal fiscal deficits, adjusted for the cyclical state of the economy, increased by roughly 2-1/2 percentage points of GDP from the period before the elections to six years following the elections, federal debt held by the public increased from about 25 percent of GDP to nearly 40 percent, and the current account deficit widened.4Following the 2000 elections, similar fiscal changes resulted in an increase in the fiscal deficit of close to 3 percentage points of GDP over the first six years of the new Administration on a cyclically adjusted basis.",2017-01-17
"Of course, there are important differences in today's conditions relative to these historical settings, including the economy's cyclical position, current and projected levels of indebtedness, the relative position of the global economy, and monetary policy settings.",2017-01-17
It is instructive to contemplate the important dimensions along which fiscal policy and its effects might vary as well as their implications for monetary policy.,2017-01-17
"In addition to the critical size and timing issues, there are four key dimensions: (1) the composition of policy changes and their relative effects on aggregate demand and aggregate supply, (2) the distance of the economy from full employment and 2 percent inflation, (3) the divergence in the cyclical position of the U.S. economy relative to foreign economies, and (4) the amount of fiscal policy space.",2017-01-17
Different types of policies can generate very different economic responses and have implications regarding both the amount of aggregate economic stimulus per fiscal dollar and also whether the effect is predominantly to raise aggregate demand or also to expand the supply potential of the economy.,2017-01-17
"Generally, fiscal stimulus that expands spending and investment directly or is targeted to households and businesses that have the greatest propensity to spend rather than save can be expected to generate the largest response in aggregate demand.5 Focusing first on policies that affect only aggregate demand, temporary demand-based fiscal expansions can speed recovery when the economy is some distance from full employment and target inflation, particularly if conventional monetary policy is constrained by the effective lower bound.",2017-01-17
"But when the economy is either close to or at full employment and inflation is converging to or at its target, additional fiscal demand will more likely result in inflationary pressures.",2017-01-17
"Thus, fiscal expansions that affect only aggregate demand and are enacted when the economy is near full employment and 2 percent inflation are relatively less likely to sustainably boost economic activity and relatively more likely to be accompanied by increases in interest rates.",2017-01-17
"The current nominal neutral interest rate--or the level of the federal funds rate that is consistent with output growing close to its potential rate with full employment and stable inflation--is quite low at present.6 Adjusting for inflation, most estimates of the neutral rate are currently close to zero, compared with about 2 percent for the quarter-century prior to the financial crisis.7 A low neutral rate implies that conventional monetary policy has less room to respond when the economy is hit by adverse shocks.",2017-01-17
"With conventional monetary policy constrained in the vicinity of the lower bound, it is more difficult for the economy to recover and for inflation to move back to target.8 Policies that persistently raise aggregate demand alone can lift the neutral rate, but that may come at substantial cost.",2017-01-17
"Because these policies do not affect the economy's long-term growth potential but do result in persistent fiscal deficits, they can lead to substantial increases in the debt-to-GDP ratio.",2017-01-17
The greater space for monetary policy to respond to adverse shocks provided by a higher neutral rate comes at the expense of reducing the space for fiscal policy to stabilize the economy in the event of future adverse shocks.,2017-01-17
"In this regard, it matters importantly whether increased fiscal deficits predominantly raise aggregate demand or also expand the supply potential of the economy more broadly.",2017-01-17
Changes in fiscal policy that raise the level or growth rate of productivity or that induce greater labor force participation and higher levels of skill and education in the workforce raise the nation's productive capacity and result in more sustainable increases in output and living standards.,2017-01-17
"The higher productivity and workforce levels engendered by these policies would likely increase investment opportunities and raise expectations of future income growth, sustainably boosting the levels of investment and consumption and, as a result, the longer-run neutral rate.",2017-01-17
"In recent years, major foreign economies have been contending with a deficiency of domestic demand.",2017-01-17
"At a time when the U.S. economy has made important progress on employment and inflation, in both Europe and Japan output or inflation, or both, remain well below desired levels.",2017-01-17
"Moreover, growth in many emerging market economies, including importantly China, has slowed in recent years, and financial conditions in some emerging economies appear fragile.",2017-01-17
"Against the backdrop of deficient demand abroad, if more expansionary fiscal policy here at home raises expectations of a growing divergence between the United States and other economies, upward pressure on the exchange rate will likely result, as we have seen recently with the renewed increase in the dollar.",2017-01-17
"The result could be cross-border spillovers from the increase in U.S. domestic demand, reducing the effect on U.S. real activity and inflation and potentially contributing to external imbalances.",2017-01-17
"In the past few years, the effect on the dollar of increased expectations about divergence between U.S. and foreign interest rates has been especially strong.9 The nearly 20 percent increase in the dollar over 2014 and 2015 coincided with falling real exports and import prices in the United States.",2017-01-17
"Net exports subtracted more than 1/2 percentage point from GDP growth in both 2014 and 2015, while falling non-oil import prices likely subtracted 1/4 percentage point from the annual rate of core inflation.10 Finally, the trajectory of federal government debt relative to GDP and views regarding the debt's sustainability can also influence the effects of fiscal policy.",2017-01-17
"Research suggests that increases in the debt-to-GDP ratio cause long-term interest rates to rise.11 All else being equal, higher long-term interest rates reduce spending on interest-sensitive goods, possibly damping the direct effect of fiscal expansion on economic activity.",2017-01-17
"The experiences of foreign economies suggest that the relationship between debt and interest rates is complex and likely non-linear, with the influence of greater debt on interest rates rising as the debt-to-GDP ratio reaches a trajectory at which investors have concerns about its sustainability.",2017-01-17
"In this light, it is notable that the current ratio of debt to GDP is substantially larger than it was preceding the fiscal expansions in the early 1980s and early 2000s and has already been projected to increase further based on demographic trends.12 Guideposts for Monetary Policy With any future change in fiscal policy quite uncertain, monetary policy will be guided by the current state of the economy, the underlying momentum of economic activity and inflation, the level of the neutral rate, and the balance of macroeconomic risks.",2017-01-17
"Following a year in which the unemployment rate remained stable while labor force participation increased, we have seen in the past quarter a further reduction in the unemployment rate.",2017-01-17
"Overall, I am pleased to see that full employment is within reach and could prove sustainable with the right policy mix.",2017-01-17
"Payroll growth has remained sufficiently strong to continue eroding slack, increasingly along margins that had previously seemed stubbornly elevated--including the long-term unemployed, those on the margins of the labor force, and most recently those who are working part time but would prefer full-time work.",2017-01-17
"Moreover, wage growth appears to be picking up gradually in a further sign that slack continues to be taken up.",2017-01-17
"While the employment cost index was up only 2.3 percent over the 12 months ending in September, still well below pre-crisis norms, average hourly earnings have accelerated more noticeably, increasing by 2.9 percent on a 12-month basis in December.",2017-01-17
"Even so, some slack may remain: Relative to pre-crisis levels, the prime-age employment-to-population ratio remains low and the share of employees working part time for economic reasons remains elevated.",2017-01-17
"Following a long period of stubbornly below-target inflation, I have been encouraged by recent signs of gradual progress toward our inflation target, as the effects of earlier dollar appreciation and oil price declines appear to be waning.",2017-01-17
"Over the 12-month period ending in November, core personal consumption expenditures prices increased 1.6 percent.",2017-01-17
"This rate is still noticeably below 2 percent, but it is up 1/4 percentage point from a year earlier.13 In addition, market measures of longer-run inflation compensation based on nominal and inflation-protected Treasury yields have improved about 40 basis points relative to the very depressed levels prevailing through much of the preceding year, although, even with this increase, inflation compensation remains well below historical norms.",2017-01-17
How quickly remaining slack is utilized and inflation returns to target depends on future growth in activity.,2017-01-17
"Meanwhile, changes in financial conditions have been somewhat offsetting since early November, with equity prices rising 7 percent, while 10-year Treasury yields are up 50 basis points, and the dollar is up 4 percent.",2017-01-17
"When the economy eventually returns to full employment and 2 percent inflation, the appropriate level of the federal funds rate will depend on the level of the neutral rate, which is expected to move up only modestly in coming years from its current low level.14On the one hand, if progress on employment and inflation occurs more quickly than I anticipate, foreign risks recede, and the fiscal impulse rises, the neutral rate might rise more rapidly.",2017-01-17
"With weak domestic demand abroad, further tightening of financial conditions through the exchange rate could lead to some spillover of demand across borders, weighing on U.S. exports, investment, and manufacturing activity and potentially constraining the neutral rate.",2017-01-17
"Finally, how strongly monetary policy should react to signs of further progress toward full employment and 2 percent inflation naturally depends on the balance of risks.",2017-01-17
"Given the recent improvement in unemployment and inflation and the possibility of increased fiscal stimulus, risks in the domestic economy are closer to being balanced than they have been for some time.",2017-01-17
"While great uncertainty regarding the path of fiscal policy and its economic effects will remain for some time, with the economy getting closer to full employment, the prospect of a material increase in fiscal stimulus over a sustained period could reasonably be expected to shift somewhat greater probability toward stronger inflation outcomes.",2017-01-17
"With a low U.S. neutral rate, conventional U.S. monetary policy does not have as much room as it did prior to the financial crisis to counter adverse shocks from abroad.",2017-01-17

"February 24, 2021 How Should We Think about Full Employment in the Federal Reserve's Dual Mandate?",2021-02-24
"So the one message I hope you remember from today is that economics provides powerful tools to enable you to analyze and affect the issues that matter most to you.1 With jobs down by 10 million relative to pre-pandemic levels, one issue that matters fundamentally to all of us is achieving full employment.",2021-02-24
So today I want to talk about both the Federal Reserve's responsibilities with regard to full employment and different approaches to assessing where we are relative to that goal.,2021-02-24
The belief that the federal government has a responsibility for full employment has its roots in the Great Depression.,2021-02-24
"It was given statutory expression at the end of the Second World War when policymakers and legislators feared that the millions of American soldiers returning to the labor market would face Depression-era conditions.2 In the Employment Act of 1946, the Congress directed the federal government as a whole to pursue ""conditions under which there will be afforded useful employment for those able, willing, and seeking work, and to promote maximum employment, production, and purchasing power.",2021-02-24
"""3 The postwar policy discussion raised important issues surrounding the definition and measurement of full employment.",2021-02-24
"In 1950, the Review of Economics and Statistics published a symposium titled ""How Much Unemployment?""",2021-02-24
which debated the accuracy of the Census Bureau's value for unemployment.4 Dr. Palmer was a critical contributor to the symposium.,2021-02-24
"Palmer was a professor at Wharton, a fellow of the American Statistical Association, a worldwide expert on manpower and labor mobility, and a consultant with the Office of Statistical Standards.5 She argued that ""a single figure of unemployment, regardless of how it is defined or derived, is inadequate as a basis for selection among [policy] programs.",2021-02-24
"""6 With concerns about employment again on the rise, in 1976, Senator Hubert Humphrey joined with Congressman Augustus Hawkins to sponsor legislation promoting full employment.7 An amendment to the Federal Reserve Act in 1977 specifically assigned monetary policy responsibility for promoting ""the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates,"" commonly referred to as the dual mandate.8 This amendment was followed by the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act, passed in 1978, requiring that the Federal Reserve regularly report to the Congress on how monetary policy was supporting the goals of the act.9 Congressman Hawkins was a prominent advocate of full employment, emphasizing its importance not only for providing a job to every American seeking work, but also for reducing poverty, inequality, discrimination, and crime and improving the quality of life of all people.10 A congressman from southern California, Hawkins was one of the founders of the Congressional Black Caucus and played a major role in the drafting of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.",2021-02-24
"He was also influenced by the work of economists such as Robert Browne and Bernard Anderson, which highlighted the persistent disparity between Black and white employment and the connection between elevated Black unemployment and economic challenges facing Black communities.11 Hawkins emphasized that ""without genuine full employment it would be impossible to eliminate racial discrimination in the provision of job opportunities.",2021-02-24
"""12 The Humphrey-Hawkins Act noted that ""increasing job opportunities and full employment would greatly contribute to the elimination of discrimination based upon sex, age, race, color, religion, national origin, handicap, or other improper factors.",2021-02-24
"""13 The centrality of achieving full employment for all Americans is as pressing today as it was in 1930, 1946, and 1977.",2021-02-24
"And the statutory dual mandate assigned to monetary policy has ensured an unwavering, strong focus on maximum employment as well as price stability at the Federal Reserve in research and measurement no less than policymaking.",2021-02-24
"The Federal Reserve recently concluded a review of our monetary policy framework, which included extensive outreach to a broad range of people over the course of 2019.",2021-02-24
"At a time when the national headline unemployment rate was at a multidecade low, community and labor representatives and educators noted ""it's always a recession"" in their communities.14 They challenged whether the overall economy could be characterized as at ""full employment"" while unemployment remained in the double digits in their communities.",2021-02-24
"Reflecting this input, and in light of persistently below-target inflation, low equilibrium interest rates, and low sensitivity of inflation to resource utilization, we made several important changes to the monetary policy framework.",2021-02-24
"Two changes have particular relevance for the employment leg of the dual mandate.15 The new framework calls for monetary policy to seek to eliminate shortfalls of employment from its maximum level, in contrast to the previous approach that called for policy to minimize deviations when employment is too high as well as too low.",2021-02-24
The new framework also defines the maximum level of employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal assessed through a wide range of indicators.,2021-02-24
So how should we assess this broad-based and inclusive concept of maximum employment?,2021-02-24
"When discussing aggregate indicators about the labor market, people tend to focus on the headline U-3 measure of the unemployment rate.16 Although the unemployment rate is a very informative aggregate indicator, it provides only one narrow measure of where the labor market is relative to maximum employment.",2021-02-24
"Recalling Gladys Palmer's dictum, I would not recommend relying on any single indicator, but rather consulting a variety of indicators that together provide a holistic picture of where we are relative to full employment.",2021-02-24
So let us start by seeing what insights we gain by disaggregating the unemployment data into different groups of workers.,2021-02-24
The unemployment rate has improved very rapidly from its peak of 14.8 percent last April to 6.3 percent today.,2021-02-24
"17 Disaggregating the overall unemployment rate reveals that workers in the lowest wage quartile face Depression-era rates of unemployment of around 23 percent.18 In part, this rate likely reflects the concentration of lower-wage jobs in service industries that are strongly reliant on in-person contact, or at least in-person work, while a larger proportion of higher-wage jobs are currently being performed remotely or with reduced levels of in-person contact.",2021-02-24
There is also important information in the disaggregation of unemployment by different racial and ethnic groups.,2021-02-24
"Figure 1 shows the prime-age unemployment rate overall and on a disaggregated basis.19 There are notable persistent gaps between different racial and ethnic groups, and the sizes of those gaps tend to vary over the business cycle.",2021-02-24
"For example, historically, the ratio of the Black unemployment rate to the white unemployment rate is around 2 for prime-age workers.",2021-02-24
"On average, a 1 percentage point increase in the white unemployment rate is accompanied by a 2 percentage point increase in the Black unemployment rate.",2021-02-24
"At the beginning of 2015, a time when many economists believed the overall unemployment rate had reached its ""normal"" rate, the gap between the Black and white prime-age unemployment rates stood just under 5 percentage points, roughly at its average level since 1972.",2021-02-24
"By September 2019, that gap had reached a historical minimum of 1.7 percentage points, and the gap between the Hispanic and white prime-age unemployment rates had fallen to 0.3 percentage point.",2021-02-24
The unemployment gaps between racial and ethnic groups widened again during the pandemic.,2021-02-24
"Currently, for prime-age individuals, the gaps between the white unemployment rate and the Black and Hispanic unemployment rates are roughly 4 percentage points and 3 percentage points, respectively.",2021-02-24
The unemployment rate obscures important information about people leaving and entering the workforce.,2021-02-24
"The unemployment rate is the number of individuals who are not currently working but are actively looking for a job, divided by the size of the labor force, which includes only those people who are either working or actively seeking work: $$ U = {Unemployed \over Labor Force}.$$ Changes in labor force participation contain important information about the strength of the labor market that is not captured in the unemployment rate.",2021-02-24
"The labor force participation rate (LFPR) is the number of individuals who are either working or are seeking work, divided by the working-age population: $$ LFPR = {Labor Force \over Population}.$$ When we take into consideration the more than 4 million workers who have left the labor force since the pandemic started, as well as misclassification, the unemployment rate is close to 10 percent currentlyâ€”much higher than the headline unemployment rate of 6.3 percentâ€”and similar to the peak unemployment rate following the financial crisis.",2021-02-24
"For mothers, the fraction who were out of the labor force for caregiving was 22.8 percent, an increase of 2.4 percentage points from a year earlier, while for fathers the fraction was 2.2 percent, an increase of about 0.6 percentage point.20 If not soon reversed, the decline in the participation rate for primeâ€‘age women could have longer-term implications for household incomes and potential growth.21 While there are long-term structural trends in participation, such as population aging, there are also cyclical dynamics that are important for our assessment of maximum employment.",2021-02-24
The two panels in figure 3 show prime-age unemployment and labor force participation over the previous recession and recovery.,2021-02-24
"Following the onset of the global financial crisis, as the number of unemployed people was rising, the size of the labor force was also contracting, pushing the numerator of the unemployment rate up and the denominator down.",2021-02-24
"When the unemployment rate started to decline at the end of 2010, this decline in part reflected unemployed people dropping out of the labor force through 2013.",2021-02-24
"The subsequent seemingly modest decline in the unemployment rate from 4.3 at the end of 2015 to 3 percent at the end of 2019 was much more significant, taking into account that more than 3-1/2 million prime-age workers joined or rejoined the labor force during that period.",2021-02-24
"This brings me to figure 4 and the employment-to-population (EPOP) ratio, which is the number of individuals employed divided by the working-age population: $$ EPOP = {Employed \over Population}.$$ The EPOP ratio synthesizes the information contained in the unemployment rate and LFPR.",2021-02-24
"For instance, as you can see in figure 4, a decline in participation almost entirely offset the decline in unemployment in 2010 and 2011, leaving the prime-age EPOP ratio essentially flat at 75 percent.",2021-02-24
"A glance back at figure 3 shows that the reductions in employment last spring were accompanied by many prime-age workers leaving the labor force, and the participation rate among prime-age workers has declined further since last May.",2021-02-24

"The part-time for economic reasons (PTER) indicator shown in figure 7 measures those who are working part time because they are unable to find a full-time job or whose hours have been reduced and who would prefer full-time employment.25 This indicator is an important measure of labor market slack, which tends to jump rapidly during recessions and improve more slowly than headline unemployment during recoveries.",2021-02-24
"PTER jumped during the financial crisis as workers who were unable to secure full-time employment moved to part-time work, accounting for more than half of the increase in involuntary part-time work during 2008.26 Today there are 6.0 million people working part time who would prefer full-time work, up 1.6 million relative to the pre-COVID level.",2021-02-24

"The incidence of involuntary part-time work was especially notable for Hispanic workers at the trough of the Great Recession, nearing 12 percent of employment and almost double its rate before the recession.",2021-02-24
"Research indicates that gaps in involuntary part-time employment rates remain for Blacks, as well as Hispanics, relative to whites after controlling for age, education, marital status, and state of residence, although education and occupation can explain a portion of the gap for Hispanics.28 Before concluding, I would like to point to two other labor market indicators that provide useful evidence of the extent of labor market slack.",2021-02-24
"The quits rate, shown in figure 9, is a measure of voluntary separations that provides information about how confident people are that they will be successful in finding a new job they prefer and, relatedly, of how aggressively firms are pursuing talent.29 Research indicates that the quits rate and wage growth are highly correlated, suggesting that these voluntary job-to-job transitions reflect individuals moving up a ""job ladder"" to higher-paying jobs.30 The quits rate fell rapidly during the 2008 recession as workers' options became more limited, then recovered slowly, only surpassing its preâ€“financial crisis level of roughly 2.5 percent in 2018.",2021-02-24

"For nearly four decades, monetary policy was guided by a strong presumption that accommodation should be reduced preemptively when the unemployment rate nears its normal rate in anticipation that high inflation would otherwise soon follow.",2021-02-24

My subject this afternoon will be inflation dynamics.,2007-03-12
"Since the mid-1980s, we have seen important improvements in these dynamics--inflation is now much lower and more stable than it once was, and it appears to be less closely correlated with movements in other economic factors than it was during the 1960s and 1970s (see table).",2007-03-12
"Questions of intense interest to many of you as well as to us at the Federal Reserve are, What caused these changes in the inflation process?",2007-03-12
and What are their implications for monetary policy?,2007-03-12
"Having spent many years as a University of Chicago professor, my first reaction to these changes is to think â€œmoney.â€ As Milton Friedman famously said many years ago, â€œInflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.â€ Unfortunately, given the lack of a stable relationship between money growth and inflation, the pure monetarist view has taken a beating since then.",2007-03-12
"However, Friedman was right that inflation is, ultimately, something that central banks determine, at least on average, over time.",2007-03-12
"Views about the inflation process vary, but expectations are at the heart of almost all of them.",2007-03-12
"And in any model in which expectations are important, monetary policy will also be important.",2007-03-12
"So monetary policy, if not money itself, remains a central determinant of inflation dynamics.",2007-03-12
"Accordingly, one of my principal themes today will be that expectations are important in the inflation process and that the improved conduct of monetary policy, by influencing the formation of expectations in a favorable manner, may account for many of the changes in inflation dynamics that we observe.",2007-03-12
"At the same time, I am wary of ascribing all of the changes in dynamics to monetary policy.",2007-03-12
"We should not place too much faith in any one framework, and so we need to keep an open mind about other possible explanations for the recent changes in inflation dynamics.",2007-03-12
"The Expectational Approach to Thinking about Inflation Now almost forty years old, the expectational approach to inflation dynamics--developed simultaneously by Friedman and recent Nobel prize winner Edmund Phelps--is still the dominant framework for thinking about inflation.",2007-03-12
Let me begin with a quick review of what Friedman and Phelps said forty years ago and then discuss very briefly how it relates to current thinking about the inflation process.,2007-03-12
"In Friedmanâ€™s framework as expressed in his 1967 presidential address to the American Economics Association, inflation is related to inflation expectations as well as the level of resource utilization.",2007-03-12
"Friedman explained that for a variety of real-world reasons, wages and prices might not always adjust immediately to changes in the money supply.",2007-03-12
"If they did not so adjust, monetary policy could affect resource utilization.",2007-03-12
"The reason that Friedmanâ€™s work, and that of Phelps, was so revolutionary was that it overturned the earlier belief that monetary policy could have a permanent influence on resource utilization in favor of a new view that monetary policy could affect real activity only temporarily.",2007-03-12
"In the early 1970s, Robert Lucas expanded on the ideas of Friedman and Phelps and noted that shifts in the way a central bank conducts monetary policy imply changes in the way the public forms its expectations.",2007-03-12
"Over the past thirty years, economists have taken these observations to heart in trying to explain the behavior of overall inflation.",2007-03-12
One standard approach starts with the notion that many wages and prices adjust only gradually to changes in costs and demand.,2007-03-12
"That assumption about the microeconomic behavior of price setters has recently been bolstered by some research that has looked at the data underlying the consumer price index to assess how often prices change (Bils and Klenow, 2004).",2007-03-12
"The research finds that, indeed, prices for many goods and services appear to adjust only gradually, with the typical firm changing the price of a typical item about once every four months.",2007-03-12
"When wages and prices adjust only infrequently, expectations are important, because firms and households must take into account the demand and supply conditions that will prevail until they again reset their prices.",2007-03-12
"All sorts of expectations will matter, but central among them are inflation expectations: If wages and prices in general are rising over time, then when firms have a chance to reset their prices, they will generally set them higher than they would if the overall price level was holding steady.",2007-03-12
"Because the new approaches to understanding inflation are grounded in the behavior of individual decisionmakers, they have the solid theoretical foundations that are valuable for policy analysis.1 Moreover, some evidence indicates that empirical models based on this research do fairly well at forecasting.",2007-03-12
"Of course, time will tell about their usefulness in the day-to-day operations of monetary policy.",2007-03-12
"Changes in Inflation Dynamics As I noted earlier, the inflation process seems to have changed in a number of ways in recent years, both in the United States and in other countries.",2007-03-12
I would like to review these changes and then consider what they may tell us about the underlying processes driving inflation.,2007-03-12
"One notable change is that movements in inflation now appear to tell us much less about future inflation than was the case, say, thirty years ago.",2007-03-12
"Here I am talking about predictions of inflation using only information on past inflation, without taking into account any other information.",2007-03-12
"The evidence suggests that, at the peak of U.S. inflation in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the best such â€œunivariateâ€ forecast of inflation--into the indefinite future--was a simple average of inflation over the past few quarters (Stock and Watson, 2007; Cecchetti and others, 2007).",2007-03-12
"In that period, sharp increases in inflation were reversed only slowly.",2007-03-12
"By contrast, shocks to inflation since roughly the mid-1980s have tended to be short-lived, so that the best forecast of future inflation would be a very long average of past inflation.",2007-03-12
"Thus, when inflation moves above its recent long-run average, most of the upswing will likely be quickly reversed, although this result is not guaranteed.",2007-03-12
Thatâ€™s a remarkable change in the behavior of inflation.,2007-03-12
"The international evidence indicates that the longevity of inflation shocks has been attenuated in many other countries as well (Cecchetti and others, 2007).",2007-03-12
"Moreover, the timing of the switch from largely permanent to mostly transitory movements in inflation is remarkably similar across the United States and these other countries.",2007-03-12
"Another apparent change in the inflation process has been a reduction in the correlation between inflation and unemployment (Atkeson and Ohanian, 2001; Roberts 2006).",2007-03-12
"Now, this relationship was always loose, as most of the historical variation in inflation has reflected influences aside from movements in unemployment or other measures of resource utilization.",2007-03-12
"Still, in the 1960s and 1970s, a reasonably strong empirical relationship between inflation and unemployment could be found for the United States, with inflation tending to rise in periods when unemployment was low and vice-versa.",2007-03-12
"In fact, some researchers now find no relationship at all, whereas others tend to find one that is of reduced economic importance.2 Again, similar shifts have been observed in other countries, and these results are not sensitive to whether we are looking at core inflation or total inflation (Borio and Filardo, 2006; Ihrig and others, forthcoming).",2007-03-12
Next on the list of changes is the influence of energy prices.,2007-03-12
"During the 1970s, fluctuations in energy prices appear to have had a significant influence on core inflation--that is, on the growth rate of consumer prices excluding food and energy.",2007-03-12
"But since the early 1980s, the inflationary effect of movements in prices for gasoline, natural gas, and other energy goods seems to have declined considerably, even after allowance is made for a secular decline in the energy intensity of the U.S. economy (Hooker, 1996).",2007-03-12
"Indeed, some estimates even suggest that energy price shocks have no effect whatsoever on core inflation.",2007-03-12
"From a cost-accounting perspective, estimates of a zero effect seem too improbable to be taken literally: Recent swings in energy input costs have been sufficiently large that they should have had a noticeable effect on the prices of other goods and services, even allowing for their relatively small share in overall costs.",2007-03-12
"I will return later to possible explanations for the sharp drop in the estimated effects of movements in energy prices.3 Finally, one of the most striking changes in the U.S. economy in recent decades has been the reduction in the economyâ€™s volatility.",2007-03-12
"The standard deviation of quarterly growth of real (that is, inflation adjusted) gross domestic product for the United States since the mid-1980s has been about half that experienced during the 1960s and 1970s.",2007-03-12
"The volatility of inflation has fallen to a similar degree; moreover, the reduction in volatility for both output and inflation is widespread across countries.",2007-03-12
"Of course, a smaller volatility of real GDP is not a change in inflation dynamics.",2007-03-12
"But if monetary policy has been an important factor behind the drop in the economyâ€™s volatility, then the expectational mechanisms may be very similar to those affecting inflation dynamics.4 Expectations, Monetary Policy, and Changing Inflation Dynamics As Lucas pointed out, because expectations matter for inflation, monetary policy matters for inflation, too.",2007-03-12
"And the historical record supports the notion that, starting with Chairman Paul Volcker, U.S. monetary policy has been more focused on low and stable inflation than was the case in the 1960s and 1970s (Romer and Romer, 2002).",2007-03-12
"So it is natural to ask, can changes in the conduct of monetary policy in the United States (and elsewhere) help to account for the changes weâ€™ve seen in inflation dynamics?",2007-03-12
The strongest case for a link between monetary policy and changes in inflation dynamics is in the greater stability of inflation.,2007-03-12
"Inflation is clearly under the long-run control of the Fed, and the relative stability of inflation clearly reflects the action of monetary policy.",2007-03-12
"Thus, if the central bank wants to keep inflation low on average over time, it can surely do so.",2007-03-12
The case for monetary policy contributing to reduced volatility of inflation is also fairly straightforward: The central bank can stabilize inflation by raising and lowering interest rates to lean against inflationary disturbances.,2007-03-12
"Once we take account of the role of expectations, the stabilizing effects of monetary policy become even greater: If economic decision makers come to realize that the Fed is doing more to stabilize inflation, then shocks that push up inflation will lead to smaller increases in inflation expectations than in the past.",2007-03-12
"Because current inflation is affected by inflation expectations, the smaller increase in expected inflation will lead to a smaller increase in actual inflation as well.",2007-03-12
"And because many shocks that may lead to inflation, such as unexpected surges in spending, also cause movements in output and employment in the same direction, the maintenance of price stability promotes the stability of the real economy.",2007-03-12
"This experience of low and stable inflation, coupled with the Fedâ€™s clear statements of commitment to maintaining this performance, has no doubt contributed to the stability of long-run inflation expectations in the past decade or so.",2007-03-12
By one measure--from the Philadelphia Fedâ€™s Survey of Professional Forecasters--long-run inflation expectations have barely budged since 1998.,2007-03-12
Better monetary policy may also help explain the apparent decline in the sensitivity of inflation to resource utilization.,2007-03-12
We might interpret the reduced statistical correlation between unemployment and inflation as evidence of a decline in the direct effect of resource utilization on inflation.,2007-03-12
"But given that the conduct of monetary policy was changing at the same time, it may be premature to draw such a conclusion.",2007-03-12
Suppose that the Federal Reserve managed to stabilize inflation perfectly.,2007-03-12
"That outcome would eliminate any empirical correlation between inflation and unemployment even if there really was an underlying relationship between inflation and resource utilization operating through the influence of the latter on, say, marginal labor costs.5 As this example illustrates, the correlation between unemployment and inflation may have no bearing on whether these variables are truly linked structurally.",2007-03-12
I hasten to add that I am not advocating that the Fed stabilize inflation perfectly--this is simply an illustrative example.,2007-03-12
"So letâ€™s consider another alternative: Suppose that the Fed is willing to accept some temporary deviation of inflation from its desirable level to moderate an accompanying weakness in real activity, as might occur in the face of an adverse productivity shock.",2007-03-12
"In this instance, the most likely correlation between inflation and unemployment would be positive--that is, under these conditions the relationship between inflation and unemployment would be the exact opposite of the predictions of the old-fashioned Phillips curve.",2007-03-12
"And again, this result could arise even though the structure of the economy was such that an increase in resource utilization would tend to put upward pressure on production costs and thus prices.",2007-03-12
"From this perspective, the declining correlation of resource utilization with inflation may be an indication of the success of monetary policy in pursuing its dual mandate of price stability and maximum sustainable growth: Because the Fed is trying to stabilize both inflation and real activity, then, when faced by shocks that push these variables in the same direction, the Fed will want to try to offset both adverse developments to the extent that it can.",2007-03-12
"Thus, I see the reduced correlation between inflation and unemployment as an indication of the success of monetary policy in this dimension.",2007-03-12
Further evidence that better monetary policy and accompanying expectational effects have promoted a more stable economy is provided by the rather muted inflationary effects of the recent sharp increases in crude oil prices.,2007-03-12
"In the 1970s, inflation moved up sharply with increases in crude oil prices.",2007-03-12
"Moreover, not only did overall inflation move up, but core inflation, wages increases, and inflation expectations moved up as well.",2007-03-12
"In response to the resulting high inflation, the Fed was obliged to raise interest rates, and the economy weakened.",2007-03-12
"True, overall inflation moved up with energy prices, and some of the pickup in core inflation last year probably reflected the transitory effects of the pass-through of increased energy costs.",2007-03-12
"Similarly, when gasoline prices surge, surveys of household inflation expectations still move up, but not for long.",2007-03-12
"Indicators of long-term inflation expectations did not exist in the 1970s, but in the current period, the stability of these expectations has been remarkable.",2007-03-12
"As I shall discuss, other explanations for these changes exist, but in my view, the effects of monetary policy are the most plausible.",2007-03-12
What can the international experience tell us about the likely sources of the changes in inflation dynamics?,2007-03-12
"First, we need to acknowledge that many of the changes we have seen in U.S. inflation dynamics have also occurred in other countries.",2007-03-12
That fact suggests that at least some of the explanations of the change in inflation dynamics should be common across countries rather than country-specific.,2007-03-12
"If monetary policy is central to these changes, it must be the case that many countries have made similar changes to monetary policy.",2007-03-12
"As I noted in a speech last fall, one possible reason for such common changes in monetary policy may have been greater currency competition (Kroszner, 2006).",2007-03-12
"In broad terms, the idea is that increased globalization, deregulation, and innovation raised the returns to low inflation--and increased the penalties for high inflation--relative to results obtained twenty or thirty years ago.",2007-03-12
"As a result, deregulation, globalization, and innovation have made it easier for citizens to move their wealth out of nominal assets in their local currency and thereby avoid any inflation tax should their government show signs that it might resort to inflationary tactics to finance spending.6 At the same time, the publicâ€™s understanding of the costs of inflation has increased, in part because of experiences of high inflation in many countries in the 1980s.",2007-03-12
"Almost everywhere, public opinion eventually turned against allowing inflation to continue.",2007-03-12
This public pressure has reinforced the trend against inflationary policies.,2007-03-12
"Increased competition among currencies, driven by the confluence of factors that I just described, has limited the ability of governments and central banks to pursue high-inflation policies.",2007-03-12
"Moreover, currency competition has raised the costs of poor policy and thus increased the incentives of the monetary authorities to maintain low inflation.",2007-03-12
"Other Explanations for the Change in Inflation Dynamics Of course, monetary policy may not be the whole story, and we need to resist embracing any single explanation too wholeheartedly.",2007-03-12
There may be other reasons for the changes in inflation dynamics.,2007-03-12
"For example, the reduced sensitivity of core inflation to oil and natural gas prices likely also reflects both the increased energy efficiency of the economy and the fact that shocks to the prices of these goods since the mid-1980s have, at least until the latest episode, been viewed as mostly temporary.",2007-03-12
"In contrast, the rise in oil prices during the 1970s was probably seen at the time as largely reflecting a permanent shift in global demand/supply balances.",2007-03-12
Another factor that might help to account for some of the changes in inflation dynamics is globalization.,2007-03-12
This development could help to account for any reduced sensitivity of U.S. inflation to domestic resource utilization.,2007-03-12
"In fact, one recent study even purports to show that foreign output gaps are more important in explaining domestic inflation in industrialized countries than domestic factors (Borio and Filardo, 2006).",2007-03-12
"Other factors may also be at work, such as the deregulation of the 1980s and the faster productivity growth we have seen over the past decade.",2007-03-12
"But I think that even after we have given these factors their appropriate due, the evidence still suggests that better monetary policy explains much (albeit not all) of the changes in inflation dynamics that have occurred.",2007-03-12
"In fact, it is interesting to speculate on the degree to which better monetary policy might account for some of the structural factors I have listed.",2007-03-12
Consider faster productivity growth.,2007-03-12
High and variable inflation likely creates a distraction for firms--managers must pay attention to the damage that inflation can do to their balance sheets.,2007-03-12
Such distraction likely hurts the productivity of firms.,2007-03-12
"Although I donâ€™t think low inflation is the only factor behind the rebound in productivity growth in the United States--after all, other countries did not see such an acceleration in output per hour as inflation came down--I think it has played a role.",2007-03-12
Policy Implications A review of the possible causes of the changes in inflation dynamics naturally leads to the question of their implications for the conduct of monetary policy.,2007-03-12
"In todayâ€™s economy, it is very difficult to know whether any given change in output or employment will have inflationary consequences.",2007-03-12
"One lesson that is fair to draw, however, is that resource utilization generally does not tell us much about the future course of inflation over the next year or two.",2007-03-12
"Rather, the near-term inflation outlook is more likely to be dominated by cost factors, such as productivity growth and the price of raw materials, than by the tightness of labor and product markets.",2007-03-12
"Furthermore, the weak relationship between inflation and the unemployment rate means that it is probably more difficult than ever to gauge the economyâ€™s productive potential--and hence estimate so-called output gaps--especially in real time.",2007-03-12
My earlier comments also underscored the central importance of expectations to the successful conduct of monetary policy.,2007-03-12
"In particular, the Federal Reserve and many other central banks appear to have succeeded in anchoring long-run inflation expectations--an achievement that has contributed to macroeconomic stability and eased the task of monetary policy.",2007-03-12
The final lesson I draw is a cautionary note: The stability of inflation could lead to complacency.,2007-03-12
"As long as inflation expectations are well anchored, actual inflation will have a natural tendency to revert to the anchor of long-run inflation expectations.",2007-03-12
"Under such circumstances, policymakers may be tempted to relax their resolve in responding to potentially inflationary developments.",2007-03-12
Inflation expectations have become well-anchored because the public has become confident that the Federal Reserve will do the right thing.,2007-03-12
But this belief will persist only as long as we on the Federal Open Market Committee continue to ratify the publicâ€™s expectations that inflation will remain low and stable.,2007-03-12
"Thus, complacency would be a threat to the credibility that the Federal Reserve has worked so hard to acquire, and its loss would likely mean the reversal of many of the favorable inflation developments seen over the past two decades.",2007-03-12
One message that I hope has been clear is that there is much we donâ€™t know about the inflation process.,2007-03-12
"I'll mention our principal duties and then focus on one--monetary policy, the responsibility that gets the most public attention.",2017-01-18
"In addition to monetary policy, we--in collaboration with other regulatory agencies at both the federal and state levels--oversee banks and some other financial institutions to ensure they operate safely and soundly and treat their customers fairly.",2017-01-18
We also reliably and safely process trillions of dollars of payments for the nation's banks and the federal government and ensure that banks have an ample supply of currency and coin to meet the demands of their depositors.,2017-01-18
"But, as I noted, monetary policy draws the most headlines.",2017-01-18
"What is monetary policy, exactly?",2017-01-18
"Simply put, it consists of central bank actions aimed at influencing interest rates and financial conditions more generally.",2017-01-18
"But monetary policy cannot, by itself, create a healthy economy.",2017-01-18
I've said what monetary policy cannot do.,2017-01-18
"Nearly 40 years ago, the Congress set two main guideposts for that task--maximum employment and price stability.",2017-01-18
"When the economy is weak and unemployment is on the rise, we encourage spending and investing by pushing short-term interest rates lower.",2017-01-18
"As you may know, the interest rate that we target is the federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans.",2017-01-18
"Lowering short-term rates in turn puts downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, making credit more affordable--for families, for instance, to buy a house or for businesses to expand.",2017-01-18
"Similarly, when the economy is threatening to push inflation too high down the road, we increase interest rates to keep the economy on a sustainable path and lean against its tendency to boom and then bust.",2017-01-18
"But what exactly do the terms ""maximum employment"" and ""price stability"" mean?",2017-01-18
Does maximum employment mean that every single person who wants a job has a job?,2017-01-18
This so-called frictional unemployment is evident even in the healthiest of economies.,2017-01-18
Then there is structural unemployment--a difficult problem both for the people affected and for policymakers trying to address it.,2017-01-18
These are factors over which monetary policy has little influence.,2017-01-18
Other measures--such as job training and other workforce development programs--are better suited to address structural unemployment.,2017-01-18
"After taking account of both frictional and structural unemployment, what unemployment rate is roughly equivalent to the maximum level of employment that can be sustained in the longer run?",2017-01-18
"It's important to try to estimate the unemployment rate that is equivalent to maximum employment because persistently operating below it pushes inflation higher, which brings me to our price stability mandate.",2017-01-18
Does price stability mean having no inflation whatsoever?,2017-01-18
"By ""price stability,"" we mean a level of inflation that is low and stable enough that it doesn't need to figure prominently into people's and businesses' economic decisions.",2017-01-18
"Based on research and decades of experience, we define that level as 2 percent a year--an inflation objective similar to that adopted by most other major central banks.1 Individual prices, of course, move up and down by more than 2 percent all the time.",2017-01-18
They allow supply and demand to adjust for various goods and services.,2017-01-18
"By ""inflation,"" we mean price changes as a whole for all of the various goods and services that households consume.",2017-01-18
"No one likes high inflation, and it is easy to understand why.",2017-01-18
"Although wages and prices tend to move in tandem over long periods, inflation erodes household purchasing power if it is not matched with similar increases in wages, and it eats away the value of households' savings.",2017-01-18
"So, then, why don't we and other central banks aim for zero inflation?",2017-01-18
"There are several technical reasons, but a more fundamental reason is to create a buffer against the opposite of inflation--that is, deflation.",2017-01-18
"Deflation is a general and persistent decline in the level of prices, a phenomenon Americans last experienced during the Great Depression of the 1930s and one that Japan has confronted for most of the past two decades.",2017-01-18
I am sure we all remember learning in school about farm families in the Great Depression who couldn't pay their mortgages and lost their homes and their livelihoods when crop prices fell persistently.,2017-01-18
Another important reason to maintain a modest inflation buffer is that too low inflation impairs the ability of monetary policy to counter economic downturns.,2017-01-18
"When inflation is very low, interest rates tend to be very low also, even in good times.",2017-01-18
"And when interest rates are generally very low, the Fed has only limited room to cut them to help the economy in bad times.",2017-01-18
"In a nutshell, the Fed's goal is to promote financial conditions conducive to maximum employment and price stability.",2017-01-18
"Unemployment peaked at 10 percent late in 2009, a level unseen for more than 25 years, and didn't move below 8 percent for nearly three years.",2017-01-18
"Falling home prices put millions of homeowners ""underwater,"" meaning they owed more on their mortgages than their homes were worth.",2017-01-18
"The extraordinarily severe recession required an extraordinary response from monetary policy, both to support the job market and prevent deflation.",2017-01-18
We cut our short-term interest rate target to near zero at the end of 2008 and kept it there for seven years.,2017-01-18
"To provide further support to American households and businesses, we pressed down on longer-term interest rates by purchasing large amounts of longer-term Treasury securities and government-guaranteed mortgage securities.",2017-01-18
"And we communicated our intent to keep short-term interest rates low for a long time, thus increasing the downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, which are influenced by expectations about short-term rates.",2017-01-18
"Now, it's fair to say, the economy is near maximum employment and inflation is moving toward our goal.",2017-01-18
"The unemployment rate is less than 5 percent, roughly back to where it was before the recession.",2017-01-18
"Although inflation has been running below our 2 percent objective for quite some time, we have seen it start inching back toward 2 percent last year as the job market continued to improve and as the effects of a big drop in oil prices faded.",2017-01-18
"Last month, at our most recent meeting, we took account of the considerable progress the economy has made by modestly increasing our short-term interest rate target by 1/4 percentage point to a range of 1/2 to 3/4 percent.",2017-01-18
What I can tell you is what we expect--along with a very large caveat that our interest rate expectations will change as our outlook for the economy changes.,2017-01-18
"Our foot remains on the pedal in part because we want to make sure the economic expansion remains strong enough to withstand an unexpected shock, given that we don't have much room to cut interest rates.",2017-01-18
"In addition, inflation is still running below our 2 percent objective, and, by some measures, there may still be some room for progress in the job market.",2017-01-18
"For instance, wage growth has only recently begun to pick up and remains fairly low.",2017-01-18
A broader measure of unemployment isn't quite back to its pre-recession level.,2017-01-18
"Nevertheless, as the economy approaches our objectives, it makes sense to gradually reduce the level of monetary policy support.",2017-01-18
Changes in monetary policy take time to work their way into the economy.,2017-01-18
"Waiting too long to begin moving toward the neutral rate could risk a nasty surprise down the road--either too much inflation, financial instability, or both.",2017-01-18
"In that scenario, we could be forced to raise interest rates rapidly, which in turn could push the economy into a new recession.",2017-01-18
But a longer-term trend--slow productivity growth--helps explain why we don't think dramatic interest rate increases are required to move our federal funds rate target back to neutral.,2017-01-18
"Labor productivity--that is, the output of goods and services per hour of work--has increased by only about 1/2 percent a year, on average, over the past six years or so and only 1-1/4 percent a year over the past decade.",2017-01-18
That contrasts with the previous 30 years when productivity grew a bit more than 2 percent a year.,2017-01-18
This productivity slowdown matters enormously because Americans' standard of living depends on productivity growth.,2017-01-18
"With productivity growth of 2 percent a year, the average standard of living will double roughly every 35 years.",2017-01-18
But productivity growth of 1 percent a year means the average standard of living will double only every 70 years.,2017-01-18
Economists do not fully understand the causes of the productivity slowdown.,2017-01-18
"While each of these factors has likely played a role in slowing productivity growth, the extent to which they will continue to do so is an open question.2 Why does slow productivity growth, if it persists, imply a lower neutral interest rate?",2017-01-18
"First, it implies that the economy's usual rate of output growth, when employment is at its maximum and prices are stable, will be significantly slower than the post-World War II average.",2017-01-18
"Slower economic growth, in turn, implies businesses will see less need to invest in expansion.",2017-01-18
"Because interest rates are the mechanism that brings the supply of savings and the demand for investment funds into balance, more saving and less investment imply a lower neutral interest rate.",2017-01-18
"Although we can't directly measure the neutral interest rate, it is something that can be estimated in retrospect.",2017-01-18
"If you are a borrower, it means that, although the interest rates you pay on, say, your auto loan or mortgage or credit card likely will creep higher, they probably will not increase dramatically.",2017-01-18
"At the end of the day, we all benefit from plentiful jobs and stable prices, whether we are savers or borrowers--and many of us, of course, are both.",2017-01-18
"Economics and monetary policy are, at best, inexact sciences.",2017-01-18
Figuring out what the neutral interest rate is and setting the right path toward it is not like setting the thermostat in a house: You can't just set the temperature at 68 degrees and walk away.,2017-01-18
"And, because changes in monetary policy affect the economy with long lags sometimes, we must base our decisions on our best forecasts of an uncertain future.",2017-01-18
One of the foremost challenges has been forecasting productivity developments and their macroeconomic implications.,2006-09-27
"As you know, productivity growth is the key source of higher living standards in the long run.",2006-09-27
"But, of course, it also is an important influence shaping shorter-run economic developments as well as monetary policy decisions.",2006-09-27
"Today I will talk about some of the forces that drive productivity growth, the macroeconomic implications of changes in the longer-run trend of productivity, and the prospects for productivity growth.",2006-09-27
The revolution in information technology (IT) is commonly taken as the initiating force behind the acceleration in productivity seen since 1995.,2006-09-27
"As I will describe in more detail, this interaction effect of IT with a flexible economy can help to explain why the IT revolution has produced higher productivity growth in the United States but not in many other industrialized economies.",2006-09-27
"While it is important for policymakers to understand the sources of the productivity resurgence, it is also important for us to understand the macroeconomic implications.",2006-09-27
"An often overlooked implication is that, all else equal, an increase in the growth rate of productivity will tend to put upward pressure on real interest rates.",2006-09-27
"In particular, I believe one reason is that sound economic policies have created a more stable economic environment, and with that has come low and stable inflation and an ongoing desire by foreigners to invest in the United States to reap higher returns associated with higher productivity growth than may be available in their economies.",2006-09-27
"At bottom, I expect that the flexibility of U.S. markets will continue to provide a nourishing environment for technological and process advances, and that very flexibility, along with sound monetary policy, will also allow the U.S. economy to enjoy the benefits of the evolving macroeconomic dynamics that accelerating productivity sets in motion.",2006-09-27
"A Framework for Analyzing the Growth of Labor ProductivityA great success story for the American economy has been the resurgence of productivity growth that began around 1995.1 From 1973 to 1995, labor productivity in the nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate of 1-1/2 percent.",2006-09-27
(Labor productivity is defined in terms of output per hour of work in the economy.),2006-09-27
"In contrast, from 1995 to 2000, productivity accelerated to a 2-1/2 percent rate.",2006-09-27
"Perhaps even more remarkably, despite a recession, the fall of the dot-com market, a broad stock market correction, terrorism, and corporate governance scandals, productivity has accelerated even further since 2000.",2006-09-27
"Despite some slowing in the past few quarters, productivity in the nonfarm business sector has risen at an average annual rate of about 3 percent over the past 5-1/2 years.",2006-09-27
"Many economists, including myself, use growth accounting as a framework for analyzing productivity developments.",2006-09-27
"In its simplest terms, growth accounting decomposes the growth rate of labor productivity into two major components.",2006-09-27
"One is the contribution to productivity growth that comes from giving workers more capital to work with, such as equipment or software; the standard term for this component is ""capital deepening.""",2006-09-27
"The other major contribution comes from the growth of multifactor productivity--that is, the efficiency with which labor and capital are combined to create output.2 Multifactor productivity growth reflects such things as business process innovations--for example, enhanced supply-chain management techniques or more-effective retail store layouts; advancements in technology, such as the development of new-generation computer chips; or most any other type of improvement in the efficiency of a firmâ€™s operations.",2006-09-27
This aggregate growth-accounting framework forms the economic underpinning of key comprehensive productivity statistics produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.,2006-09-27
"Work done over the past decade takes a somewhat more disaggregated approach to growth accounting in order to get inside the aggregate numbers and try to get a better handle on the sources of our remarkable productivity performance since 1995.3 But all of this is just accounting--albeit, in some research, very elaborate and painstakingly constructed accounting.",2006-09-27
"The deeper analytical questions are, What are the forces driving capital deepening and the growth of multifactor productivity, especially since 1995, and Why does the United States seem to have experienced increased productivity growth, since the mid-1990s, that has not been shared by many other industrial economies?",2006-09-27
"The Forces Driving the Growth of Labor ProductivityIn broad terms, the story for the post-1995 productivity resurgence that comes out of the various studies that take a disaggregated approach, as well as case studies such as those conducted by McKinsey (2002), is well known.",2006-09-27
"Technological advances in the IT-producing sector--that is, multifactor productivity--and associated investments in more and better production equipment (capital deepening) started things off.",2006-09-27
"If productivity growth were simply a matter of installing ever-more-powerful computers or reading ever-more-advanced technical manuals, then all countries with access to the breakthroughs in information technology from the past two decades should have enjoyed the same productivity revival as the United States.",2006-09-27
"Since 1995, productivity in the United States has grown substantially faster than in other advanced industrial countries.",2006-09-27
"For example, a recent study by van Ark and Inklaar (2005) indicates that while productivity in the United States accelerated after 1995, average productivity in Europe actually decelerated--indeed, they estimate that the trend in the fifteen countries that made up the European Union before 2004 has been decelerating since the mid-1980s.",2006-09-27
"According to van Ark and Inklaar, some of the differential reflects faster capital deepening in the United States, but much of it reflects a surge in multifactor productivity growth in the United States outside of the IT sector since 2000.4 Innovations in information technology, however, cannot be the whole story--flexibility at the firm level and in labor markets, and competitive pressure throughout the economy, also play their roles.5 Businesses must be flexible enough to adopt new technologies and then to transform themselves in ways that allow technology-intensive investment to have the highest possible effect on productivity growth.",2006-09-27
"Similarly, labor markets must be flexible enough to allow for the prompt re-allocation of resources in response to changes in demand.",2006-09-27
"As discussed in a recent in-depth study by McKinsey & Co., IT investments were combined with a host of changes in business practices to raise productivity.",2006-09-27
"Eventually, productivity rose so much that the firm painted the windows of this site black so that competitors could not see how the new system worked!",2006-09-27
There is an important historical parallel in the United States to the interaction of technological innovation and flexibility in producing higher productivity growth.,2006-09-27
"In the early twentieth century, the electrification of production operations and the electric motor did not substantially raise manufacturing productivity until firms realized that electricity allowed them to rethink the layout of their factories.",2006-09-27
"More generally, research conducted at the Federal Reserve suggests that regulatory environments in a number of industrial countries have impeded the adoption of information technologies and slowed productivity growth (Gust and Marquez, 2004).",2006-09-27
An interesting illustration of the connection is the productivity of multinational corporations.,2006-09-27
Taking Account of Productivity in a Macro ForecastLet me switch gears now from the sources of our remarkable productivity performance to some of its macroeconomic implications.,2006-09-27
"A good deal of research, including the Boardâ€™s large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy (FRB/US), suggests that what is called Sayâ€™s law still holds.7 That is, in the model, an increase in the level of productivity (reflecting, for example, some technological advance) causes businesses and financial markets to revise upward their views about the level of expected profits, and it causes households to revise upward their views about the level of permanent income.",2006-09-27
"A dynamic feedback also occurs on the supply side as the higher level of investment spending increases the capital stock (relative to the supply of worker hours), which gives a small fillip to productivity and potential output.",2006-09-27
"Ultimately, the increases in aggregate supply are matched by an equivalent increase in aggregate demand.8 This is, of course, Sayâ€™s law.",2006-09-27
What Iâ€™ve just described is a sketch of what happens after a one-time rise in the level of productivity.,2006-09-27
"In the case of an ongoing rise in the growth rate of productivity, the dynamics and macro consequences are more complicated.",2006-09-27
"In particular, all else equal, a positive shock to the growth rate of productivity will tend to put upward pressure on real interest rates.9 The upward pressure on real interest occurs, in part, because investment must rise to keep the growth of the capital stock in line with the faster growth of gross domestic product.",2006-09-27
"In addition, a shock to the growth rate of productivity boosts householdâ€™s assessments of the growth rate of their permanent income, while increases in the expected growth rate of profits and dividends raise asset values, including the value of equities, relative to current income.",2006-09-27
"The combination of faster expected growth of permanent income and higher stock market wealth tends to raise consumption relative to income and, concomitantly, lower personal saving.",2006-09-27
"Thus, all else equal, the increase in demand for financing relative to domestic saving will tend to boost real interest rates.10 The dynamics of this process, and how long they take to play out, depend on several factors.",2006-09-27
One factor is how quickly the productivity change is incorporated into household and business expectations.,2006-09-27
The change in expectations can be drawn out if households and firms are slow to recognize an inflection point in the productivity growth trend or are highly uncertain about how long any observed change in the data might last.,2006-09-27
"To his credit, Chairman Greenspan was one of the first to call the sea change in our productivity performance to public attention.11 Another factor influencing the dynamics of the process the degree to which businesses, financial markets and consumers are forward-looking in their economic behavior.",2006-09-27
"If they are myopic in their behavior or tend to discount the future very heavily, then the dynamic response of the economy to a change in the growth rate of productivity will be drawn out.",2006-09-27
"At this point, you might be saying to yourself, ""Hold on; if an increase in the productivity growth trend is supposed to boost real interest rates, why have real rates been falling since around mid-2004 and are low by historical standards?""",2006-09-27
"Importantly, the term premium embedded in interest rates has been falling.",2006-09-27
The term premium reflects the extent of uncertainty about future prospects for inflation and for real economic activity.,2006-09-27
"Real activity has become less volatile; moreover, inflation is lower and, as long as we at the Federal Reserve do our job, more predictable.12 The huge inflow of foreign saving into the United States, undoubtedly, also has been important.",2006-09-27
The higher prospective returns in the United States may be due in part to the higher productivity growth that the United States has been experiencing relative to many other industrialized countries resulting from the interaction effect of IT innovations and the flexibility of the United States economy relative to other countries.,2006-09-27
What about the effects of a productivity shock on inflation?,2006-09-27
Ultimately inflation is determined by the policy actions of the central bank.,2006-09-27
"In the short run, however, a change in the trend growth rate of productivity can influence inflation dynamics.",2006-09-27
"A one-time change in the level of productivity, or transitory volatility in productivity growth rates, are unlikely to have lasting effects on business pricing behavior.",2006-09-27
"Economic theory and econometric evidence suggest that only a persistent shock to the rate of change of productivity has persistent consequences for rate of change of prices--that is, inflation.",2006-09-27
"If we lived in a world with no impediments to competition in labor and product markets, with prices and wages that freely and quickly moved up and down in response to shifts in economic conditions, then a change in productivity growth would be promptly matched by a corresponding change in nominal compensation per hour.",2006-09-27
"As a consequence, unit labor costs would be unchanged, and all else equal, so would inflation.",2006-09-27
"Nominal compensation per hour initially seems to respond sluggishly to changes in the economy, including productivity shocks.",2006-09-27
"As a result, an increase in productivity growth, for example, initially slows the growth of unit labor costs, which firms--under competitive pressure--then pass on to their customers, thereby slowing price inflation.",2006-09-27
"As price inflation slows and as, with a lag, nominal compensation per hour accelerates, the growth rate of real compensation per hour increases so that over time workers share in the benefits of faster productivity growth.",2006-09-27
"Indeed, in the past, any rise in the level of productivity has eventually been fully translated into a rise in the level of real compensation per hour.",2006-09-27
"Productivity and Real Compensation Per HourWhat I have dubbed the re-equilibration of productivity and real compensation per hour is just another manifestation of one of the great stylized facts of macroeconomics: In the past, deviations in the labor share of income from its mean value of roughly two-thirds have eventually been reversed.",2006-09-27
"As it turns out--Iâ€™ll leave the proof to you as a homework assignment--mean reversion in the labor share is equivalent to the observation that over time labor productivity and real compensation per hour have moved together; in the jargon of econometrics, they are co-integrated.",2006-09-27
"As I just mentioned, when the labor share deviates from its long-run average or, equivalently, a gap opens between productivity and real compensation per hour, the reversion to the mean (that is, the closing of the gap) can take quite a while.",2006-09-27
"In recent years, the labor share has moved down as increases in real compensation per hour have, for the most part, lagged behind productivity growth, but the timing and extent of the change in the labor share depends in part on the particular statistical measure chosen.13 A challenge for forecasters is deciphering whether this latest drop in the labor share is transitory, as such drops have been in the past, or whether some structural aspect of the economy, such as the wage-bargaining process, has changed to make the drop in the labor share permanent.",2006-09-27
"Assuming that the drop is transitory, another challenge for forecasters is predicting whether the adjustment to real compensation per hour will be driven by a pickup in the growth of nominal compensation per hour or by a reduction in inflation.",2006-09-27
Prospects for ProductivityLet me close with some comments on the outlook for productivity.,2006-09-27
"Recent estimates by a number of economists suggest that the underlying trend in productivity in the nonfarm business sector is about 2-1/2 percent per year, close to the rate of productivity growth achieved during the period from 1995 to 2000.14 I think a good case can be made for the view that the strong productivity growth of the post-1995 era will persist for some time.",2006-09-27
"The rate of technology growth appears to be proceeding apace, and further diffusion of already existing technologies and applications to more firms and industries should continue to boost productivity.",2006-09-27
"ConclusionAn important lesson of the U.S. productivity resurgence is that an open economy with flexible labor, capital, and product markets is critical for a nation to enjoy the full benefits of recent IT innovation and, thus, to enhance a nationâ€™s productivity performance going forward.",2006-09-27
"In my opinion, the productivity developments that we are likely to see in coming years will be fostered by a U.S. economy that remains very flexible, highly competitive, and open--if anything, it is becoming even more flexible, competitive, and open.",2006-09-27

"It is an honor to be here with Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, who pioneered the original Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy in 2012.",2020-09-01
"Key Longer-Run Changes in the Economy Three related features of the economy's new normal called for the reassessment of the Committee's longer-run goals and strategy.2 First, the equilibrium interest rate has fallen to low levels, which implies a large decline in how much we can cut interest rates to support the economy.",2020-09-01
"The reduced scope to cut the interest rate could increase the frequency and duration of periods when the policy rate is pinned close to zero, unemployment is elevated, and inflation is below target.",2020-09-01
"In turn, the greater likelihood of extended periods of low inflation at the lower bound risks eroding inflation expectations and further compressing the scope for cutting the interest rate.",2020-09-01
"The risk here is a downward spiral where the scope for cutting the interest rate gets compressed even further, the lower bound binds even more frequently, and it becomes increasingly difficult to move inflation expectations and inflation back up to target.",2020-09-01
"Second, underlying trend inflation appears to be somewhat below the Committee's 2 percent objective, according to various statistical filters.4 The near decade of inflation persistently short of 2 percent creates the risk that households and businesses come to expect inflation to run persistently below target and change their behavior in a way that fulfills that expectation, which greatly complicates the task of monetary policy.",2020-09-01
"While inflation expectations are difficult to measure with precision, some market-based and survey-based indicators show signs of a downward drift.",2020-09-01
Ensuring that longer-term inflation expectations are well-anchored at 2 percent is critical to achieving target inflation.,2020-09-01
"Finally, the sensitivity of price inflation to labor market tightness is very low relative to earlier decades, which is what economists mean when they say that the Phillips curve is flat.5 A flat Phillips curve has the important advantage of allowing employment to continue expanding for longer without generating inflationary pressures, thereby providing job opportunities to people that might not otherwise have them.",2020-09-01
It also means that it is harder to achieve our 2 percent inflation objective on a sustained basis when inflation expectations have drifted below 2 percent.,2020-09-01
"First, the statement defines the statutory maximum level of employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal and eliminates the reference to a numerical estimate of the longer-run normal unemployment rate.6 The longstanding presumption that accommodation should be reduced preemptively when the unemployment rate nears the neutral rate in anticipation of high inflation that is unlikely to materialize risks an unwarranted loss of opportunity for many Americans.",2020-09-01
"The decision to allow the labor market to continue healing after the unemployment rate effectively reached the 5 percent median Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) estimate of the normal unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2015 supported a further decrease of 3-1/2 percentage points in the Black unemployment rate and of 2-1/4 percentage points in the Hispanic unemployment rate, as well as an increase of nearly 3 percentage points in the labor force participation rate of prime-age women.",2020-09-01
"It also created conditions for the entry of a further 3-1/2 million prime-age Americans into the labor force, a movement of nearly 1 million people out of long-term unemployment, and opportunities for 2 million involuntary part-time workers to secure full-time jobs.7 Beyond that, had the changes to monetary policy goals and strategy we made in the new statement been in place several years ago, it is likely that accommodation would have been withdrawn later, and the gains would have been greater.",2020-09-01
"Instead of an aggregate ""normal"" unemployment rate, the Committee's commitment to defining the maximum level of employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal, together with our continued commitment to consider a wide range of indicators, may be particularly significant for the groups that are most vulnerable to employment fluctuations.8 Both research and experience suggest the groups that face the greatest structural challenges in the labor market are likely to be the first to experience layoffs during downturns and the last to experience employment gains during recoveries.",2020-09-01
"Research by the Federal Reserve Board staff finds that unemployment rates, as well as patterns of job loss and labor force entry and exit, are more cyclically sensitive for Blacks and Hispanics than for whites, and observable worker characteristics can explain very little of these differentials.9 A similar observation was one of the key takeaways from the Fed Listens sessions we held around the country.10 Juan Salgado, chancellor of the City Colleges of Chicago, described how last year's tight labor market was finally giving his students, who are largely Black and Latinx, the opportunity to apprentice with local businesses in jobs that historically have not been open to them.11 Moreover, earnings from wages are particularly important for these groups, who have large and persistent wealth gaps and derive a smaller share of their income from financial asset holdings or from business ownership.12 Second, to address the downward bias to inflation associated with the proximity to the effective lower bound, the statement adopts a flexible inflation averaging strategy that seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time in order to ensure longer-term inflation expectations are well anchored at 2 percent.",2020-09-01
Flexible average inflation targeting (FAIT) is a consequential change in strategy.,2020-09-01
"By committing to seek inflation that averages 2 percent over time, FAIT means that appropriate monetary policy would likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for a time to compensate for a period, such as the present, when it has been persistently below 2 percent.13 Consistent with this, I would expect the Committee to accommodate rather than offset inflationary pressures moderately above 2 percent, in a process of opportunistic reflation.",2020-09-01
"Flexible average inflation targeting is a pragmatic way to implement a makeup strategy, which is essential to arrest any downward drift in inflation expectations.14 While a formal average inflation target (AIT) rule is appealing in theory, there are likely to be communications and implementation challenges in practice related to time-consistency and the mechanical nature of such rules.",2020-09-01
"Analysis suggests it could take many years with a formal AIT rule to return the price level to target following a lower-bound episode, and a mechanical AIT rule is likely to become increasingly difficult to explain and implement as conditions change over time.15 In contrast, FAIT is better suited for the highly uncertain and dynamic context in which policymaking takes place.",2020-09-01
"In my mind, the commitment to undertake a review of the new strategy and goals in roughly five years is a necessary complement to the flexibility embedded in the new inflation averaging strategy.",2020-09-01
"As such, the five-year review will provide a vital checkpoint to see how well flexible average inflation targeting is working and, in my thinking, provide some insights into an appropriate makeup period.",2020-09-01
"Whereas previously it sought to mitigate deviations of employment and inflation from their targets in either direction, the Committee will now seek ""to mitigate shortfalls of employment from the Committee's assessment of its maximum level and deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal.""",2020-09-01
"This change implies that the Committee effectively will set monetary policy to minimize the welfare costs of shortfalls of employment from its maximum and not preemptively withdraw support based on a historically steeper Phillips curve that is not currently in evidence and inflation that is correspondingly much less likely to materialize.16 Consistent with this, the statement drops language about a ""balanced approach"" that might be interpreted as calling for the preemptive withdrawal of accommodation and replaces it with a more accurate description of how we pursue our dual-mandate goals in parallel.",2020-09-01
"Fourth and finally, the statement codifies the key lesson from the Global Financial Crisisâ€”that financial stability is necessary for the achievement of our statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability.",2020-09-01
The same changes in the macroeconomic environment that prompted our monetary policy review have important implications for financial stability.,2020-09-01
"Historically, when the Phillips curve was steeper, inflation tended to rise as the economy heated up.",2020-09-01
"The rise in inflation would prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to restrictive levels, which would have the effect of tightening financial conditions more broadly.",2020-09-01
"In contrast, the past few cycles did not see this kind of behavior, and in each case, financial imbalances, rather than goods and services inflation, were notably elevated at the onset of the downturn.",2020-09-01
"With a flat Phillips curve and low inflation, the Committee would have to sustain the federal funds rate below the neutral rate for much longer in order to push inflation back to target sustainably.",2020-09-01
"The resulting expectation of lower-for-longer interest rates, along with sustained high rates of resource utilization, is conducive to increasing risk appetite, reach-for-yield behavior, and incentives for leverageâ€”which can boost financial imbalances as an expansion extends.",2020-09-01
"In this way, the combination of a low neutral rate, a flat Phillips curve, and low underlying inflation can lead to more cyclical volatility in asset prices.",2020-09-01
"With financial stability risks more tightly linked to the business cycle, it is vital to use macroprudential as well as standard prudential tools as the first line of defense in order to allow monetary policy to remain focused on achieving maximum employment and 2 percent average inflation.17 Supporting the Recovery The Committee's new statement on goals and strategy will put us in a stronger position to support a full and timely recovery in employment and average inflation of 2 percent.",2020-09-01
"Encouragingly, the housing sector has rebounded strongly from its initial decline, supported by historically low mortgage rates, and consumer spending on goods has held up well, in part reflecting earlier fiscal support.18 At the same time, however, the strong pace of improvement in employment in May and June, which was importantly driven by recall hiring out of temporary layoffs, appears to have slowed.19 And on the inflation front, despite some bounceback in July, inflation remains weaker than pre-crisis, and it is likely to take some time to return closer to target.20 Looking ahead, the economy continues to face considerable uncertainty associated with the vagaries of the COVID-19 pandemic, and risks are tilted to the downside.",2020-09-01
"With the recovery likely to face COVID-19-related headwinds for some time, in coming months, it will be important for monetary policy to pivot from stabilization to accommodation.",2020-09-01
"As we move to the next phase of monetary policy, we will be guided by the Committee's new goals and strategy statement.",2020-09-01
"It will be important to provide the requisite accommodation to achieve maximum employment and average inflation of 2 percent over time, following persistent underperformance.",2020-09-01
"From the early 1970s until about 1995, productivity growth in the U.S. nonfarm business sector averaged about 1-1/2 percent per year--a disappointingly low figure relative both to U.S. historical experience and to the performance of other industrial economies over the same period.1 Between 1995 and 2000, however, the rate of productivity growth picked up significantly, to about 2-1/2 percent per year--a figure that contributed to the view, held by many at the time, that the United States might be entering a new economic era.",2006-08-31
"Yet, remarkably, productivity accelerated further in the early part of this decade.",2006-08-31
"From the end of 2000 to the end of 2003, productivity rose at a 3-1/2 percent annual rate and, even after recent downward revisions to the data, it is estimated to have increased at an average annual rate of 2-1/4 percent since the end of 2003.",2006-08-31
Why is the rate of productivity growth so important?,2006-08-31
"Economists agree that, in the long run, productivity growth is the principal source of improvements in living standards.",2006-08-31
"The link between the growth of productivity and the standard of living of the average person is somewhat looser in the short-to-medium run, because variation in factors such as the share of the population that is employed, the division of income between capital and labor, and the distribution of each type of income across households also matters.",2006-08-31
"Nevertheless, the rate of productivity growth influences the economy in important ways even in the short run, affecting key variables such as the growth rate of output, employment gains, and the rate of inflation.",2006-08-31
Today I will discuss the acceleration of productivity that has occurred over the past decade and our current understanding of its causes.,2006-08-31
In the discussion I will comment on two puzzles raised by this improved performance and then conclude by briefly addressing the longer-term prospects for productivity growth in the United States.,2006-08-31
Productivity Resurgence and Its CausesWhat underlies the resurgence in U.S. productivity growth?,2006-08-31
Explanations of the rise in productivity growth since about 1995 have evolved somewhat over time.,2006-08-31
"By 2000 or so, an emerging consensus held that the pickup in productivity growth was, for the most part, the product of both rapid technological progress and increased investment in new information and communication technologies (IT) during the 1990s (see Jorgenson and Stiroh, 2000, and Oliner and Sichel, 2000).",2006-08-31
"According to this view, developments in IT promoted U.S. productivity growth in two ways.",2006-08-31
"First, technological advances allowed the IT-producing sectors themselves to exhibit rapid productivity growth.",2006-08-31
Both the more-rapid pace of production and the higher average quality of output raised productivity at Intel as well as at competing firms that were forced to keep pace.,2006-08-31
"Second, advances in information technology also promoted productivity growth outside the IT-producing sector, as firms in a wide range of industries expanded their investments in high-tech equipment and software and used the new technologies to reduce costs and increase quality.",2006-08-31
"Some large retailers, for example, developed IT-based tools to improve the management of their supply chains and to increase their responsiveness to changes in the level and mix of customer demands.",2006-08-31
Securities brokers and dealers achieved substantial productivity gains by automating their trading processes and their back-office operations.,2006-08-31
"One study (Stiroh, 2002) found that a majority of U.S. industries experienced an acceleration of productivity in the latter part of the 1990s.",2006-08-31
"Undoubtedly, the IT revolution and the resurgence of productivity in the United States after 1995 were closely connected.",2006-08-31
"However, the technology-based explanation of increased productivity growth does raise a couple of puzzles (see, for example, McKinsey and Company, 2001 and 2005, and Basu and others, 2003).",2006-08-31
"Yet, with a few exceptions, the available data show that productivity growth in other advanced countries has not increased to the extent seen in the United States.",2006-08-31
"Second, as I have noted, productivity growth increased very rapidly earlier this decade and has continued to rise at a solid pace, even though IT investment declined sharply after the stock prices of high-tech firms plummeted in 2000.",2006-08-31
"More generally, as a historical matter, increases in IT investment have not always been followed in short order by increases in productivity growth.",2006-08-31
"This observation raises the question of why, in some cases, the putative productivity benefits of investments in new technologies do not occur until years after those investments are made.",2006-08-31
In regard to the first puzzle--the fact that the United States has enjoyed greater productivity growth in recent years than other advanced countries--the comparison with Europe is particularly interesting.,2006-08-31
"Throughout most of the post-World War II period, productivity growth in Europe exceeded that in the United States, at first because of the rapid gains during the postwar reconstruction and then later because of a gradual convergence of European technology and business practices to American standards.",2006-08-31
"By one estimate, European productivity increased from 44 percent of the U.S. level in 1950 to near-equality with the United States by 1995 (Gordon, 2004 and 2006).",2006-08-31
"However, the available data suggest that, since about 1995, productivity growth in European nations has slowed, on average, in contrast to the pickup experienced in the United States.",2006-08-31
"These trends have led to an increasing divergence in productivity levels in the United States and Europe (see van Ark and Inklaar, 2005).",2006-08-31
"Researchers have made the important point that differences in productivity growth between the United States and Europe appear not to have been particularly large in the IT-producing sectors, where U.S. strengths in the development of computers and semiconductors have been partly offset by European leadership in communications.",2006-08-31
Differences in economic policies and systems likely have accounted for some of the differences in the performance of productivity.,2006-08-31
"One leading explanation for the strong U.S. productivity growth is that labor markets in the United States tend to be more flexible and competitive, market characteristics that have allowed the United States to realize greater economic benefits from new technologies.",2006-08-31
"For example, some economists have argued that restrictions on land use and on shopping hours in Europe have impeded the development of ""big box"" retail outlets, reducing competition and denying European firms the economies of scale that have been important for productivity growth in the retail sector in the United States (Gordon, 2004).",2006-08-31
"Also, although it is not a feature unique to the United States, the increasing degree of openness of our economy to trade and foreign investment and the consequent exposure of U.S. companies to the rigors of international as well as domestic competition, may have promoted productivity growth.2 As a leading example, productivity gains in U.S. manufacturing--which is particularly subject to international competition--have been especially impressive in recent years, averaging, by one measure, about 6 percent per year over the past decade.3 A number of other explanations have been advanced for the relatively stronger performance of productivity in the United States in recent years, including international differences in management practices, the depth and sophistication of U.S. capital markets, more favorable attitudes toward competition and entrepreneurship in the United States, and the role of U.S. research universities in fostering innovation.4 Further study of national productivity differentials clearly is warranted.",2006-08-31
"The second productivity puzzle relates to the further acceleration in productivity that occurred earlier in this decade despite the decline in IT investment after 2000 and the rather modest recovery in recent years.5 Again, a number of explanations have been proposed, including business restructuring and an even more rapid pace of technical change and of the diffusion of technological advances.",2006-08-31
"It is interesting, however, that the recent episode is not the first time that we have seen productivity improvements lagging well behind investments in new technology.",2006-08-31
"Notably, computers were first commercialized in the 1950s, and personal computers began to come into widespread use in the early 1980s; but until the mid-1990s, these developments had little evident effect on measures of productivity.",2006-08-31
"Indeed, an oft-quoted quip by economist Robert Solow held that, as of the late 1980s, ""computers are everywhere except in the productivity statistics.""",2006-08-31
"In attempting to explain the tendency of productivity growth to lag behind investments in new technologies, economists have emphasized that much more than the purchase of new high-tech equipment is needed to achieve significant gains in productivity.",2006-08-31
"Case studies of individual industries show that the planning for technological modernization has not always been adequate, with the result that some purchases of high-tech equipment and software have not added much to productivity or profits.",2006-08-31
"Second, firmsâ€™ need to invest in intangible capital--and thus to divert resources from the production of market goods or services--helps to explain why measured output and productivity may decline or grow slowly during the period after firms adopt new technologies.",2006-08-31
"Finally, the concept of intangible capital may shed light on the puzzle of why productivity growth has remained strong despite the deceleration in IT investment.",2006-08-31
"Because investments in high-tech capital typically require complementary investments in intangible capital for productivity gains to be realized, the benefits of high-tech investment may become visible only after an extended period during which firms are making the necessary investments in intangibles.",2006-08-31
"Longer-Term Prospects for Productivity GrowthHistorical analyses of the sources of fluctuations in productivity growth are challenging, but not nearly so challenging as trying to predict how productivity will evolve in the future.",2006-08-31
"However, because the rate of productivity growth is a primary determinant of economic performance, policymakers have few options other than to try to forecast future gains in productivity.",2006-08-31
"For example, estimates of long-term productivity growth are needed to determine the rate of output growth that the economy can sustain in the long run without generating inflationary pressures.",2006-08-31
"The task of trying to predict the behavior of productivity in the medium-to-long run is complicated by the fact that productivity growth generally varies with the business cycle, tending to be below its longer-term trend when the economy is contracting and above that trend when the economy is in the early stages of an expansion (see Basu and Fernald, 2001, for a discussion).",2006-08-31
"(This well-documented pattern makes the strong growth of productivity during the early part of this decade, a period that featured a recession and generally slow growth, all the more remarkable.)",2006-08-31
Economists use statistical methods to try to abstract from cyclical influences to determine the longer-term trend in productivity.,2006-08-31
"As of a couple of years ago, the consensus among leading researchers was that productivity in the nonfarm business sector was likely to grow at about 2-1/2 percent per year in the longer term, close to the rate of productivity growth achieved during the 1995 to 2000 period (see, for example, Baily, 2003; Gordon, 2003; and Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh, 2004).",2006-08-31
"On the one hand, recent data revisions to the national income and product accounts have shown that productivity growth over the past few years was slightly weaker than we thought, leading some analysts to revise down their estimates of trend productivity growth about 1/4 percentage point or so per year.",2006-08-31
"On the other hand, the fact that productivity growth has remained solid in recent years increases confidence that a larger fraction of those productivity gains reflects longer-term developments and a smaller fraction reflects cyclical factors.",2006-08-31
"On net, the recent experience does not appear to require a significant rethinking of long-term productivity trends.",2006-08-31
"Indeed, recent estimates by leading economists continue to peg the expected longer-term rate of productivity growth at roughly 2-1/2 percent per year.7 Of course, as the saying goes, past returns do not guarantee future results, and not all the evidence supports this optimistic view of productivity trends.",2006-08-31
"For example, although spending on high-tech equipment and software has recovered noticeably from its recent lows, growth in IT spending remains well below the rates observed before the 2001 recession.",2006-08-31
"Some industry participants have suggested that less-rapid growth in IT spending may reflect the absence of major new business applications for IT--""killer apps,"" as they are called.",2006-08-31
"Moreover, until we have a more complete understanding of the factors behind productivity growth in the past five years, we should be cautious in drawing any strong conclusions about the future.",2006-08-31
"These caveats notwithstanding, a case can be made that the strong productivity growth of the post-1995 era is likely to continue for some time.",2006-08-31
"Notably, the price of computing power continues to fall sharply, having declined by nearly half in the five years between 2000 and 2005.",2006-08-31
"Moreover, whatever the pace of future technological progress, further diffusion of already-existing technologies and applications to more firms and industries should continue to increase aggregate productivity for a time.",2006-08-31
"I have focused today on how technological change and investment, both tangible and intangible, promote productivity growth.",2006-08-31

"September 30, 2022 Global Financial Stability Considerations for Monetary Policy in a High-Inflation Environment Vice Chair Lael Brainard At â€œFinancial Stability Considerations for Monetary Policy,â€ a research conference organized by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, New York, New York Share I want to start by thanking Anna Kovner, Rochelle Edge, and Bill Bassett for organizing this conference.",2022-09-30
"The current global environment highlights the importance of having strong analytic and empirical foundations to understand financial stability considerations for monetary policy, and the research presented today will help strengthen those foundations.1 The global environment of high inflation and rising interest rates highlights the importance of paying attention to financial stability considerations for monetary policy.",2022-09-30
"As monetary policy tightens globally to combat high inflation, it is important to consider how cross-border spillovers and spillbacks might interact with financial vulnerabilities.",2022-09-30
"Inflation is very high in the United States and abroad, and the risk of additional inflationary shocks cannot be ruled out.",2022-09-30
"In August, CPI (consumer price index) inflation on a 12-month basis was 8.3 percent in the United States, 9.9 percent in the United Kingdom, 9.8 percent in Sweden, 9.1 percent in the euro area, 8.7 percent in Mexico, 7.0 percent in Canada, and 5.7 percent in Korea.",2022-09-30
"Central banks facing high inflation are tightening monetary policy rapidly to damp demand and bring it into alignment with supply, which is constrained in a variety of sectors.",2022-09-30
"Russia's war against Ukraine has generated spikes in prices for energy, food, and agricultural inputs.",2022-09-30
"Most recently, inflation in Europe was pushed higher by Russia's cessation of natural gas deliveries through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, creating hardships for households and risking disruptions for some industries in the affected countries.",2022-09-30
"Separately, weather conditions in several areas, including China, Europe, and the United States, are exacerbating price pressures through disruptions to agriculture, shipping, and utilities.",2022-09-30
Many central banks around the world have pivoted monetary policy strongly in order to maintain anchored expectations and forestall second-round effects from high inflation becoming embedded in wage and price setting.,2022-09-30
"At a global level, monetary policy tightening is also proceeding at a rapid pace by historical standards.",2022-09-30
"While the effect on financial conditions tends to be immediate or even anticipatory, the effects on activity and price setting in different sectors may occur with a lag, with highly interest-sensitive sectors such as housing adjusting quickly and less rate-sensitive sectors such as consumer spending on services adjusting more slowly.",2022-09-30
"U.S. monetary policy tightening reduces U.S. demand for foreign products, thus amplifying the effects of monetary tightening by foreign central banks.",2022-09-30
The same is true in reverse: Tightening in large jurisdictions abroad amplifies U.S. tightening by damping foreign demand for U.S. products.,2022-09-30
"These spillovers across jurisdictions are present for decreases in the size of the central bank balance sheet as well as for increases in the policy rate.3 Some estimates suggest that the spillovers of monetary policy surprises between more tightly linked advanced economies such as the United States and Europe could be about half the size of the own-country effect when measured in terms of relative changes in local currency bond yields.4 In contrast, spillovers through exchange rate channels tend to go in opposite directions.",2022-09-30
"The Federal Reserve's broad nominal U.S. dollar index has appreciated over 10 percent year to date.5 On balance, dollar appreciation tends to reduce import prices in the United States.",2022-09-30
"But in some other jurisdictions, the corresponding currency depreciation may contribute to inflationary pressures and require additional tightening to offset.",2022-09-30
"For instance, in countries where sovereign or corporate debt levels are high, higher interest rates could increase debt-servicing burdens and concerns about debt sustainability, which could be exacerbated by currency depreciation.",2022-09-30
"For some emerging economies, high interest rates in combination with weaker demand in advanced economies could increase capital outflow pressures, particularly commodity importers facing higher commodity prices and weaker exchange rates.",2022-09-30
"Fiscal and monetary policy were both supportive in response to the pandemic, and both were naturally expected to reverse course as the recovery gathered steam.",2022-09-30
But the advent of the war has led to a significant hit to real incomes from large price increases in energy and other commodities in some of the most severely affected economies.,2022-09-30
"A European Central Bank analysis concluded that the release of capital buffers increased headroom for banks relative to not only their regulatory thresholds, but also their internal risk controls, and enabled banks to continue providing credit to households and businesses.6 And of course, monetary policy is focused on restoring price stability in a high-inflation environment.",2022-09-30
"As the program's first research paper illustrates, in circumstances in which macroprudential policy cannot on its own eliminate the amplification of shocks through financial vulnerabilities, in a low-inflation environment, monetary policy has been relatively more accommodative than would be prescribed by a conventional monetary policy rule in order to reduce the likelihood of adverse output and employment outcomes.7 But in a high-inflation environment, monetary policy is restrictive to restore price stability and maintain anchored inflation expectations.",2022-09-30
We engage in frequent and transparent communications with monetary policy officials from other countries about the evolution of the outlook in each economy and the implications for policy.,2022-09-30
"We meet regularly not only with monetary policy officials from different countries, but also with fiscal and financial stability officials in a variety of international settings, which helps us to take into account cross-border spillovers and financial vulnerabilities in our respective forecasts, risk scenarios, and policy deliberations.8 High inflation imposes significant hardships by eroding purchasing power, especially for those households that spend the greatest share of their incomes on essentials like food, housing, and transportation.9 Following a period where a combination of high demand and a lengthy sequence of adverse supply shocks to goods, labor, and commodities drove inflation to multidecade highs, monetary policymakers are taking a risk-management posture to guard against risks of longer-term inflation expectations moving above target, which would make it more difficult to bring inflation down.",2022-09-30
"In the modal outlook, monetary policy tightening to temper demand, in combination with improvements in supply, is expected to reduce demandâ€“supply imbalances and reduce inflation over time.10 The real yield curve is now in solidly positive territory at all but the very shortest maturities, and with the additional tightening and deceleration in inflation that is expected over coming quarters, the entire real curve will soon move into positive territory.",2022-09-30
It will take time for the full effect of tighter financial conditions to work through different sectors and to bring inflation down.,2022-09-30
Monetary policy will need to be restrictive for some time to have confidence that inflation is moving back to target.,2022-09-30
Proceeding deliberately and in a data-dependent manner will enable us to learn how economic activity and inflation are adjusting to the cumulative tightening and to update our assessments of the level of the policy rate that will need to be maintained for some time to bring inflation back to 2 percent.,2022-09-30
"Most obviously, at about 6 percent of gross domestic product, the current account deficit is now larger than it has ever been in our nation's history; that, by itself, attracts attention.",2005-04-20
"Also, because the current account deficit reflects the excess of our country's imports over our exports, the deficit's descent into record territory has helped crystalize fears that the economy is losing competitiveness and that U.S. jobs and incomes are suffering as a result.",2005-04-20
"Finally, the larger the current account deficit becomes, the greater the number of observers who believe that a correction, and one with significant implications for the U.S. economy, is imminent.",2005-04-20
"Although views differ as to when a correction will take place, nearly all agree that the current trajectory of the U.S. current account deficit is unsustainable.",2005-04-20
This consensus reflects the simple logic that the deficit is causing the net indebtedness of the U.S. economy to rise more rapidly than U.S. income.,2005-04-20
"If current account deficits continue to boost the negative international investment position, eventually the cost of servicing that position, which so far has been quite modest, would rise to an unsustainable level.",2005-04-20
"If nearly all observers agree that an adjustment of the U.S. current account deficit is inevitable, few agree on when the adjustment will occur and what will cause it to happen.",2005-04-20
Others place the onus of adjustment on foreign economies to boost lackluster domestic demand and increase their purchases of U.S. exports.,2005-04-20
A large part of the reason that people disagree about what will be needed to bring about current account adjustment is that they disagree about what has led the deficit to become so large in the first place.,2005-04-20
"If one believes that the expansion of the current account deficit has been caused by government policies, such as budget deficits, then it is natural to identify a reversal of those policies as the action that will bring about current account adjustment.",2005-04-20
"Conversely, if the current account deficit primarily reflects developments in the private sector, it is more likely that the marketplace will be the source of subsequent correction.",2005-04-20
"Surprisingly, researchers have made relatively few attempts to assess and compare the full range of explanations that have been proposed for the emergence of the large U.S. external deficit.1 In my remarks today, I would like to survey some of the factors that have been put forward to explain the deficit.",2005-04-20
"The proposed causes of the deficit are by no means mutually exclusive, of course.",2005-04-20
It is possible and even likely that the deficit is the outcome of several different developments.,2005-04-20
"From this perspective, the determinants of the current account balance are roughly the same as the determinants of the trade balance: exchange rates, prices, and incomes at home and abroad.",2005-04-20
"Accordingly, the widening of the U.S. current account deficit is frequently attributed to the strengthening of the dollar since the mid-1990s, which led U.S. imports to be cheaper measured in dollars and U.S. exports to be more expensive in foreign currency.",2005-04-20
"This definition highlights the decline in the ratio of national saving to GDP over the past ten years, even as investment rates have moved up a bit on balance, as the central cause of the widening of the U.S. current account deficit.",2005-04-20
"Finally, because any excess of national spending over income must be financed by foreigners, the current account deficit is equivalent to the net inflow of capital from abroad.",2005-04-20
This approach points to the surge of capital inflows into our economy as the key development underlying the emergence of the large external deficit.,2005-04-20
"These three approaches--the trade balance, the saving-investment balance, and net capital inflows--might, at first blush, appear to attribute the emergence of the large U.S. current account deficit to highly distinct factors.",2005-04-20
"In this example, the fundamental shock causing the current account deficit to widen is the change in investor expectations.",2005-04-20
"The other elements of the story--the inflow of capital, the strengthening of the dollar, and the movements in saving and investment rates--represent diverse aspects of the economy as they respond to that initial shock and lead, ultimately, to the larger deficit.",2005-04-20
"But any compelling explanation of the current account deficit must identify not merely the proximate influences on the deficit--be they exchange rates, capital flows, or aggregate saving and investment--but also the fundamental, underlying sources of the imbalance.",2005-04-20
"Explanations for the Large U.S. Current Account Deficit I would like now to address five different explanations for the large U.S. current account deficit, and even these do not exhaust the possibilities.",2005-04-20
"The first three explanations focus primarily on domestic developments: the fiscal deficit, an autonomous drop-off in private saving rates, and the surge in productivity growth.",2005-04-20
The remaining explanations encompass developments abroad as well: the slowdown in foreign demand and the apparent rise in global financial intermediation.,2005-04-20
"I will not discuss yet another factor that undoubtedly has contributed to the widening of the deficit--the rise in oil prices--but it is worth noting that our oil import bill has risen by about $110 billion, from $68 billion in 1999 to $180 billion in 2004, and most of this increase reflects higher oil prices.",2005-04-20
"Expansion of the fiscal deficit The view that the current account deficit arises from the widening U.S. budget deficit has received considerable attention of late and recalls the discussion of the mid-1980s, when the simultaneous emergence of fiscal and current account deficits in the United States gave rise to the ""twin deficits"" hypothesis.",2005-04-20
"Since the expansion of the fiscal deficit lowered public saving, the story runs, it must have lowered national saving and thus widened the current account balance to a similar extent.",2005-04-20
"In the more sophisticated version of the story, a larger fiscal deficit boosts domestic demand, pushing up domestic interest rates relative to foreign rates; this, in turn, attracts investors and raises the value of the dollar, thereby leading to a larger current account deficit.",2005-04-20
"In theory, the fiscal explanation of the current account deficit is entirely plausible.",2005-04-20
"Most notably, the fiscal factor cannot explain the widening of the trade deficit in the late 1990s, when the U.S. budget moved into surplus.",2005-04-20
"At the international level, countries such as Japan and Germany are running large current account surpluses even as their budget balances are substantially in deficit.",2005-04-20
"More generally, research into the determinants of current account balances has produced only mixed support for the linkage between fiscal and current account deficits.2 Why don't the reductions in public saving associated with widening fiscal deficits lead more consistently to higher current account deficits?",2005-04-20
"Most likely, larger budget deficits increase the government's draw on available credit and dampen private consumption and investment spending, thereby limiting the deterioration of the current account.",2005-04-20
"Accordingly, the effect on the trade deficit is estimated to have been fairly small.3 Rather than crowding out net exports, fiscal expansion appears to have primarily crowded out private investment and consumption.4 In sum, the recent experience both of the United States and of other countries, as well as the results of model simulations, lead me to conclude that the budget deficit has probably been only a small factor in the emergence of the large U.S. external imbalance.",2005-04-20
"Of course, even if it does not narrow the current account deficit by much, reducing the budget deficit would be highly desirable for other reasons: It would free up resources for private investment, and it would reduce the burden on future taxpayers of repaying the federal debt.",2005-04-20
"Decline in the private saving rate For observers who view the large current account deficit as an example of the profligacy of Americans, the sharp decline in private saving rates looms as large in their thinking as the sharp rise in the budget deficit.",2005-04-20
"On one hand, the decline in private saving could reflect a response to other developments in the economy--for example, a rise in the value of equity holdings and housing wealth, increases in expected future income, or declines in interest rates--and thus might not represent a fundamental cause of the U.S. current account deficit.",2005-04-20
The reason is virtually the same as in the case of a rise in fiscal deficits.,2005-04-20
"According to our simulation, high private consumption boosts GDP growth and--all else equal--forces up interest rates; although the rise in interest rates strengthens the dollar, it leads to much lower investment spending.",2005-04-20
"I should note, however, that just as a decline in the budget deficit is desirable even if it would not substantially reduce the trade deficit, a rise in private saving rates also would be helpful because it would strengthen private balance sheets and provide additional resources for investment and growth.",2005-04-20
"Productivity growth In both the fiscal story and the private-saving story, the large U.S. current account deficit implicitly is the outcome of a rise in consumption relative to income.",2005-04-20
"The third story I'd like to discuss highlights a more impressive achievement of the U.S. economy, the surge in labor productivity growth from about 1-1/2 percent annually in the two decades preceding 1995 to roughly 3 percent in the period since then.",2005-04-20
"First, higher productivity growth boosted perceived rates of return on U.S. investments, thereby generating capital inflows that boosted the dollar.",2005-04-20
"Finally, expectations of higher returns boosted equity prices, household wealth, and perceived long-run income, and so consumption rose and saving rates declined.",2005-04-20
"Under this explanation, all of these factors helped to widen the current account deficit.",2005-04-20
It links two key economic developments of the past decade: the rise in productivity growth and the widening of the current account deficit.,2005-04-20
"It also helps to explain several other important developments, including the fall in U.S. saving rates and the 1990s boom in asset prices.",2005-04-20
"In fact, a simulation of our macroeconomic model shown in figure 3 suggests that the surge in productivity growth, while hardly explaining all of the deterioration in the trade balance since the mid-1990s, accounts for more of that deterioration than do the public and private saving shocks combined.",2005-04-20
"Moreover, the effect of higher productivity growth on the trade balance could have been even larger than the simulation indicates because it likely worked through several channels that the model does not incorporate.",2005-04-20
"The simulation does not fully take into account the rise in stock prices and household wealth--and hence, consumption--that would have been spurred by expectations of higher productivity growth.",2005-04-20
"Also, because the simulation does not fully account for the effect of enhanced perceptions of equity returns on exchange rates, it does not produce the rise in the dollar that, in all likelihood, resulted from the productivity surge.",2005-04-20
Slump in foreign domestic demand I would like to turn now to developments at the global level that may have helped to widen the U.S. current account deficit.,2005-04-20
Domestic demand growth has slumped in many foreign economies because of varying combinations of an increase in saving rates and a decline in investment.,2005-04-20
"This weakening of foreign spending has enhanced the supply of capital available to the United States, put downward pressure on U.S. interest rates, and put upward pressure on the dollar.",2005-04-20
"As I said before, I like the U.S. productivity surge story and find it compelling.",2005-04-20
"However, I also like the foreign demand slump story, and I find it compelling.",2005-04-20
Some of the largest industrial economies in the world--Japan and the euro area--have been running current account surpluses while experiencing very subdued growth.,2005-04-20
"In the developing world, the East Asian economies that went through financial crises in the late 1990s have seen a plunge in their investment rates even as their saving rates have remained extremely high; the weakness in domestic demand has likely motivated the authorities in these countries to keep their exchange rates competitive to promote export-led growth, a strategy that has also contributed to the U.S. external deficit.5 More generally, since 1999, the developing countries as a whole have been running current account surpluses--with the industrial countries, mainly the United States, necessarily running current account deficits--for the first time in many years.",2005-04-20
"Additionally, by depressing perceived rates of return abroad, the weakness in foreign demand explains a considerable portion of the run-up in the dollar, as shown in figure 4.",2005-04-20
"Finally, weaker U.S. net exports reduce overall U.S. activity and depress interest rates a bit, thus raising domestic consumption and investment spending.",2005-04-20
"Taken together, these factors contribute importantly to the widening of the trade deficit since the mid-1990s.",2005-04-20
Improvements in global financial intermediation Another global factor that has been cited as contributing to the widening of the U.S. current account deficit has been an increase in global financial intermediation.,2005-04-20
"This hypothesis is supported by the reduced correlation of national saving and investment rates in recent years, which implies that savings increasingly are being used to finance investment in other countries.6 Of course, an increased capacity of global financial markets to finance current account deficits does not, by itself, mean that it is the United States that would tap this enlarged capacity.",2005-04-20
"So, how much of the enlargement of the U.S. current account deficit can we attribute to improved international intermediation?",2005-04-20
"As a step in this direction, however, we reasoned that any reduction in home bias by foreign investors toward the United States would show up as a decline in the risk premium these investors demand for holding U.S. assets.",2005-04-20
"This decline in the risk premium, in turn, would lead to a greater demand for U.S. assets and a rise in the dollar.",2005-04-20
"Based on an estimate of the decline in the risk premium that occurred since the mid-1990s, our macroeconomic model suggests, as shown in figure 5, that the decline contributed importantly to the rise in the dollar, and, therefore, to the widening of the trade deficit.",2005-04-20
"Putting It All Together I would now like to step back and consider the relative contributions to the trade deficit of each of the explanations I have discussed, as shown in figure 6.7 To the extent that the contributions of these shocks are reasonably well measured by the macroeconomic model simulations, the most important message I draw from them is that no single factor constitutes a dominant explanation of the deterioration in the U.S. current account balance.",2005-04-20
"That said, our model accords the greatest roles to increased productivity growth, which has made the United States a magnet for foreign saving, and to the slump in foreign domestic demand, which has led to an excess of saving in those economies.",2005-04-20
"The narrowing of the risk premium on dollar assets appears to explain a bit less of the widening of the trade deficit, with the loosening of fiscal policy and reduction of private saving making still-smaller contributions.",2005-04-20
"Attributing the historically unprecedented widening of the trade deficit, as well as the similarly unprecedented rise in our international indebtedness, to the coincidence of many random and unrelated developments would not make for a very satisfying story.",2005-04-20
"However, my sense is that many of the developments that contributed to the U.S. trade deficit are not unrelated and may be part of a broader evolution of the global economy.",2005-04-20
"Improvements in financial markets, both at home and abroad, may have amplified the effects on the U.S. current account of other developments I have discussed, including the U.S. productivity surge and the perceived weakening of foreign investment opportunities.",2005-04-20
It is even possible that the expansion of the U.S. budget deficit would have been smaller had policymakers perceived global financial markets to be less willing to finance the gap.,2005-04-20
The view that the current account deficit stems from economic developments that are varied and yet intertwined has important implications for how the deficit will be corrected.,2005-04-20
"Such a view suggests to me, first, that government policies such as budget-cutting or encouragement of private saving are unlikely, by themselves, to correct the current account deficit, much as they might be desirable for other reasons.",2005-04-20
Such policies probably do not address all or even most of the root causes of the current account deficit.,2005-04-20
"Reducing our budget deficit can ease the adjustment process by releasing resources that can be channeled into higher net exports, so that a reduced trade deficit does not require a curtailment of investment.",2005-04-20
"Appropriate macroeconomic and structural policies in many economies can contribute to the private-sector adjustment process by fostering an environment of innovation, increased productivity and more-rapid growth of domestic demand.",2005-04-20
"Recognizing the role for public policy, the Group of Seven industrial nations recently stated that vigorous action is needed to address global imbalances and foster growth.",2005-04-20
"The primary impetus toward adjustment of the U.S. current account deficit, when it occurs, likely will come from private markets.",2005-04-20
"Here, however, the multiplicity of factors underlying the large U.S. current account deficit raises questions about how that adjustment will come about.",2005-04-20
"Some of the developments that may have supported the expansion of the U.S. current account deficit might reverse themselves--foreign domestic demand could recover, U.S. private saving rates could rise.",2005-04-20
"And some of the factors that boosted the U.S. trade deficit, such as higher productivity growth or financial innovations that support greater spending, may show up more fully in foreign economies.",2005-04-20
"Notably, all of these developments would take time to restrain the deficit, and any one of them, by itself, might have only a small effect.",2005-04-20
"A final possibility is that, as U.S. deficits widen and foreign claims on the United States mount, actions by investors to re-balance their accumulation of assets could lead to changes in exchange rates, interest rates, and other asset prices that might contribute to a reversal of the deficit.",2005-04-20
"Work by Athanasios Orphanides and other economists has helped to heighten economistsâ€™ awareness of this issue by exploring the extent to which faulty estimates of potential output may have contributed to the monetary policy errors of the 1970s.3 However, academic economists may still not fully appreciate the degree to which measurement uncertainty bedevils policymaking.",2006-12-01
"These difficulties are especially pronounced at times like the present, when resource utilization and the rate of economic growth are probably not far from their long-run potential, inflation trends may be shifting, and policy interest rates are close to their historical averages in real (that is, inflation adjusted) terms.",2006-12-01
Consider our estimates of real economic activity.,2006-12-01
"For example, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released revised estimates in late July that showed persistently slower growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) in recent years.",2006-12-01
These more pessimistic data were then followed over the balance of the summer and into the fall by stronger-than-expected readings on current labor market conditions as well as by the announcement of upcoming benchmark revisions that will raise the level of payroll employment 1/2 percent.,2006-12-01
"Taken together, these revisions have had important implications for our estimates of employment, productivity, labor costs, and related statistics.",2006-12-01
Price data are subject to several measurement problems besides the well-known issues of quality changes and appropriate weights.,2006-12-01
"For example, a significant portion of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index is based on imputations of prices for important categories of household purchases, such as banking services, rather than on direct observations of market prices.",2006-12-01
"This ""nonmarket"" component of the index is hard to replicate, tends to move in an erratic manner from month to month, and is subject to considerable revision--factors that reduce the usefulness of the overall index as a short-run indicator of price pressures.",2006-12-01
"For example, the data in hand last week showed hourly compensation rising almost 7 percent over the past four quarters based on the national accounts measure, but only 3 percent as measured by the employment cost index.",2006-12-01
"Perhaps the most intractable problems surround the measurement of such key concepts as the equilibrium real interest rate, trend productivity, and potential output.",2006-12-01
"As I just hinted, recent revisions to GDP and to labor input would seem to point to downward adjustments to estimates of trend productivity, but sorting out trend from cycle in the new data has been a challenge.",2006-12-01
"These expectations are undoubtedly important in householdsâ€™ estimates of their permanent income and hence in determining aggregate demand; indeed, econometric analysis suggests that these survey measures can help in predicting consumer spending.",2006-12-01
Similar difficulties arise when considering firmsâ€™ assessment of future demand.,2006-12-01
"In the case of inflation expectations, we do have a larger number of indicators at our disposal.",2006-12-01
Measures of inflation compensation derived from nominal and indexed Treasury yields provide information that addresses some of the weaknesses in survey measures.,2006-12-01
"For example, investors have strong incentives to ensure that inflation compensation reflects their beliefs about the prospects for a specific index, the consumer price index (CPI), over a fixed time horizon.",2006-12-01
"Even here, however, we encounter important technical difficulties: These inflation compensation measures are ""contaminated"" both by an inflation risk premium and by differences in liquidity between the markets for nominal and indexed Treasury securities.",2006-12-01
"More fundamentally, even a ""rational"" forecast of inflation from financial markets provides only part of the information needed to form monetary policy because it gives only a sense of where inflation is expected to go, not why it is going there.",2006-12-01
"Of course, asset prices are a category for which expectations are extremely important and for which data are available on a large scale.",2006-12-01
"The term structure of interest rates, the spread between private and public yields on debt, equity prices, and the exchange value of the dollar--to name a few--are of first-order macroeconomic importance and are directly related to expectations.",2006-12-01
"As an example, consider house prices.",2006-12-01
"Some commentators have suggested that, over the past several years, households extrapolated previous gains in house prices in thinking about the likely return to real estate and, in doing so, created a speculative bubble that pushed home prices significantly above their ""fundamental"" level.4 However, others have argued that the rapid rise in home prices was fully justified by strong income growth and low interest rates.5 Distinguishing between these alternatives would be aided both by better measures of householdsâ€™ expectations regarding the appreciation of their homes and by a better grasp of the determinants of those expectations.",2006-12-01
"As I have noted elsewhere, our lack of understanding of the dynamics of asset price determination is a significant hurdle to giving them extra weight in setting monetary policy.6 Much of my discussion regarding expectations has so far focused on measurement issues, but the question of why economic conditions unfold as they do also raises a critically important question: How are expectations formed?",2006-12-01
But this form of rational expectations seems to be of limited usefulness when the question at hand is the evolution of expectations and their effect on activity and inflation.,2006-12-01
"For example, rational expectations models will often rule out the possibility that learning errors in householdsâ€™ expectations of future labor market conditions can have an independent effect on aggregate demand.",2006-12-01
"And, these models usually simply assume that ""irrational"" movements in asset prices are not an important factor in the macroeconomic outlook.",2006-12-01
"One prominent example is the work in behavioral finance on how alternative assumptions regarding rationality can affect predictions for asset prices and saving behavior; another is the growing literature on the interaction of learning, inflation dynamics, and monetary policy.",2006-12-01
"To illustrate the effect of this sort of uncertainty on policy, consider the interaction of inflation dynamics and expectations--a subject of major study over the past thirty years.",2006-12-01
"At one end of the spectrum of possible views is a policymaker who thinks that inflation expectations are rational and consistent with a New-Keynesian model of the economy, in which intrinsic sources of inflation persistence are not especially important.",2006-12-01
"In this case, the policymaker might not be too worried that, say, a string of adverse supply shocks would create a severe conflict between the goals of price stability and of full employment.",2006-12-01
"According to this worldview, if people expect the central bank to follow a price-stabilizing strategy, and the central bank ratifies that belief, then any undesired movement in inflation will be quite short lived.",2006-12-01
And restoring price stability in such a world will likely involve little cost in terms of real activity.,2006-12-01
"Under this alternative worldview, a string of adverse supply shocks is dangerous because it has the potential to cause rising inflation to become embedded in expectations.",2006-12-01
"Should this shift in expectations occur, the central bank would face a persistent inflation problem, one whose correction would likely require a prolonged period of tight monetary policy.",2006-12-01
"In this less comfortable world, restoring price stability can involve a painful process of slow growth and elevated unemployment.",2006-12-01
"Of course, these considerations are more than a theoretical curiosity and help to explain the intense focus of central banks on inflation expectations.",2006-12-01
The marked rise in energy prices over the past few years led until recently to a rate of overall consumer price inflation notably above core inflation.,2006-12-01
"However, the available measures of expectations--whether from surveys or financial markets--have shown longer-term expectations increasing very little, if at all, throughout this period, providing some assurance about the inflation outlook.",2006-12-01
"As a policymaker, I would have been more confident in my ex ante judgment about the risk of expectations moving higher if we had had a better understanding of the determinants of expectations regarding prices and of the links between these expectations and the subsequent performance of inflation.",2006-12-01
"The literature on this topic extends at least as far back as William Brainardâ€™s original paper on uncertainty and policy almost forty years ago.7 Brainardâ€™s analysis showed that if policymakers are uncertain about how real activity and inflation will be affected over time by monetary actions, they should be less aggressive in responding to changes in economic conditions than would be the case if they knew the true model of the economy.",2006-12-01
"Subsequent research has largely supported Brainardâ€™s conclusions and highlighted a corollary to it: Monetary policy should not respond too strongly to any one economic indicator, as the relationship between that indicator and the goals of policy--price stability and full employment--often differs across alternative models in important ways.",2006-12-01
"Central bankers around the world certainly seem receptive to taking a gradualist and cautious approach to policy under most circumstances, as indicated by (among other things) their apparent tendency to smooth interest rates.",2006-12-01
"During this period, incoming data suggested that trend productivity might be accelerating.",2006-12-01
"However, the evidence for this unexpected development was far from conclusive; moreover, the short-run implications for inflation and employment of a sustained pickup in productivity growth were ambiguous.",2006-12-01
"Staff analysis at the time supported Brainardâ€™s conclusion that the appropriate response to heightened uncertainty about the economyâ€™s true productive potential would be to reduce the importance of the estimated output gap in setting policy.8 Whatever the persuasiveness of this analysis, the FOMC did respond in a restrained manner to unusually robust real economic activity--as I believe was appropriate in light of the low and stable inflation that followed.",2006-12-01
"For example, it may be necessary for monetary policy to respond to what might be called ""tail events,"" along the lines suggested by recent work on ""robust control.""",2006-12-01
"For example, in 2003 the FOMC noted that a continued fall in inflation would be unwelcome largely because such an eventuality might potentially lead to persistently weak real activity with interest rates stuck at zero.",2006-12-01
"For example, the simulations routinely consider alternative characterizations of such key aspects of the economy as the expectations formation process, wealth effects, and the sensitivity of inflation to changes in resource utilization and monetary policy.",2006-12-01
"Nevertheless, studies suggest that the decisions reached by committees are usually superior to those produced by individuals.10 In any event, I know that the heterogeneous viewpoints expressed by my fellow Committee members are intellectually stimulating and that they spur me to improve my own thinking about the economy and about the best course for monetary policy.",2006-12-01
I am pleased that this year the focus of the conference is on two of my long-standing professional interestsâ€”financial markets and monetary policy.,2019-11-12
"In particular, I would like to address an issue that has been much in focusâ€”the decline in long-term interest ratesâ€”highlighting the role of monetary policy in contributing to that decline and the implications of that decline for the conduct of monetary policy.",2019-11-12
The Decline in Long-Term Interest Rates and the Role of Monetary Policy One of the most remarkable and fundamental changes in the global financial landscape over the past three decades has been the steady and significant decline in global sovereign bond yields.,2019-11-12
"To understand and interpret this decline, it is useful to think of the yield on a nominal 10-year bond as the sum of two components: investors' expectation over the next 10 years of the average level of short-term interest rates plus a term premium.",2019-11-12
The term premium is the additional compensationâ€”relative to investing in and rolling over short-maturity billsâ€”that bondholders require for assuming the risk of holding a long-duration asset with greater exposure to interest rate and inflation volatility.,2019-11-12
"In this case, which is relevant today in the United States and some other countries, the exposure to interest rate and inflation volatility embedded in a long-maturity bond is more than offset by the potential value of the bond in hedging other risks, such as equity risk.2 The expectation of the average level of future short-term interest rates can, in turn, be decomposed into the expectation of average future real interest rates and the expectation of average future inflation rates.",2019-11-12
"Performing this standard decomposition reveals that the decline in long-term rates reflects declines in all three components: expected real rates, expected inflation, and the term premium (figure 2, ""Yield Decomposition"").",2019-11-12
"With respect to expected real short-term interest rates, one reason investors expect lower future short-term interest rates is that neutral interest rates appear to have declined worldwide and are expected to remain low.",2019-11-12
This concept of a neutral level for short-term real interest rates is referred to in the academic literature as r* and corresponds to the rate consistent with a level of aggregate demand equal to and growing in pace with aggregate supply at an unchanged rate of inflation.,2019-11-12
"Policymakers and academics alike, including myself, have spent considerable time exploring the reasons for and ramifications of the decline in r* across countries.3 For example, many have pointed to slowing population growth and a moderation in the pace of technological change as consistent with a lower level of r*.4 Changes in risk tolerance and regulations have led to an increase in savings and in the demand for safe assets, pushing down yields on sovereign bonds.5 Importantly, economic theory suggests and empirical research confirms that there is a significant common global component embedded in individual country r*s (figure 3, ""Estimates of r*"").6 This common factor driving individual country r*s not only reflects the influence of common global shocks affecting all economies in a similar way (for example, a slowdown in global productivity and the demographics associated with aging), but also results from international capital flows that respond to and, over time, tend to narrow divergences in rates of return offered across different countries.",2019-11-12
"In addition to the decline in r* around the world, lower long-term bond yields also reflect the influence of the initial downshift and ultimate anchoring of inflation expectations in many countries after the mid-1990s.",2019-11-12
"Unlike the decline in r*, which primarily reflects fundamental ""real"" factors that are outside the control of a central bank, the decline and ultimate anchoring of inflation and inflation expectations in both major and many emerging economies were the direct consequence of the widespread adoption and commitment to transparent, flexible inflation-targeting monetary policy strategies.",2019-11-12
"For example, in the United States, after the collapse of Bretton Woods, inflation spiraled upward, hitting double-digit rates in the 1970s and early 1980s.",2019-11-12
"But by the mid-1980s, the back of inflation had been broken (thank you, Paul Volcker), and total personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation averaged less than 4 percent from 1985 to 1990.",2019-11-12
"Following the 1990â€“91 recession, inflation fell further, and, by the mid-1990s, the conditions for price stability in the United States had been achieved (thank you, Alan Greenspan).",2019-11-12
"From the mid-1990s until the Great Recession, U.S. PCE inflation averaged about 2 percent.",2019-11-12
"And, of course, this step-down in inflation has been global, with the other major advanced economies experiencing a similar shift down (table 1, ""Average Inflation Rates"").",2019-11-12
Many major emerging market economies as well have seen a remarkable and very welcome decline in average inflation rates as a result of adopting and delivering on credible inflation-targeting polices.,2019-11-12
"To the extent that the step-down in inflation is expected to persist, which appears to be the case, long-term yields have reflected this decline one-for-one.",2019-11-12
"However, not only has the average level of inflation fallen, but inflation has also become more stable.",2019-11-12
"After considerable volatility in the 1970s and 1980s, over the past few decades, inflationâ€”especially core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy pricesâ€”has, with rare exceptions, moved only within a relatively narrow range in many countries despite significant swings in the prices of oil and other commodities, recessions, the Global Financial Crisis, and unprecedented monetary policy actions.",2019-11-12
"Reflecting this, inflation volatility, as measured by the standard deviation in quarterly inflation rates, has declined.",2019-11-12
"(See table 2, ""Standard Deviation of Annualized Quarterly Headline Inflation Rates."")",2019-11-12
What has been behind this global decline in inflation volatility?,2019-11-12
"I would argue, as have many others, that monetary policy played a key role in reducing not only the average rate of inflation, but also the volatility of inflation.7 Inflation-targeting monetary policy can plausibly influence the variance of inflation through several channels.",2019-11-12
"For example, in a textbook DSGE (dynamic stochastic general equilibrium) model (Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (CGG), 1999) featuring a central bank that implements policy via a Taylor-type rule, the equilibrium variance of inflation will be lower the more aggressively the central bank leans against exogenous shocks that push inflation away from target.",2019-11-12
"So even if the variance of inflation shocks is constant, the variance of inflation itself will be an endogenous function of monetary policy.",2019-11-12
Another related channel through which monetary policy can influence the variance of inflation is by changing the equilibrium persistence of inflation deviations from target.,2019-11-12
"In the textbook CGG model (1999), augmented with a hybrid Phillips curve that features an inertial backward-looking component, the equilibrium persistence of inflation is an endogenous function of the monetary policy rule such that the more aggressively the central bank leans against exogenous shocks that push inflation away from target, the less persistent are inflation deviations from target in equilibrium.",2019-11-12
"In the simple case in which equilibrium inflation is a first-order autoregressive process (as it is in the CGG (1999) model under optimal policy), the equilibrium unconditional variance of inflation is monotonic in inflation persistence for any given constant variance of inflation shocks.",2019-11-12
"Of course, non-monetary factors may also have contributed to a lower variance of inflation.",2019-11-12
"For example, the variance of underlying exogenous shocks to aggregate supply and demand may have fortuitously and coincidentally fallen in tandem with the adoption of inflation targeting in many countries.",2019-11-12
"Decomposing the factors that drive equilibrium term premiums is an active area of academic research, and I will not attempt to summarize or synthesize this vast literature.8 But I would like to emphasize what seems to me to be three contributors to the decline in the term premium in the United States and perhaps in other countries as well.9 First, the decline in inflation volatility has almost certainly been important in driving the term premium on nominal bonds lower.",2019-11-12
"The real ex-post payoff from holding a nominal bond to maturity is directly exposed to price-level risk, and thus, all else being equal, a decline in inflation volatility makes the real purchasing power of the bond's payoff less risky.",2019-11-12
"Through this channel, the decline in inflation volatility should be reflected in a smaller inflation risk premium in nominal bond yields, which is exactly what is estimated in the Kim, Walsh, and Wei (2019) yield curve model (figure 4, ""Term Premium Decomposition"").",2019-11-12
"Indeed, this yield curve model attributes around 100 basis points of the decline in the U.S. 10-year nominal term premium since the early 1990s to a decline in the inflation risk premium.",2019-11-12
A third contributor to a lower U.S. term premium is much less widely appreciated than lower inflation volatility and LSAPs.,2019-11-12
"As such, we would expect the equilibrium yield on bonds to be lower than otherwise, as investors should bid up their price to reflect their value as a hedge against equity risk (relative to their value when the bond beta to stocks was positive).",2019-11-12
"This paper develops and estimates a habit persistence consumption asset pricing model in which the sign of the equilibrium covariance between equity and bond returns depends on the reduced-form correlation between inflation and the output gap, the correlation between the federal funds rate and the output gap, as well as the equilibrium persistence of inflation.",2019-11-12
"CPV document in U.S. data, for a sample spanning 1979:Q3 to 2011:Q4, that (1) the correlation between inflation and the output gap changed sign from negative to positive; that (2) the correlation between the federal funds rate and the output gap changed sign, also from negative to positive; and that (3) the evidence of the sign change becomes statistically significant beginning in the late 1990s.",2019-11-12
CPV also document that the transitory component of inflation becomes much less persistent after the estimated break in their sample.,2019-11-12
"The CPV paper is agnostic as to why the reduced-form correlation between inflation and the output gap and that between the federal funds rate and the output gap both change sign in their sample, but the authors do demonstrate that in their asset pricing model, these reduced-form sign changes are sufficient to generate the sign change in the correlation between equity and bond returns that we observe in the data.",2019-11-12
"I, myself, believe that the change in the U.S. monetary policy regime that began in 1979 under Paul Volcker and that was extended by Alan Greenspan in the 1990s very likely contributed to the change in the sign of the correlation between inflation and the output gap as well as the change in sign of the correlation between the federal funds rate and the output gap that we observe in the data (Clarida, Galí, and Gertler, 2000).",2019-11-12
"These are the sorts of patterns that a simple model of optimal monetary policy would produce when starting from an initial condition in which inflation is well above the (implicit) target, as was the case in 1979.",2019-11-12
"High initial inflation triggers a policy response for the central bank to push up the real policy rate well above inflation in order to push output below potential, which, via the Phillips curve, will, over time, lower inflation toward the target.",2019-11-12
"If this policy succeeds ex post, inflation expectations become anchored at the new lower level of inflation, and policy can, then, respond to demand shocks by adjusting real rates pro-cyclically, the opposite of what is required when initial inflation is too high and inflation expectations are not anchored.13 Inflation will also be pro-cyclical with well-anchored inflation expectations if demand shocks dominate and inflation expectations remain anchored.",2019-11-12
"Implications for Monetary Policy: The Federal Reserve's Framework Review By lowering expected inflation, by anchoring expected inflation at a low level, by contributing to a reduction in the volatility of inflationâ€”and thus a reduction in the inflation risk premiumâ€”and by contributing to creating a hedging value of long-duration sovereign bonds, inflation-targeting monetary policy has lowered equilibrium bond yields relative to equilibrium short rates substantially compared with the experience of the 1970s and early 1980s.",2019-11-12
But what does this mean for monetary policy?,2019-11-12
"The reality of low neutral rates and equilibrium bond yields has motivated us at the Federal Reserve to take a hard look this year at our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices.",2019-11-12
"The first question is, ""Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to reverse past misses of the inflation objective?""",2019-11-12
Central banks are generally believed to have effective tools for preventing persistent inflation overshoots.,2019-11-12
"But persistent inflation shortfalls, such as those associated with the ELB, carry the risk that longer-term inflation expectations become anchored below the stated inflation goal.16 At our September Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, we discussed options for mitigating ELB risks, including ""makeup"" strategies in which policymakers would promise to make up for past inflation shortfalls with a sustained accommodative stance of policy intended to generate higher future inflation.17 Such strategies provide accommodation at the ELB by keeping the policy rate low for an extended period.",2019-11-12
Makeup strategies may also help anchor inflation expectations more firmly at 2 percent than would a policy strategy that does not compensate for past inflation misses.,2019-11-12
"We are also considering whether our existing monetary policy tools are adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability, or whether our toolkit should be expanded and, if so, how.",2019-11-12
One of these challenges is how best to conduct monetary policy in the new world of low equilibrium interest rates.,2019-11-12
"Stepping back, earlier today, speakers at this conference discussed the challenges of making monetary policy in an uncertain and risky environment.",2019-11-12
"In my remarks, I have laid out an important example of the interaction of the macroeconomy, monetary policy, and the market response to risk.",2019-11-12
"As keen observers of local economies, the directors here and elsewhere contribute vitally to the formulation of monetary policy by offering important insights absent, by definition, from even the most careful analysis of aggregate data.",2000-12-08
"At the Federal Reserve, our monetary policy is guided by the dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices.",2022-03-21
"From that standpoint, the current picture is plain to see: The labor market is very strong, and inflation is much too high.",2022-03-21
"My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation.",2022-03-21
"There is an obvious need to move expeditiously to return the stance of monetary policy to a more neutral level, and then to move to more restrictive levels if that is what is required to restore price stability.",2022-03-21
We are committed to restoring price stability while preserving a strong labor market.,2022-03-21
"At our meeting that concluded last week, we took several steps in pursuit of these goals: We raised our policy interest rate for the first time since the start of the pandemic and said that we anticipate that ongoing rate increases will be appropriate to reach our objectives.",2022-03-21
"These actions, along with the adjustments we have made since last fall, represent a substantial firming in the stance of policy with the intention of restoring price stability.",2022-03-21
"In my comments today, I will first discuss the economic conditions that warrant these actions and then address the path ahead for monetary policy.",2022-03-21
"The Labor Market Is Very Strong and Extremely Tight To begin with employment, in the last few years of the historically long expansion that ended with the arrival of the pandemic, we saw the remarkable benefits of an extended period of strong labor market conditions.",2022-03-21
"Employment growth powered through the difficult Omicron wave, adding 1.75 million jobs over the past three months.",2022-03-21
"The unemployment rate has fallen to 3.8 percent, near historical lows, and has reached this level much faster than anticipated by most forecasters (figure 1).",2022-03-21
"While disparities in employment remain, job growth has been widespread across racial, ethnic, and demographic groups.",2022-03-21
"By many measures, the labor market is extremely tight, significantly tighter than the very strong job market just before the pandemic.",2022-03-21
"There are far more job openings going unfilled today than before the pandemic, despite today's unemployment rate being higher.",2022-03-21
"It is worth considering why the labor market is so tight, given that the unemployment rate is actually higher than it was before the pandemic.",2022-03-21
"One explanation is that the natural rate of unemployment may be temporarily elevated, so wage pressure is greater for any given level of unemployment.",2022-03-21
"Over time, we might expect these factors to fade, reducing pressure in the job market.",2022-03-21
"Total demand for labor, measured by total employment plus posted job openings, has substantially recovered and far exceeds the size of the workforce.",2022-03-21
Increases in labor force participation often substantially lag declines in unemployment.,2022-03-21
"Overall, the labor market is strong but showing a clear imbalance of supply and demand.",2022-03-21
"Our monetary policy tools cannot help with labor supply in the near term, but in a long expansion, the factors holding back supply will likely ease.",2022-03-21
"In the meantime, we aim to use our tools to moderate demand growth, thereby facilitating continued, sustainable increases in employment and wages.",2022-03-21
"The Inflation Outlook Has Deteriorated Significantly Turning to price stability, the inflation outlook had deteriorated significantly this year even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",2022-03-21
The rise in inflation has been much greater and more persistent than forecasters generally expected.,2022-03-21
"For example, at the time of our June 2021 meeting, every Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participant and all but one of 35 submissions in the Survey of Professional Forecasters predicted that 2021 inflation would be below 4 percent.",2022-03-21
"Inflation came in at 5.5 percent.2 For a time, moderate inflation forecasts looked plausibleâ€”the one-month headline and core inflation rates declined steadily from April through September.",2022-03-21
"But inflation moved up sharply in the fall, and, just since our December meeting, the median FOMC projection for year-end 2022 jumped from 2.6 percent to 4.3 percent.",2022-03-21
"In my view, an important part of the explanation is that forecasters widely underestimated the severity and persistence of supply-side frictions, which, when combined with strong demand, especially for durable goods, produced surprisingly high inflation.",2022-03-21
"The pandemic and the associated shutdown and reopening of the economy caused a serious upheaval in many parts of the economy, snarling supply chains, constraining labor supply, and creating a major boom in demand for goods and a bust in services demand.",2022-03-21
The combination of the surge in goods demand with supply chain bottlenecks led to sharply rising goods prices (figure 4).,2022-03-21
"Prices soared across the vehicles sector as booming demand was met by a sharp decline in global production during the summer of 2021, owing to shortages of computer chips.",2022-03-21
"Production remains below pre-pandemic levels, and an expected sharp decline in prices has been repeatedly postponed.",2022-03-21
"Many forecasters, including FOMC participants, had been expecting inflation to cool in the second half of last year, as the economy started going back to normal after vaccines became widely available.3 Expectations were that the supply-side damage would begin to heal.",2022-03-21
"Schools would reopenâ€”freeing parents to return to workâ€”and labor supply would begin bouncing back, kinks in supply chains would begin resolving, and consumption would start rotating back to services, all of which could reduce price pressures.",2022-03-21
"The Policy Response As the magnitude and persistence of the increase in inflation became increasingly clear over the second half of last year, and as the job market recovery accelerated beyond expectations, the FOMC pivoted to progressively less accommodative monetary policy.",2022-03-21
I believe that these policy actions and those to come will help bring inflation down near 2 percent over the next 3 years.,2022-03-21
"Thus, my main message today is that, as the outlook evolves, we will adjust policy as needed in order to ensure a return to price stability with a strong job market.",2022-03-21
How will fallout from the invasion of Ukraine affect the economy and monetary policy?,2022-03-21
"In addition to the direct effects from higher global oil and commodity prices, the invasion and related events are likely to restrain economic activity abroad and further disrupt supply chains, which would create spillovers to the U.S. economy.",2022-03-21
We might look to the historical experience with oil price shocks in the 1970sâ€”not a happy story.,2022-03-21
"Fortunately, the United States is now much better situated to weather oil price shocks.4 We are now the world's largest producer of oil, and our economy is significantly less oil intensive than in the 1970s.",2022-03-21
"Today a rise in oil prices has mixed effects on the economy, lowering real household incomes and thus demand, but raising investment in drilling over time and benefiting oil-producing areas more generally.",2022-03-21
"Second, how likely is it that monetary policy can lower inflation without causing a recession?",2022-03-21
Our goal is to restore price stability while fostering another long expansion and sustaining a strong labor market.,2022-03-21
"In the FOMC participant projections I just described, the economy achieves a soft landing, with inflation coming down and unemployment holding steady.",2022-03-21
"Growth slows as the very fast growth from the early stages of reopening fades, the effects of fiscal support wane, and monetary policy accommodation is removed.",2022-03-21
"I believe that the historical record provides some grounds for optimism: Soft, or at least soft-ish, landings have been relatively common in U.S. monetary history.5 In three episodesâ€”in 1965, 1984, and 1994â€”the Fed raised the federal funds rate significantly in response to perceived overheating without precipitating a recession (figure 6).6 In other cases, recessions chronologically followed the conclusion of a tightening cycle, but the recessions were not apparently due to excessive tightening of monetary policy.",2022-03-21
"And monetary policy is often said to be a blunt instrument, not capable of surgical precision.",2022-03-21
It is worth noting that today the economy is very strong and is well positioned to handle tighter monetary policy.,2022-03-21
"Finally, what will it take to restore price stability?",2022-03-21
The ultimate responsibility for price stability rests with the Federal Reserve.,2022-03-21
Price stability is essential if we are going to have another sustained period of strong labor market conditions.,2022-03-21
We will take the necessary steps to ensure a return to price stability.,2022-03-21
"Our monetary policy framework, as embodied in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, emphasizes that having longer-term inflation expectations anchored at our longer-run objective of 2 percent helps us achieve both our dual-mandate objectives.",2022-03-21
"In the recent period, short-term inflation expectations have, of course, risen with inflation, but longer-run expectations remain well anchored in their historical ranges (figure 7).",2022-03-21
"The added near-term upward pressure from the invasion of Ukraine on inflation from energy, food, and other commodities comes at a time of already too high inflation.",2022-03-21
"In normal times, when employment and inflation are close to our objectives, monetary policy would look through a brief burst of inflation associated with commodity price shocks.",2022-03-21
"However, the risk is rising that an extended period of high inflation could push longer-term expectations uncomfortably higher, which underscores the need for the Committee to move expeditiously as I have described.",2022-03-21
"But, to end where I began, inflation is much too high.",2022-03-21
"We have the necessary tools, and we will use them to restore price stability.",2022-03-21
"This evening, I begin with two questions that are central to the economy's prospects and the challenges facing monetary policy.",2000-06-06
"And second, What role, if any, do traditional economic principles, specifically the role of supply and demand, continue to play in today's economy?",2000-06-06
"Nevertheless, I can't stress too often that we care about the balance of supply and demand in the economy because we care about promoting both full employment and price stability and, thereby, maximum sustainable growth.",2000-06-06
We want to contain inflation because doing so has been crucial for sustaining the economic expansion that we now enjoy and for providing an environment conducive to private decision-making and longer-term planning so critical for taking advantage of new technological opportunities.,2000-06-06
"Containing inflation has, I am sure, contributed to the length and strength of the economic expansion we now enjoy--an expansion, by the way, that is the longest in our nation's history.",2000-06-06
And I need not remind you that the low inflation we now have was dearly purchased in the late 1970s and early 1980s with the highest interest rates since the Civil War and the highest unemployment rate since the Depression.,2000-06-06
"Precisely because inflation is the critical issue that hangs in the balance of new economy possibilities and old economy regularities, I will offer some observations on how I read the recent data on labor compensation and price inflation.",2000-06-06
My comments are in the spirit of inflation reports that many central banks with explicit inflation targets regularly issue.,2000-06-06
"Before proceeding, let me remind you that the views expressed on the outlook and on monetary policy are my own.",2000-06-06
"The narrow version defines the new economy in terms of two principal developments: first, an increase in the economy's maximum sustainable growth rate and, second, the spread and increasing importance of information and communications technology.",2000-06-06
"The latter is presumably the major contributor to the acceleration in labor productivity that, in turn, is the principal source of the increase in trend growth in real GDP.",2000-06-06
"A third, and perhaps related, development is a possible increase in the economy's sustainable utilization rates, specifically a decline in the non-accelerating-inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU).",2000-06-06
"In the case of the United States, however, there is little doubt that the underlying rate of productivity growth has increased significantly in the second half of the 1990s.",2000-06-06
"From 1974 to 1995, labor productivity advanced at about an annual rate of 1-1/2 percent.",2000-06-06
Productivity then accelerated to a rate of about 2-1/2 percent in the second half of the 1990s.,2000-06-06
"This acceleration appears to have been spread out over the second half of the 1990s, so that the average rate over that period understates the rate of productivity growth at the end of the period.",2000-06-06
Productivity typically grows faster than its longer-term trend when GDP growth is rising and falls below trend when GDP decelerates.,2000-06-06
This pattern simply reflects lags in adjusting employment to changes in GDP growth.,2000-06-06
"Measuring productivity growth over a long period, such as 1974 to 1995, effectively eliminates this shorter-run component of productivity growth.",2000-06-06
"And because GDP growth was relatively stable during the second half of the 1990s, shorter-run dynamics appear not to have been an important contributor to the higher productivity growth in that period.",2000-06-06
"Moreover, careful econometric attempts to isolate the short-run dynamic and longer-run structural components generally have concluded that structural productivity growth increased from about 1-1/2 percent in the earlier periods to around 2-1/2 percent to 3 percent by the end of the decade.",2000-06-06
That would put the sustainable rate of GDP growth up to 3-1/2 percent to 4 percent.,2000-06-06
"Still there is considerable uncertainty about trend productivity growth, including whether it might be accelerating, especially given the brief period over which higher and rising structural productivity growth has been experienced.",2000-06-06
Important questions about the measurement of productivity aggravate this uncertainty.,2000-06-06
And there is also considerable uncertainty about how long the higher productivity growth will persist.,2000-06-06
"For example, periods of more rapid productivity growth might be best understood as a transition to a higher level of productivity that is based on major technological developments.",2000-06-06
The persistence question is more important for assessing longer-run fiscal prospects--including the solvency of Social Security--than to monetary policy decisions that are made in the context of a one to two year period.,2000-06-06
"Using the neoclassical model, and disaggregating capital into information and communications technology and other capital, Dan Sichel and Steve Oliner of the Board staff decomposed productivity growth into contributions from capital deepening (the growth arising from an increase in the ratio of capital to labor) and multifactor productivity growth (the growth in output that cannot be accounted for by increases in labor and capital inputs) and into the contributions from the use of information technology and from increased efficiency in the production of computers.",2000-06-06
"According to their estimates, a bit less than half of the productivity acceleration was due to a pickup in capital deepening and a bit more than half to an increase in multifactor productivity growth.",2000-06-06
"More than 90 percent of capital deepening came from information and communications technology equipment, and nearly 40 percent of the increase in multifactor productivity growth came from increased efficiency in the production of computers and embedded semiconductors.",2000-06-06
"Altogether, therefore, information and communications technology accounted for slightly more than two-thirds of the increase in productivity.1 Besides the direct effects of information and communications technology through capital deepening and the more efficient production of computers, this technology may also indirectly raise productivity through spillover effects.",2000-06-06
"In a traditional growth accounting setup, these effects would show up in multifactor productivity growth.",2000-06-06
"Some back-of-the-envelope calculations by Oliner and Sichel suggest that such effects have been quite small to date, though the explosive growth of e-commerce, particularly in the business-to-business segment, suggests a potential for a more important contribution over time.",2000-06-06
"But do these developments--specifically higher trend productivity growth and the spread of information and communications technology--alone justify the ""new economy"" label?",2000-06-06
"Specifically, we could increase the estimate of trend productivity growth, based on higher multifactor productivity and capital deepening--both due in large part to information and communications technology--and have a fairly good explanation of the remarkable performance of the U.S. economy.",2000-06-06
"This approach would explain the recent productivity performance without denying the continued relevance of old economy regularities, including the role of supply and demand imbalances as a source of inflation dynamics.",2000-06-06
"Heck, throw out supply and demand.",2000-06-06
"For example, do these developments increase the competitiveness of markets, and, if so, how does this affect inflation dynamics?",2000-06-06
They appear to increase the speed and effectiveness of price discovery.,2000-06-06
What does this imply for pricing leverage and inflation dynamics?,2000-06-06
"Do they result in rapidly growing sectors dominated by increasing returns to scale, where increases in demand lower cost and hence prices?",2000-06-06
"These are all provocative and important questions, but none of these developments, in my view, are powerful enough at this moment to support the notion that labor and other utilization rates can rise ever higher without triggering accelerating prices--the broader version of the ""new economy.""",2000-06-06
"For my part, I accept the proposition that there has been a significant improvement in underlying productivity growth in the United States, that it is very closely tied to improvements in information and communications technology, and that it is likely to spread around the world.",2000-06-06
"Welcome Back Supply and Demand I was startled by the bold title of an article that appeared in The Wall Street Journal on December 31, 1999: ""So Long, Supply and Demand.""",2000-06-06
"I was rather certain that confidence in supply and demand would make a comeback, and so I was delighted to see the front-page story in The Wall Street Journal on May 16, 2000--the day of the last FOMC meeting.",2000-06-06
"The title this time was ""Firms Start Raising Prices, Stirring Fears of Inflation Fighters,"" and it began: ""Even in the new economy, at least one old rule still applies: If demand exceeds supply for long enough, sellers will raise prices.""",2000-06-06
So let me count the ways that supply and demand help us to understand the recent experience and the challenges facing monetary policy today.,2000-06-06
"First, a productivity shock affects aggregate demand as well as potential supply and may initially have an even larger effect on demand than on supply.",2000-06-06
"In early discussions about the productivity shock, the emphasis was, not surprisingly, exclusively on its supply-side implications--specifically a faster rate of productivity growth and hence of sustainable GDP growth.",2000-06-06
The natural corollary seemed to be that a faster growth of supply than of demand would be a powerful disinflationary force.,2000-06-06
"But during the period over which productivity has accelerated, demand has grown faster than potential supply.",2000-06-06
"The demand effects--to the extent that they are directly related to the productivity shock--likely reflect the more favorable investment opportunities, the effect of expected profitability on equity prices and hence household wealth and consumption, and the effect of the increase in expected future labor income on current consumption.",2000-06-06
"Demand, it appears, received an additional boost over this period from a run-up in equity prices that the higher productivity growth alone could not fully account for.",2000-06-06
"The balance between supply and demand can be inferred from movements in utilization rates, specifically in the unemployment rate.",2000-06-06
"When actual output is expanding at the same pace as potential, the unemployment rate will be stable.",2000-06-06
"When output growth outpaces the growth of potential, the unemployment rate declines.",2000-06-06
And the unemployment rate has declined almost 0.4 percentage points a year for the past four years.,2000-06-06
This translates into excess demand growth of 0.75 to 1 percentage point relative to potential supply growth.,2000-06-06
The second insight--and enduring old economy wisdom--is that a proximate source of changes in inflation is an imbalance between the levels of aggregate supply and aggregate demand.,2000-06-06
This can be expressed as an imbalance between actual and potential output or as a divergence of the unemployment rate from the NAIRU.,2000-06-06
"The imbalance between the growth rates of aggregate supply and demand is, of course, the source of changes in the balance between the levels of aggregate demand and supply.",2000-06-06
But inflation is related directly to the levels not to the growth imbalance.,2000-06-06
"And, even in the new economy, excess aggregate demand ultimately drives up inflation.",2000-06-06
Do we have excess aggregate demand?,2000-06-06
"In my judgment, we have excess demand conditions in the labor market.",2000-06-06
"The central tendency for my estimate of the NAIRU is in the range of 5 percent to 5-1/4 percent, compared to the 4.1 percent current unemployment rate.",2000-06-06
"This uncertainty has been, in my view, an important consideration in the way monetary policy has responded to recent economic developments.",2000-06-06
"Obviously, whether the NAIRU is closer to 4 percent or to 5 percent affects the difficulty associated with rebalancing supply and demand to contain the risk of higher inflation.",2000-06-06
But why has inflation remained moderate if there is persistent excess demand in the labor market?,2000-06-06
This is still another supply and demand story.,2000-06-06
The economy is subject to two fundamental types of aggregate economic shocks: supply shocks and demand shocks.,2000-06-06
These two types of shocks give rise to different challenges for monetary policy.,2000-06-06
Supply shocks come in two varieties: relative price shocks (such as changes in the relative price of oil) and productivity shocks.,2000-06-06
"Earlier in this episode, the economy benefited from a series of favorable relative price shocks and, throughout the last several years, has been adjusting to an increase in productivity growth.",2000-06-06
Both of these developments have had a temporary disinflationary effect.,2000-06-06
"Together they suppressed inflation for a while, countering the potential inflationary consequences of the progressive increase in aggregate demand relative to potential supply.",2000-06-06
"Once the disinflationary impetus from supply shocks begins to dissipate or to reverse, the inflationary consequences of the supply-demand balance will begin to show through.",2000-06-06
The disinflationary effect of an increase in productivity growth begins to dissipate once productivity growth stabilizes at a higher level.,2000-06-06
"So unless productivity accelerates further, its disinflationary effect should continue to erode for a time.",2000-06-06
"When favorable supply shocks dominate, growth in demand is stimulated and utilization rates rise, but inflation tends to moderate.",2000-06-06
"The result is offsetting implications for the setting of the nominal funds rate and, thus, monetary policy may be left with little work to do.",2000-06-06
"This accounts for the relative inactivity of monetary policy from 1996 through the end of 1999, at which point the federal funds rate was within 1/4 percentage point of where it was at the beginning of the period.",2000-06-06
"But once the disinflationary effects of the favorable supply shocks dissipate or reverse, the challenge is more like one that accompanies demand shocks.",2000-06-06
"Excess demand, evidenced by utilization rates above sustainable levels, will put upward pressure on inflation, and monetary policy must restrain aggregate demand to bring it into balance with potential supply to avoid rising inflation.",2000-06-06
A Brief Inflation Report But is there any evidence that inflation pressures are in fact building?,2000-06-06
"Of course, overall inflation has clearly increased significantly over the last year.",2000-06-06
"The consumer price index, for example, has increased at a 3 percent rate over the last twelve months, compared with a 2.3 percent rate over the previous twelve months.",2000-06-06
Similar trends are evident in the PCE and in the GDP price index.,2000-06-06
But this increase in overall inflation reflects mainly the rise in oil prices over 1999 and into 2000.,2000-06-06
"Assuming that oil prices stabilize, the effect will dissipate, and overall inflation will return toward, and indeed dip slightly below, the core rate (the rate net of food and energy prices).",2000-06-06
"So, looking forward, the core inflation rate is the more important consideration.",2000-06-06
These numbers suggest that inflation pressures remain well contained.,2000-06-06
"But digging a little deeper, the evidence, in my judgment, supports the conclusion that core inflation has moved modestly higher over the last six to nine months.",2000-06-06
"First, the introduction of a methodological change in measuring the CPI in January 1999 lowered CPI inflation relative to the earlier period.",2000-06-06
"As a result, on a methodologically consistent basis, core CPI inflation in the last twelve months has actually been up a couple tenths of a percentage point.",2000-06-06
"But, more important, the higher-frequency data provides some evidence of a rising trend in core inflation.",2000-06-06
"For example, at an annual rate, core CPI inflation is 2.4 percent over the last nine months, 2.5 percent over the last six months and 3.2 percent over the last three months.",2000-06-06
So I conclude that the underlying trend for core CPI inflation has moved up to close to 2-1/2 percent today.,2000-06-06
The core PCE and the GDP price indexes also have accelerated over the last six to nine months.,2000-06-06
The higher core inflation could be explained by a pass-through to the core of earlier increases in oil prices.,2000-06-06
"However, whether such a pass-through leads to a one-time increase in the price level or to continuing inflation depends on whether or not monetary policy accommodates the higher inflation.",2000-06-06
"Whether such accommodation occurs, in turn, depends on how policy deals with the excess demand that will be felt in the first instance in wage pressures in a very tight labor market.",2000-06-06
"For example, consider the trend in year-over-year growth rates for the three key measures.",2000-06-06
"For the employment cost index, the trend is decidedly up; for average hourly earnings, however, the year-over- year growth rate has been flat; and for compensation per hour in the productivity and costs report, the trend is actually down.",2000-06-06
"Until the May employment report, the recent monthly data clearly pointed to an acceleration in average hourly earnings--given the 4-1/2 percent rate posted over the first four months of the year after a 3-1/2 percent rate over 1999.",2000-06-06
"There are, in my judgment, some grounds for discounting the productivity and cost measure.",2000-06-06
"Even if the evidence for an acceleration in nominal labor compensation were more definitive, the implications for inflation are not altogether straightforward.",2000-06-06
"If the trend in the growth of labor compensation is upward, it could be a response to the uptick in overall inflation last year or to overly tight labor markets or to a catch-up to the higher rate of productivity growth.",2000-06-06
"Just as the slowing in overall inflation in 1997 and 1998 contributed to a moderation in nominal wage demands, the higher overall inflation in 1999 and 2000 would be expected to boost nominal wage demands.",2000-06-06
But any rebound in nominal labor compensation could also reflect a catch-up to higher productivity growth.,2000-06-06
"If nominal compensation is just matching the higher productivity growth, this source of acceleration in nominal compensation would not itself be inflationary.",2000-06-06
The slow initial response of nominal compensation to higher productivity growth is the source of the temporary disinflationary effect of a productivity shock.,2000-06-06
"Therefore, once the catch-up is under way, this disinflationary impetus gradually disappears.",2000-06-06
"And at this point, the pass-through from higher inflation and the effect of tight labor markets have no offset and will begin to dominate.",2000-06-06
So even the catch-up story plays a role in the upward trend in inflation.,2000-06-06
A second reason that nominal compensation is so difficult to factor into an inflation forecast is that compensation practices are changing.,2000-06-06
"Stock options are incorporated, based on gains upon exercising the options, in the productivity and cost measure, but not in the ECI.",2000-06-06
"So what is the outlook for inflation, and how does it relate to the interplay of new economy forces and traditional supply and demand considerations?",2000-06-06
"In my judgment, we took the benefits of both the earlier favorable relative price shocks and the productivity shock, partly in a decline in the unemployment rate below the NAIRU and partly in a decline in inflation.",2000-06-06
"This is not a statement about what policymakers planned, but rather about what evolved as we responded to unexpected developments in inflation and growth.",2000-06-06
"At any rate, we could have taken more of the benefits of the favorable supply shocks in lower inflation, but given that inflation was already so low, the combination we ended up with seems, after the fact, to have been reasonable.",2000-06-06
"At some point, however, when the temporary disinflationary impetus of the favorable supply developments dissipate, not only will there be some rebound in inflation, but unless a transition is made back to sustainable utilization rates, there will be a risk of a continuous upward movement in inflation.",2000-06-06
"During that transition, at least some of the earlier decline in core inflation will be reversed.",2000-06-06
"To be sure, it has been difficult to be precise about both sustainable utilization rates and the path of inflation because of uncertainties about the NAIRU and other aspects of inflation dynamics in a period of significant structural change.",2000-06-06
"Given our uncertainty about sustainable utilization rates and wage-price dynamics in the new economy, however, policy setting must remain flexible and responsive to new information about both the supply and the demand sides of our economy.",2000-06-06
Conclusion: The Challenge Facing Monetary Policy This analysis suggests that monetary policy does face a challenge--rebalancing aggregate supply and demand to contain the risk of higher inflation.,2000-06-06
The major question in this respect is whether slowing the economy to trend alone will get the job done or whether we need a period of below-trend growth to unwind an imbalance between the levels of aggregate demand and supply.,2000-06-06
"If the task is only slowing the economy to trend--because the NAIRU turns out to be close to 4 percent--the task is not as challenging, and inflation will remain stable near current levels.",2000-06-06
"If the NAIRU turns out to be closer to 5 percent, then the task is more demanding, and growth will have to slow to below trend for a while, and inflation is likely to rise somewhat further until the rebalancing is complete.",2000-06-06
"If successful, in either scenario, the payoff from monetary restraint will be both to contain the risk of higher inflation and to extend the life of this remarkable expansion.",2000-06-06
"First, we are now in a high-growth rather than a low-growth economy.",2000-06-06
"Even if we have to slow growth to below trend for a period, the resulting growth rate could remain well above the average growth rate over the previous 25 years and still get the job done.",2000-06-06
"If oil prices have now at least peaked--and, better yet, if they decline at least modestly over the next year and a half, as suggested by expectations reflected in futures markets--the upward impetus to overall inflation from oil prices will dissipate or even reverse.",2000-06-06
"In this case, overall inflation is likely to decline next year, and this decrease could help moderate the rise in core inflation into the following year.",2000-06-06
"Third, long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored, reflecting considerable confidence that monetary policy will contain any threat of higher inflation.",2000-06-06
This should damp the rise in inflation in the short term.,2000-06-06
"Fourth, monetary policy got a head start on containing inflation by beginning to tighten last June, before the signs of building inflation pressures were evident.",2000-06-06
"Fifth, the tighter monetary policy is now contributing to a less accommodative set of financial conditions throughout the economy--including higher short- and long-term private interest rates, lower equity prices, a stronger dollar, and more stringent lending conditions at banks.",2000-06-06
"If these tighter financial conditions remain in place, we will have made significant progress in establishing the foundation for slower growth.",2000-06-06

"September 27, 2007 Globalization, Macroeconomic Performance, and Monetary Policy Governor Frederic S. Mishkin At the Domestic Prices in an Integrated World Economy Conference, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. Share In recent years, globalization has become one of the hottest topics, not only for the general public but also for central bankers.1 Some commentators have gone so far as to claim that greater openness of economies to flows of goods, services, capital, and businesses from other nations invalidate traditional economic models of inflation, which take little account of globalization.",2007-09-27
"In the long run, monetary policy strives to achieve price stability, which contributes to maximum sustainable employment and economic growth.",2007-09-27
"In the shorter run, we at the Federal Reserve aim to achieve our dual mandate of not only stabilizing prices but also reducing the volatility of output and employment around their maximum sustainable levels.",2007-09-27
"Globalization affects the ability of monetary policy makers to stabilize prices and output in two ways: (1) through its effects on the behavior of inflation and output and (2) through its effects on the ways in which monetary policy influences inflation and output--that is, on the monetary transmission mechanism.",2007-09-27
I will look at each in turn and will then use the analysis to address another important issue for monetary policy makers: Has globalization been a key driver of improvements in inflation performance and the decline in inflation that we have been seeing throughout the world?,2007-09-27
"Globalization and Inflation We should never forget Milton Friedman's adage that ""inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.""",2007-09-27
"In the long run, as long as a central bank has an independent monetary policyâ€‘â€‘that is, it is not locked into a fixed-exchange-rate regime in which its hands are tiedâ€‘â€‘the rate of inflation is determined by monetary policy.",2007-09-27
"Globalization, however, can have an effect on the incentives for central banks to control inflation and, more directly, on inflation developments in the short and medium runs.",2007-09-27
"Kenneth Rogoff (2003) argues that globalization has led to greater price flexibility, which has reduced the ability of central banks to use inflation surprises to boost output.",2007-09-27
"In other words, the Phillips curve will steepen, making more stark the short-run tradeoff between unemployment and inflation.",2007-09-27
"As a result, central banks will be less tempted to try to exploit the short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, as in the Barro-Gordon (1983) model, and so will be less likely to pursue overly expansionary monetary policy that leads to higher inflation.",2007-09-27
"A major problem with Rogoff's argument is that instead of steepening with the growth of globalization in recent years, the Phillips curve has become flatter, not only in the United States but also in many other countries throughout the world (Borio and Filardo, 2007; International Monetary Fund, 2006; Ihrig and others, 2007; Pain, Koske, and Sollie, 2006).",2007-09-27
"Globalization, because it makes markets more competitive, also has the potential to spur productivity growth.",2007-09-27
Higher productivity growth can lead to a reduction in inflation because it directly lowers prices if monetary policy does not become more expansionary.,2007-09-27
"In addition, such growth makes it easier for the monetary authorities to allow inflation to fall because output growth will continue to be rapid when inflation is declining.",2007-09-27
"This may have been the situation in the United States in the late 1990s, when productivity growth surged and inflation declined.",2007-09-27
"The rise in productivity growth during this period in the United States, however, did not seem to spill over to other industrial countries, a result that cast doubt on whether globalization has indeed accelerated the transmission of productivity growth across national borders.",2007-09-27
"Because globalization increases competition, it can also reduce markups (price over costs), and this reduction may lead to lower relative prices, as is argued by Chen, Imbs, and Scott (2007).",2007-09-27
"However, lower markups and price levels should have only transitory effects on inflation.",2007-09-27
"These effects from the greater price flexibility and increased competition in domestic markets that have arisen from globalization, while theoretically plausible, are often at variance with salient features of the world economy, and so they do not explain why inflation has declined in recent years.",2007-09-27
"If China were truly exporting deflation, the effect should be evident primarily in the behavior of import prices.",2007-09-27
"Research at the Federal Reserve Board by Kamin, Marazzi, and Schindler (2006) estimates that purchases of manufactures from China have lowered U.S. import price inflation roughly 1 percentage point annually over the past decade, a decline that has led to a short-run lowering of consumer price inflation of about one-tenth of 1 percentage point and a somewhat larger effect over the longer term.",2007-09-27
"Research at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) by Pain, Koske, and Sollie (2006) arrives at a similar estimate of the effect of trade in manufactures with developing countries on U.S. inflation: negative 0.2 to negative 0.3 percentage point.",2007-09-27
"At the same time, the additional demand for primary commodities by developing Asia, especially China and India, is putting upward pressure on global prices of these goods.",2007-09-27
"During 2004-06, the region accounted for about 40 percent of the global growth in demand for oil and more than 70 percent of the growth in demand for copper and zinc.",2007-09-27
"The global commodities boom, which has been stimulated by the emergence of the Chinese and Indian economies on the international scene, has been an important offset to the deflationary effects from their low-priced goods and services.",2007-09-27
"Analysis by the Board's staff, which weights the negative effect on U.S. inflation from cheaper manufactures against the positive effect from higher commodity prices, finds that the net effect in recent years could go either way but in any case is probably quite small.",2007-09-27
"Looking back before the recent boom in commodities prices, the staff's best estimate is that China's and India's entrance on the global trading scene has had a small negative effect on inflation.",2007-09-27
"Laurence Ball (2006) makes an important point that cheaper imports from places like China lower relative prices for imported goods but ultimately do not affect inflation, which is the change in overall prices.",2007-09-27
"Following the argument made by Milton Friedman (Friedman, 1974), Ball points out that for every decline in the relative price of one good or service in a price index like the consumer price index (CPI), there is by definition a rise in the relative price of some other good or service.",2007-09-27
Any pattern of relative-price changes is compatible with a particular level of the inflation rate.,2007-09-27
"What determines the overall inflation rate is not relative prices for one category of goods and services but rather the balance between overall demand and supply in the economy, which ultimately is influenced by monetary policy.",2007-09-27
Ball therefore takes the view that cheap imports from China and other low-wage economies should not affect inflation.,2007-09-27
I would not go as far as Ball does for the reason that changes in relative prices in an important category of goods and services could affect inflation for a considerable period of time.,2007-09-27
"Nevertheless, his argument, as well as the research cited earlier, indicates that many of the exaggerated claims that globalization has been an important factor in lowering inflation in recent years just do not hold up.",2007-09-27
It is thus of concern to monetary policy makers because it can affect both output volatility and our forecasts of the economy.,2007-09-27
"Research at the Federal Reserve Board (Ihrig and others, 2007) documents that net exports tend to be negatively correlated with domestic demand and thus stabilize output; other research (Guerrieri, Gust, and López-Salido, 2007) finds that shocks to domestic demand move output less in more open economies.",2007-09-27
"That said, as I have emphasized in my speeches and writings (Mishkin, 2006a, b; Mishkin, 2007b), I strongly believe that globalization is and has been a key factor in promoting economic growth.",2007-09-27
"Globalization and the Monetary Transmission Mechanism Four questions naturally arise when we consider whether globalization has changed the monetary transmission mechanism, that is, how monetary policy influences inflation and output: (1) Has globalization led to a decline in the sensitivity of inflation to domestic output gaps (the difference between actual and potential output) and thus to domestic monetary policy?",2007-09-27
"(2) Are foreign output gaps playing a more prominent role in the domestic inflation process, so that domestic monetary policy has more difficulty stabilizing inflation?",2007-09-27
(3) Can domestic monetary policy still control domestic interest rates and so stabilize both inflation and output?,2007-09-27
"(4) Are there other ways, besides possible influences on inflation and interest rates, in which globalization may have affected the transmission mechanism of monetary policy?",2007-09-27
Has globalization led to a decline in the sensitivity of inflation to domestic output gaps (the difference between actual and potential output) and thus to domestic monetary policy?,2007-09-27
"In recent years, we have clearly witnessed a decline in the sensitivity of inflation to the domestic output gap (a flattening of the Phillips curve) in the United States and other advanced countries (Borio and Filardo, 2007; International Monetary Fund, 2006; Ihrig and others, 2007; Pain, Koske, and Sollie, 2006).",2007-09-27
"Globalization might make inflation less responsive to rising domestic resource utilization because households and businesses can go outside the country to buy goods and services, so there will be less pressure for domestic prices to rise.",2007-09-27
"Although this story is a plausible one, research at the Federal Reserve Board and elsewhere finds no evidence that the flattening of the Phillips curve reflects the process of increasing trade integration (Ihrig and others, 2007; Ball, 2006; Wynne and Kersting, 2007).2 Rather than globalization being an important factor leading to flatter Phillips curves, I would argue (as in Mishkin, 2007a) that flatter Phillips curves are the direct result of better monetary policy that has anchored inflation expectations.",2007-09-27
"Because monetary authorities are focusing more on establishing a stronger nominal anchor, a rise in resource utilization will not lead to a rise in expected inflation.",2007-09-27
"Instead, households and businesses will expect monetary authorities to take the necessary steps to ensure that the economy will not overheat, and, as a result, they will not push for higher prices and wages.",2007-09-27
"Not only is this explanation for decreased sensitivity of inflation to output gaps more consistent with empirical evidence (see Mishkin, 2007a; Roberts, 2006), but it is more consistent with the timing of when Phillips curves became flatter.",2007-09-27
"In the United States, Phillips curves started to flatten in the 1980s, well before the recent surge of globalization but just after inflation expectations started to become anchored.",2007-09-27
"Are foreign output gaps playing a more prominent role in the domestic inflation process, so that domestic monetary policy has more difficulty stabilizing inflation?",2007-09-27
"As economies have become more open, foreign factors may have become more important in the determination of domestic inflation.",2007-09-27
"Research at the Bank for International Settlements (Borio and Filardo, 2007) seems to provide evidence that foreign resource slack has superseded domestic slack as a key determinant of domestic inflation.",2007-09-27
"Using more-conventional specifications of Phillips curves, the research at the Federal Reserve Board (Ihrig and others, 2007) and the OECD (Pain, Koske, and Sollie, 2006), as well as Ball (2006), finds that foreign output gaps are not important determinants of domestic inflation.",2007-09-27
"However, foreign factors could more plausibly play a role in the inflation process through import prices.",2007-09-27
"As economies become more open and imports play a bigger role in the economy, consumer prices may become more sensitive to import prices.",2007-09-27
"Indeed, CPI inflation does appear to have become more sensitive to import prices over time, both in the United States and in other OECD countries (Pain, Koske, and Sollie, 2006).3 Can domestic monetary policy still control domestic interest rates and so stabilize both inflation and output?",2007-09-27
"In principle, the increasing global integration of financial markets, by reducing the scope for individual central banks to control domestic interest rates, could hamper the ability of monetary policy to stabilize prices and economic activity.",2007-09-27
"Indeed, some evidence appears to suggest that foreign factors influence interest rates; for example, the global saving glut does seem to have led to somewhat lower long-term interest rates by reducing term premiums (Warnock and Warnock, 2006).",2007-09-27
"More generally, research points to important linkages between U.S. and foreign interest rates and other asset prices (Ehrmann, Fratzscher and Rigobon, 2005; Faust and others, 2007).",2007-09-27

"Are there other ways, besides possible influences on inflation and interest rates, in which globalization may have affected the transmission mechanism of monetary policy?",2007-09-27
"The preceding discussion might lead to the conclusion that globalization has not had important effects, either on the behavior of inflation or the ability of monetary policy to affect the economy.",2007-09-27
One of the key transmission channels of monetary policy is the exchange rate.,2007-09-27
"A tightening of monetary policy, for example, raises U.S. interest rates relative to those abroad, thereby inducing upward pressure on the foreign exchange value of the dollar.",2007-09-27
"An appreciation of the dollar, in turn, restrains exports (because the price of U.S. goods rises when measured in foreign currencies) and stimulates imports (because imports become cheaper in dollar terms).",2007-09-27
The resulting decrease in net exports implies a reduction in aggregate demand.,2007-09-27
"In addition, an appreciation of the dollar that leads to a decline in import prices also helps restrain overall U.S. inflation.",2007-09-27
"By expanding the share of tradable goods and services in the economy, globalization might increase the role of the exchange rate as a transmission channel of monetary policy and could reduce the role of the interest rate channel.",2007-09-27
"The larger the share of imports and exports in the economy, the greater the change in net exportsâ€‘â€‘and, hence, in the contribution of net exports to gross domestic product (GDP) growthâ€‘â€‘for a given change in the exchange rate.",2007-09-27
"In addition, the larger the share of imports in the economy, the larger should be the effect on overall CPI inflation of a given change in import prices when the exchange rate changes.4 (This effect is explicitly incorporated in Federal Reserve staff models of U.S. inflation, which weight import prices by the share of imports in the consumption basket.)",2007-09-27
"By the same token, the effect of the interest rate channel on overall economic activity may be diminished by greater trade integration as changes in domestic demand are offset by induced changes in imports.",2007-09-27
"Guerrieri, Gust, and López-Salido (2007), for example, find that shocks to domestic demand move output less in more-open economies because they lead to larger offsetting movements in the trade balance.",2007-09-27
"Supporting this result, Ihrig and others (2007) conclude that correlations between real GDP growth and real domestic demand growth have declined in recent decades in the United States and several other industrial economies.",2007-09-27
"In addition to increasing the sensitivity of the economy to changes in exchange rates, globalization may have increased the sensitivity of exchange rates to monetary policy.",2007-09-27
An implication of this financial globalization is that demand for domestic and foreign assets is likely to have become more sensitive to international differences in perceived rates of return.,2007-09-27
"Accordingly, monetary policy actions may now exert more influence on exchange rates than was the case when markets were less tightly integrated and assets of different countries were perceived to be less substitutable for each other.",2007-09-27
This linkage between globalization and the effect of monetary policy on exchange rates is somewhat speculative but represents a worthwhile avenue for further research.,2007-09-27
Why Has Inflation Declined in Recent Years?,2007-09-27
What does all the preceding analysis tell us about why we have had better inflation performance in recent years?,2007-09-27
I don't know of anyone who would have predicted twenty years ago that inflation would be so low and stable in so many countries.,2007-09-27
Has globalization been an important part of the story of inflation's remarkable decline in recent years?,2007-09-27
Inflation has come down in the old-fashioned way.,2007-09-27
Tighter monetary policy and a commitment to price stability by central banks throughout the world have led to lower inflation and an anchoring of inflation expectations.,2007-09-27
These policies have had huge benefitsâ€‘â€‘not only the achievement of low and stable inflation but also an improvement in the overall performance of the economy.,2007-09-27
"Globalization, however, may have helped reduce inflation in more-subtle ways.",2007-09-27
"By fostering increased interactions among central banks, academics, and the public in many different countries, globalization has helped spread a common culture that stresses the benefits of achieving price stability.",2007-09-27
The resulting increased focus on price stability has been a key reason for the reduction of inflation worldwide.,2007-09-27
"Conclusion The increasing integration of global product, labor, and financial markets has the potential to significantly alter the behavior of the economy, a development that could complicate the task of monetary policy.",2007-09-27
"""* Introduction* Marvin Goodfriend answers the question in his title with a ""yes"" and, in the process, has provided us with an excellent foundation for a discussion of inflation targeting in the United States.",2003-03-24
I completely agree with the fundamental premise that low inflation is an indispensable long-run focus of the central bank.,2003-03-24
"Low and stable rates of inflation allow economies to function more effectively, and having inflation expectations anchored facilitates countercyclical monetary policy and improves the trade-off between output and inflation that policymakers face.",2003-03-24
"For the most part, in a regime of flexible exchange rates, the trend of prices over the long run should be under the control of the central bank, and exercising that control to achieve something approximating price stability over time is the way the central bank can best contribute to the long-run prosperity of its economy.",2003-03-24
I have no quarrel with the overall arc of his story.1 The rise of inflation from the mid-1960s through the 1970s was highly damaging to the performance of the U.S. economy and could have been stopped and reversed much earlier than it was by a determined monetary policy better focused on price stability.,2003-03-24
"The restoration of price stability has taken time and entailed considerable cost to output in the 1979-82 period and, perhaps, some constraint on policy flexibility thereafter.",2003-03-24
"A number of factors have contributed to the reestablishment of price stability, but surely an essential ingredient has been the attention that the Federal Reserve has paid to long-run trends in inflation and inflation expectations since 1979.",2003-03-24
We are better off now that price stability has been restored and economic agents expect inflation to stay low and stable.,2003-03-24
"Marvin argues that to extend this successful policy record the United States should adopt an explicit, numerical target range for inflation and the Federal Reserve should strive to keep inflation in or near that range.2 However, in my opinion, adopting such an inflation target would not be an effective means for locking in past policy practices.",2003-03-24
"I do not believe that inflation targeting, in any meaningful sense of that term, describes what the Federal Reserve has been doing over the last twenty years, or even in recent years, when Marvin claims that policy has evolved into ""implicit"" inflation targeting.",2003-03-24
"Instead, the success of U.S. monetary policy has in large part derived from its ability to adapt to changing conditions--a flexibility that likely has benefited from the absence of an inflation target.",2003-03-24
"Nonetheless, the U.S. economy has enjoyed most of the benefits ascribed to inflation targeting in terms of anchoring inflation expectations as well as inflation itself.",2003-03-24
"It is the focus on long-term price stability that has fostered these benefits, and I believe that this focus will not be at risk with a change in personnel at the Federal Reserve.",2003-03-24
"Considering these points, I am skeptical that for the United States the potential benefits of changing to a regime of inflation targeting would outweigh its possible costs.",2003-03-24
The Federal Reserve has not been practicing inflation targeting.,2003-03-24
One difficulty in assessing whether the United States has been practicing inflation targeting is in defining the term.,2003-03-24
"For more than 20 years, the Federal Reserve has conducted policy with one eye on fostering long-run price stability over time.",2003-03-24
"The law specifies price stability as one of the Federal Reserve's long-term objectives; its importance to economic performance has been supported by theory and experience; and hence achieving this objective has been a key influence, together with promoting maximum sustainable output, on monetary policy actions.",2003-03-24
"The Federal Reserve has stated publicly many times that it considers long-run price stability both its unique responsibility and the way it can contribute to maximum growth and employment over time.3 Although some might view this policy approach as inflation targeting, this would be a very weak definition.",2003-03-24
"I believe that inflation targeting, as commonly understood and recommended, involves more substance and constraint than this allegiance to achieving price stability over the long run.",2003-03-24
"As Marvin's discussion suggests, there are two key elements in inflation targeting.",2003-03-24
"First is the announcement of an explicit, numerical inflation target.",2003-03-24
The second element is a priority for price stability in monetary policy.,2003-03-24
"Such a priority usually implies a presumption that the central bank should act to keep inflation at the target (or in the range) within some time horizon--that is, that the central bank would not deliberately allow inflation to deviate from the target and would return it to the target promptly if shocks pushed it away.",2003-03-24
I recognize that flexible inflation-targeting frameworks can be derived from structures that minimize the variability of output around potential as well as inflation around its target.,2003-03-24
But inflation targeting is not usually framed that way in practice.,2003-03-24
"In inflation-targeting countries, either the central bank law or the agreement between the central bank and the government usually is stated so that inflation is expected to be held at the target.",2003-03-24
"To be sure, inflation targeting has not meant that countries have ignored output fluctuations.",2003-03-24
"In many circumstances, especially in response to demand shocks, no conflict exists between stabilizing inflation around its objective and stabilizing output around potential.",2003-03-24
"And some deviations from target, of course, are inevitable and permitted; indeed, inflation targeting has become more flexible over time in many countries.",2003-03-24
"But in practice, the presumption still is that the numerical goal will be hit consistently, with the burden of proof on any deviations--and that presumption must be part of the mindset of the policymaker; in most inflation-targeting countries the periodic reports of the central banks are called inflation reports, not inflation and output variability reports.",2003-03-24
Inflation targeting is usually accompanied by elements of accountability linked directly to the inflation target--and to that target alone--and that shapes much of the transparency associated with this framework.,2003-03-24
The Federal Reserve is not an inflation targeter in the obvious sense that it has not had an announced inflation target.,2003-03-24
"Nonetheless, it is interesting to ask whether the Federal Reserve has been an ""implicit inflation targeter,"" as Marvin and others have asserted.",2003-03-24
"That is, has Federal Reserve policy been consistent with the second aspect of the definition above--a priority for placing inflation at its ""implicit"" target and keeping it there?",2003-03-24
"Over this period, inflation remained above most definitions of price stability, and the Federal Reserve was not actively seeking to reduce it.",2003-03-24
"This can be seen by the FOMC's forecasts for inflation reported in the semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress, shown in figure 1 (3 KB PDF).",2003-03-24
"Inflation forecasts for the subsequent year were mostly at or above those for the current year, even though inflation was running well in excess of any reasonable notion of price stability.",2003-03-24
"An inflation-targeting central bank presumably would have been setting policy so that inflation forecasts were moving toward the ""implicit"" price stability target.",2003-03-24
"The Federal Reserve leaned against potential upticks in inflation, but it had no commitment to achieving price stability in a particular time frame; the priority seemed to be on realizing ""maximum sustainable growth"" so long as inflation was not rising from moderate levels.",2003-03-24
"Since the mid-1990s, inflation has been low and stable as measured by the core PCE chain price index--within the range that Marvin has designated as price stability.",2003-03-24
"However, the level and stability of core PCE inflation since 1997 is as much a consequence of unexpected developments as of deliberate policy choices.",2003-03-24
"Importantly, the speedup in productivity growth, even after it was detected, seemed to have greater disinflationary force than anticipated; the broad-based strength of the dollar and the weakness in global commodity prices that accompanied the East Asian crisis that began in 1997 put substantial downward pressure on prices in the United States; and more recently, the recession and resulting output gap have provided another unexpected source of disinflation.",2003-03-24
"Notably, as can be seen in figure 1, in 1997, 1998, and 1999, the FOMC was projecting an increase in inflation the following year from levels already to the high side of Marvin's implicit target.4 And in 2000 and 2001, the FOMC's projections of total PCE inflation for the year ahead exceeded the 2 percent upper end of Marvin's range (see figure 1).",2003-03-24
"Still, the FOMC took no action to bring inflation down; tightening from mid-1999 through mid-2000 was seen as necessary to forestall a sustained acceleration in prices.",2003-03-24
"It was not until July 2002 that the FOMC projected inflation to remain within the range Marvin takes to be its implicit target.5 In addition, at few key junctures in the past five years, the Federal Reserve exercised a more flexible monetary policy than inflation targeting probably would have suggested or allowed.",2003-03-24
"Although forecasts were marked down at this time, the easing was faster and larger than would have been suggested by Taylor-type rules based on our past pattern of behavior and incorporating an implicit inflation target.",2003-03-24
"In effect, to protect against the potential for a really bad outcome for markets and economic activity, the policymakers raised the most likely outcome for inflation--or at least skewed the risks toward the possibility that inflation would pick up.",2003-03-24
"Similarly, in 2001, easing was unusually aggressive, even before September 11, as the extent of the demand shock gradually revealed itself.",2003-03-24
"To be sure, when one looks back, the outcomes in both instances in terms of stable inflation were not any different than inflation targeting would have sought.",2003-03-24
"At issue, however, is whether the FOMC would have responded so aggressively to these shocks if it had been constrained by an inflation target.",2003-03-24
"My sense is that, given the stress on hitting inflation objectives, the pressures of an inflation target would have constrained flexibility that in the end turned out to be useful.",2003-03-24
"His argument is that, in an RBC model with flexible wages, policymakers face no trade-off between stabilizing inflation and the output gap, which obviously bolsters the case for inflation targeting.",2003-03-24
I think it would be naive to assume that circumstances would not arise in which the central bank faced short-term choices between inflation stability and economic or financial stability.,2003-03-24
The U.S. economy has realized the benefits of inflation targeting for anchoring inflation and inflation expectations without its constraints.,2003-03-24
Inflation targeting would benefit the United States if it would help tie down inflation expectations or reduce errors in private-sector inflation forecasts.,2003-03-24
The former would give the central bank more scope to lean against economic imbalances and result in a more favorable trade-off between changes in inflation and in the output gap than otherwise.,2003-03-24
"Better forecasts would produce more efficient allocation of resources as private agents made decisions about spending and saving, and it would reduce arbitrary redistributions of wealth from inflation surprises.",2003-03-24
"In general, however, the empirical evidence does not support a conclusion that shifting to inflation targeting would produce such benefits for the United States.6 In some countries, the adoption of inflation targeting (and the granting of central bank independence, which often occurs at the same time) has helped to reduce inflation expectations.",2003-03-24
"But the countries that have taken this step are often those with a history of high and variable inflation, and it has tended to bring their inflation experience more closely into line with other countries.",2003-03-24
"Since the late 1970s, inflation and inflation expectations have come down in inflation targeting and noninflation targeting countries alike.",2003-03-24
Studies do not tend to show that inflation-targeting countries have gained an advantage relative to other countries in anchoring inflation expectations and reducing sacrifice ratios or in reducing the variance of inflation forecast errors.,2003-03-24
"Apparently, credibility and predictability flow primarily from achieving low inflation, not from the presence of an announced target.",2003-03-24
"As a consequence, inflation expectations seem to be as well anchored and as accurate in the United States as they are in inflation-targeting countries, despite the absence of a numerical inflation target or specification of ""price stability"" here.",2003-03-24
"To investigate further whether inflation targeting helps tie down longer-term inflation expectations, I took a closer look at the sensitivity of some measures of such expectations to economic developments in the United States and several other countries.",2003-03-24
"To measure how firmly long-term inflation expectations are held, I looked at the extent to which long-term forecasts react to changes in short-term forecasts.",2003-03-24
"Column 2 clearly shows that long-term forecasts have varied no more--and perhaps slightly less--in the United States than in inflation-targeting countries, and column three indicates that they are also no more sensitive to variations in short-term forecasts in the United States.",2003-03-24
"Apparently, long-term inflation expectations are as well anchored against short-term inflation variations in the United States as in inflation-targeting countries; variations in short-term inflation forecasts do not appear to pass through to long-term forecasts in any of these countries, whatever the policy regime.",2003-03-24
Figure 2 (81 KB PDF) shows another proxy for changes in inflation expectations--movements in long-term forward rates derived from the government securities yield curve.,2003-03-24
"These are of particular interest since they are related to the ""inflation scares"" identified by Marvin, which he defined by sizable increases in long-term interest rates.",2003-03-24
"However, long-term rates are influenced to some extent by anticipated near-term movements in short-term rates, which may not be related to longer-term inflation expectations, and so the use of a long-term forward rate in this context is preferred.",2003-03-24
"Even so, these rates, like those used by Marvin, can vary with changes in longer-term expected real rates, resulting for example from changes in the longer-term prospects for fiscal policy or the trend rate of growth in productivity.",2003-03-24
"Thus, these measures are, at best, a rough proxy of inflation expectations.7 Since 1990, long-term forward rates in the United States have risen substantially on two occasions--in 1994 and in 1999.",2003-03-24
"Marvin identifies the former as an inflation scare but, for unexplained reasons, not the latter, though the change in the forward rate is no smaller in the second case.",2003-03-24
"However, inflation targeting was just beginning in Sweden and the United Kingdom and was not well established or, arguably, credible.",2003-03-24
"In 1999, forward rates also rose in the United States in response to strong economic growth and high levels of resource utilization.",2003-03-24
"But they increased as much in Canada and Sweden, both inflation targeters.",2003-03-24
"Judging from this proxy, even without an explicit inflation target, the Federal Reserve could strongly counter a perceived demand shock without significant adverse consequences for expectations.",2003-03-24
An inflation-targeting framework is not necessary to lock in low inflation in the future.,2003-03-24
"So far I have argued that inflation targeting would not simply replicate existing policy practices, it would not buy credibility or clarity about future inflation prospects, and it would likely reduce the flexibility that has so importantly contributed to the success of U.S. monetary policy.",2003-03-24
"One could still argue that inflation targeting might be worthwhile, though, if its added constraints on central bank actions were needed to forestall a tendency to backslide toward higher inflation in the future.",2003-03-24
"First, the importance of long-run price stability and its appropriateness as an essential long-run goal of monetary policy are widely recognized and acknowledged.",2003-03-24
"Certainly, this objective for the central bank and the limits of its ability to affect long-term trends in income and employment are agreed on within the academic and central banking communities.",2003-03-24
"More important, the key role of price stability is also recognized and supported by the public and its elected representatives.",2003-03-24
"Price stability has been a legislated long-term goal of the Federal Reserve since 1977; notably, it was retained in 1978 when the Humphrey-Hawkins Act was passed, despite that legislation's overall emphasis on high employment.",2003-03-24
The contrast between the economic difficulties of the 1970s and the successes of the 1980s and 1990s likely has contributed to public understanding and support for low inflation.,2003-03-24
"Even when politicians call for easier monetary policy, they usually frame their recommendation in the context that such a policy would still be consistent with keeping inflation low.",2003-03-24
"Second, the Federal Reserve Act has established an institutional structure for making monetary policy that militates against forgetting or ignoring the lessons of theory and experience or the requirements of the law.",2003-03-24
"Indeed, a leader whose recommendations seem to be leading to higher inflation would likely lose influence rapidly.",2003-03-24
"Marvin foreshadows and supports his argument that inflation targeting is needed to sustain good inflation performance across leadership shifts by raising the possibility that the ""inflation scare"" of 1987 was linked to the change in Chairmen that year and emphasizing how long the subsequent rise in inflation and inflation expectations took to unwind.",2003-03-24
"Inflation and inflation expectations did rise in 1987, reversing a decline in 1986.",2003-03-24
"Oil and import prices escalated rapidly, likely triggering memories of similar circumstances in the 1970s, and import prices were expected to continue to increase for some time as the dollar corrected its earlier overvaluation.",2003-03-24
"In addition, strong demand was boosting capital and labor utilization rates.8 Consequently, a number of reasons existed for a rise in inflation expectations that were not linked to the leadership change.",2003-03-24
"Moreover, as Marvin notes, inflation expectations had increased a few years earlier and were to do so again in 1989 and 1994, when leadership change was not in the winds.",2003-03-24
The rise in underlying inflation and inflation expectations was far smaller and less persistent in the late 1980s than Marvin implies.,2003-03-24
"He cites a jump of more than 2 percentage points from 1986 to 1990 in total PCE inflation, but this increase was greatly influenced by movements in oil prices, which fell in 1986 and spiked higher in 1990 because of the invasion of Kuwait.",2003-03-24
"The acceleration in core PCE inflation, the measure Marvin recommends be targeted, was one-third as much--from 3-3/4 to 4-1/2 percent--from 1986 to 1990.",2003-03-24
"Of course, erosion of the weight that the Federal Reserve has placed on long-term price stability is not impossible and would have adverse consequences for inflation and economic performance.",2003-03-24
Inflation targeting with an explicit political mandate to give long-term price stability priority would make erosion much less likely.,2003-03-24
"But it is not very likely in any event, and I would be hesitant to incur the constraints of inflation targeting until they seemed more necessary.",2003-03-24
"Even if I favored inflation targeting, I still would have serious reservations about the way Marvin seems to propose it be implemented.",2003-03-24
"Marvin notes several levels on which the Federal Reserve could ""make inflation targeting explicit,"" differing by their specificity and whether they would hold in the short run as well as in the long run.",2003-03-24
They range from declaring that inflation in the long run should never vary much on a sustained basis from recent levels to announcing a specific numerical target range for core PCE inflation of 1 to 2 percent and setting policy so that realized inflation would be expected to remain in that range almost always.,2003-03-24
"To implement explicit targeting, he argues that the Federal Reserve could obtain ""congressional acceptance"" of a priority for low long-term inflation by offering in exchange to participate in policy forums that would allow outside commentators to voice their opinions and interact with Federal Reserve officials.",2003-03-24
"However, this trade is not likely to have great appeal to congressional skeptics, since they already have the authority to get testimony and analysis from outside observers and critics of monetary policy.",2003-03-24
"Indeed, such hearings used to be a regular feature in the weeks leading up to semiannual monetary policy hearings.",2003-03-24
"In my view, because the Federal Reserve, appropriately, has limited ""goal independence,"" it has little scope for announcing a numerical inflation target that would tend to constrain its actions without explicit authorization and direction from new legislation.",2003-03-24
"The Federal Reserve has already exercised considerable discretion in interpreting its ""dual mandate"" of price stability and maximum employment in ways it has made clear in its testimonies and reports.",2003-03-24
"In the absence of legislation, going appreciably further in the direction of prioritizing price stability, as would be implied by a numerical target that was expected to be achieved most of the time, would be potentially damaging to the democratic balance and would risk a backlash.",2003-03-24
"The Congress has had several opportunities over the past 15 years to consider bills proposed by legislators to make price stability the primary goal of the Federal Reserve, and it has not passed them nor even given them serious consideration.",2003-03-24
"But it does reinforce the view that it should be asked, and actions to adopt and give priority to numerical inflation targets should await explicit legislative authorization.",2003-03-24
"Moreover, acting without specific authorization would abrogate one of the important advantages of inflation targeting as practiced in most countries--it requires the elected representatives to discuss and reach a conclusion on just what they can and should expect from the central bank.",2003-03-24
This point does not mean that there are no steps the Federal Reserve might consider taking within its current mandate to clarify its views on price stability.,2003-03-24
One such step might be similar to the first level in Marvin's list--discussing in a general way how recent inflation rates relate to the central bank's view of price stability.,2003-03-24
"A more specific approach would be to announce a numerical range of a particular index that might be expected to prevail over the long run, but with no change in the Federal Reserve's relative priorities on price stability and growth.9 To avoid the constraints of inflation targeting, the Federal Reserve would need to be clear that the range did not constitute a firm or presumptive target for inflation over the short- or intermediate-term and that the range could change in response to shifting assessments of the costs and benefits of particular inflation rates, to improvements in measurement techniques, and to readings from other price indexes that seemed to be conveying different information about underlying price trends.",2003-03-24
"However, I have some concerns about even such a ""soft"" inflation target.",2003-03-24
Placing any number on an inflation objective--however much it would be surrounded with caveats--has the potential to constrain policy in some circumstances in which it would not be desirable to do so.,2003-03-24
"If, partly as a consequence, it demanded that the Federal Reserve also quantify ""maximum employment"" or ""maximum sustainable growth"" and give weight to those specifications, policy could be adversely affected.",2003-03-24
"As we have seen so graphically in the last several years, assessments of the level and growth of potential GDP must be revised frequently, and of course these variables are not under the control of the central bank.",2003-03-24
"As I noted earlier, markets seem no less certain of the path for inflation in the United States than in many of those countries with numerical inflation targets, and so the gains from putting numbers on ""price stability"" are likely to be limited..

Nearly every monetary policy testimony (and many reports) for the past 15 years contains similar sentiments and reasoning.,2003-03-24
"Consequently, I do not agree with Marvin's characterization of the Federal Reserve's communication of the importance or priority it places on its long-run price stability objective as ""don't ask, don't tell""; the Federal Reserve has in fact been telling the Congress and the public that price stability is its most important long-run responsibility and intention.",2003-03-24
"Until 2000, the FOMC was projecting total CPI inflation, not core PCE price movements.",2003-03-24
"Of course, the FOMC might have had higher (implicit) targets than Marvin is suggesting, but a policy regime in which one cannot discern the implicit inflation target over several years is probably not inflation targeting.",2003-03-24
"All empirical work on this subject is handicapped by the relatively recent advent of inflation targeting and, as a consequence, the paucity of episodes in which to differentiate behaviors in targeting and nontargeting economies.",2003-03-24
Then I will assess the crosscurrents shaping prospects going forward and the sustainability of recent economic performance and give my perspective on challenges facing monetary policy.,1998-04-09
Let me emphasize that the views about the economic outlook and about monetary policy I present here are my own and should not be interpreted as the position of the Board of Governors or the FOMC.,1998-04-09
"First, there has been strong momentum in private domestic demand -- the sum of consumption, private fixed investment and residential construction -- only partially offset by a decline in net exports.",1998-04-09
"The result has been consistent above-trend growth and a rise in resource utilization rates, particularly in the labor market.",1998-04-09
"Second, the strength in the aggregate demand for goods and services has been encouraged by favorable financial conditions.",1998-04-09
"Whereas, normally, financial conditions become less favorable during an expansion and ultimately constrain demand, in this expansion financial conditions have become increasingly favorable and therefore have continued to support above-trend growth.",1998-04-09
"Third, a coincidence of favorable shocks has enabled businesses to produce at a lower cost; in the short run, at least, this restrains inflation.",1998-04-09
"The result has been a slower increase in the CPI and other measures of the overall price level, even as the economy has raced ahead to higher utilization rates.",1998-04-09
"The favorable shocks have included a decline in oil prices, a decline in import prices associated with the cumulative appreciation in the dollar, technological innovations that have sped the reduction in computer prices, changes in medical care management that have held down the increase in benefit costs, and improved crops that have damped food prices.",1998-04-09
"I have said many times that if I had a dime for every time I have had to say faster-than-expected growth and lower-than-expected inflation, I would be a rich man today!",1998-04-09
"Growth over 1998 was nearly 4%, the highest annual growth in about a decade.",1998-04-09
The unemployment rate declined by about 3/4 percentage point last year to a quarter-century low.,1998-04-09
And inflation declined to a more than 30-year low.,1998-04-09
Monetary policy has helped deliver a low inflation environment and the strong economy and disciplined fiscal policy have delivered a balanced budget.,1998-04-09
"In the case of monetary policy, the low inflation environment is one we believe encourages efficient resource allocation and perhaps higher levels of saving and investment.",1998-04-09
"In the case of fiscal policy, the government is no longer competing with the private sector for private saving, contributing to lower real interest rates and higher rates of capital formation.",1998-04-09
"Normally, this would result in rising inflation, but the favorable supply shocks have not only prevented a rise in inflation, but have allowed inflation to decline.",1998-04-09
Monetary policy has accommodated the above-trend growth and rising utilization rates precisely because they have been accompanied by declining inflation.,1998-04-09
"The unemployment rate is below the consensus estimates of the threshold consistent with stable inflation, although there is somewhat greater than normal uncertainty about this estimate.",1998-04-09
"This threshold is called NAIRU, the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment.",1998-04-09
"On the other hand, the measures of resource utilization in the product market, notably the capacity utilization rate in the manufacturing sector, do not suggest excess demand.",1998-04-09
"There is, in fact, an unusual discrepancy between the unemployment and capacity utilization rates, compared to previous expansions; that is, the capacity utilization rate is lower than would have been expected, based on past experience, at the prevailing unemployment rate.",1998-04-09
"This undoubtedly accounts for the perception of limited pricing leverage and has contributed to the restrained inflation, despite the low unemployment rate.",1998-04-09
"Nevertheless, the very tight labor markets can be expected to put upward pressure on wage change and hence inflation, once the special forces restraining inflation dissipate or reverse.",1998-04-09
"Second, there is some question about how to assess the degree of restraint or stimulus associated with current monetary policy.",1998-04-09
"Although the nominal federal funds rate has remained nearly constant, the decline in inflation has raised the real federal funds rate.",1998-04-09
Many have observed the rise in the real federal funds rate to a level well above its historical average and concluded that monetary policy is currently restrictive.,1998-04-09
The implication is that monetary policy is already well positioned to slow the expansion.,1998-04-09
"On the other hand, many other measures of financial conditions appear to be indicating, to the contrary, that financial conditions are very favorable, highly supportive of contained momentum in aggregate demand and perhaps becoming even more so.",1998-04-09
This interpretation appears to be confirmed by the continued strength in aggregate demand in general and in interest-sensitive sectors in particular.,1998-04-09
"Real long-term interest rates, based on survey measures of inflation, have been stable to declining, equity prices have been soaring, credit availability has been more than ample, underwriting standards may have eased some, loan pricing is aggressive, spreads between safe and risky assets have narrowed, and the money supply is growing rapidly.",1998-04-09
"I conclude that, notwithstanding the recent rise in the real federal funds rate, neither financial conditions in general nor monetary policy in particular are currently restraining aggregate demand.",1998-04-09
"Third, there has been a significant rebound in productivity growth over 1996 and 1997, compared to the previous two years.",1998-04-09
The question that the data do not immediately reveal is whether this rebound was a normal cyclical rebound or marks a significant increase in trend productivity growth.,1998-04-09
Each story carries with it an implication about the sustainability of recent performance and a challenge for monetary policy.,1998-04-09
This story emphasizes the role of good fortune in the current exceptional performance and highlights the potential that we may not be able to maintain the recent rate of growth and the current high labor utilization rates for much longer without ultimately suffering an increase in inflation.,1998-04-09
"The key to this story is the series of favorable supply shocks that have, in my judgment, masked, for a time, the normal consequences of very tight labor markets and permitted the economy to operate beyond the point of long-run sustainable capacity without the usual inflationary consequences.",1998-04-09
"The challenge facing monetary policy, in this interpretation, is to facilitate a transition to a more sustainable state before the favorable supply shocks dissipate or reverse.",1998-04-09
This story emphasizes the possibility that structural changes have permanently altered what the economy is capable of delivering in terms of both average growth and the unemployment rate consistent with stable inflation.,1998-04-09
"In this interpretation, monetary policy must be careful not to interfere with the economy taking advantage of its improved potential.",1998-04-09
"I have also raised my estimate of trend productivity -- from 1.1%, the average rate for the 20 years prior to the current expansion to 1.3% or 1.4%.",1998-04-09
A tenth of this increase in trend productivity growth reflects the technical revisions to the CPI which have lowered the chain measure of the GDP deflator by a tenth.,1998-04-09
"This is not an increase in trend productivity in this expansion, relative to previous expansions, but rather an upward revision to productivity growth over the entire postwar period, the mirror image of a decline in the upward bias to measured inflation.",1998-04-09
"It should be noted, nevertheless, that the technical revisions to measured inflation do account for part of the appearance of improved economic performance.",1998-04-09
"In addition, the data suggest to me, as to many private sector forecasters, that there might be a tenth or two increase in trend productivity, an improvement that is generally associated with capital deepening, an increase in the amount of equipment each worker has at its disposal, as a result of the strength of investment in this expansion.",1998-04-09
"As such, this improvement in productivity growth may itself be transitory, part of a one-time increase in the level of productivity associated with a transition to a higher capital-to-labor ratio.",1998-04-09
"Nevertheless, even a couple of tenths improvement in productivity growth, if sustained for some period, would give an important boost to higher living standards over time.",1998-04-09
But this upward adjustment in my estimate of the productivity trend plays only a negligible role in explaining how we have managed such exceptional economic performance over the last couple of years.,1998-04-09
The relative weights here are very important because they affect the challenge for monetary policy.,1998-04-09
"Challenges for Monetary Policy The challenge for monetary policy, as always, is to sustain the best possible economic performance.",1998-04-09
We aim for maximum sustainable growth and maximum sustainable levels of output and employment.,1998-04-09
Trying to do more threatens to give back some of the reduction in inflation that has moved the U.S. to a position very close to the Federal Reserve's objective of price stability.,1998-04-09
The bottom line is that it is essential that growth slow from the near 4% over 1997 to and perhaps below trend for a while to allow the economy to move toward a more sustainable state.,1998-04-09
"First, there is a tug of war between the continued exceptional momentum in private domestic demand and the external drag from the Asian crisis.",1998-04-09
"Still, the sharper-than-expected decline in oil prices, the decline in long-term bond yields and the further rise in equity prices in recent months are providing some offset to the external drag coming from Asia and the appreciation of the dollar.",1998-04-09
"The question is when and how much of a slowing results, and whether the slowdown takes growth to or below trend, or leaves growth still above trend.",1998-04-09
"Second, there is a tug of war between the very tight labor market and the set of forces that have been restraining inflation.",1998-04-09
"The forces restraining inflation have been winning this battle to date, and they have been reinforced this year by the sharper-than-expected decline in oil prices, by the even more extraordinary decline in computer prices in recent months, and by the decline in commodity prices and further downward pressure on import prices associated with the crisis in Asia.",1998-04-09
"As the economy entered 1998, continued momentum in private domestic demand was clearly evident, while the drag from Asia was less obvious.",1998-04-09
"The March employment report was the strongest evidence to date that a slowing is under way, although it should be appreciated that there is often more noise than signal in one month's data.",1998-04-09
"In terms of inflation, there is no evidence to date that wage pressures are building, relative to last year, and certainly no evidence of a pickup in inflation, though the recent data for core CPI has hinted that the earlier downward trend may now be behind us.",1998-04-09
"At any rate, it appears likely, given the renewal of favorable supply shocks, that inflation will remain well contained this year.",1998-04-09
But monetary policy has little ability to affect inflation this year.,1998-04-09
"We should, therefore, be focusing on inflation prospects for next year.",1998-04-09
"As I noted earlier, some upward pressure on inflation is likely going forward as forces retraining inflation dissipate or reverse, though a similar statement would have been in order at this time last year.",1998-04-09
The expected persistence of the special forces restraining inflation is therefore an important consideration in forecasting inflation and in assessing the appropriate course of monetary policy.,1998-04-09
"It is important that, as the forces retraining inflation dissipate or reverse, that this upward pressure on inflation is not reinforced by inflationary pressures generated from very high utilization rates.",1998-04-09

"August 27, 2020 New Economic Challenges and the Fed's Monetary Policy Review Chair Jerome H. Powell At ""Navigating the Decade Ahead: Implications for Monetary Policy,"" an economic policy symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, Wyoming (via webcast) Share Watch Live Thank you, Esther, for that introduction, and good morning.",2020-08-27
"For the past year and a half, my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) have been conducting the first-ever public review of our monetary policy framework.1 Earlier today we released a revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, a document that lays out our goals, articulates our framework for monetary policy, and serves as the foundation for our policy actions.2 Today I will discuss our review, the changes in the economy that motivated us to undertake it, and our revised statement, which encapsulates the main conclusions of the review.",2020-08-27
"Evolution of the Fed's Monetary Policy Framework We began this public review in early 2019 to assess the monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications that would best foster achievement of our congressionally assigned goals of maximum employment and price stability over the years ahead in service to the American people.",2020-08-27
"Forty years ago, the biggest problem our economy faced was high and rising inflation.3 The Great Inflation demanded a clear focus on restoring the credibility of the FOMC's commitment to price stability.",2020-08-27
"Chair Paul Volcker brought that focus to bear, and the ""Volcker disinflation,"" with the continuing stewardship of Alan Greenspan, led to the stabilization of inflation and inflation expectations in the 1990s at around 2 percent.",2020-08-27
This new era brought new challenges to the conduct of monetary policy.,2020-08-27
"Before the Great Moderation, expansions typically ended in overheating and rising inflation.",2020-08-27
"Since then, prior to the current pandemic-induced downturn, a series of historically long expansions had been more likely to end with episodes of financial instability, prompting essential efforts to substantially increase the strength and resilience of the financial system.4 By the early 2000s, many central banks around the world had adopted a monetary policy framework known as inflation targeting.5 Although the precise features of inflation targeting differed from country to country, the core framework always articulated an inflation goal as a primary objective of monetary policy.",2020-08-27
Inflation targeting was also associated with increased communication and transparency designed to clarify the central bank's policy intentions.,2020-08-27
"Inflation-targeting central banks generally do not focus solely on inflation: Those with ""flexible"" inflation targets take into account economic stabilization in addition to their inflation objective.",2020-08-27
"Under Ben Bernanke's leadership, the Federal Reserve adopted many of the features associated with flexible inflation targeting.6 We made great advances in transparency and communications, with the initiation of quarterly press conferences and the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which comprises the individual economic forecasts of FOMC participants.",2020-08-27
"During that time, thenâ€“Board Vice Chair Janet Yellen led an effort on behalf of the FOMC to codify the Committee's approach to monetary policy.",2020-08-27
"In January 2012, the Committee issued its first Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which we often refer to as the consensus statement.",2020-08-27
"A central part of this statement was the articulation of a longer-run inflation goal of 2 percent.7 Because the structure of the labor market is strongly influenced by nonmonetary factors that can change over time, the Committee did not set a numerical objective for maximum employment.",2020-08-27
"The 2012 statement was a significant milestone, reflecting lessons learned from fighting high inflation as well as from experience around the world with flexible inflation targeting.",2020-08-27
"Since then, our understanding of the economy has evolved in ways that are central to monetary policy.",2020-08-27
"Of course, the conduct of monetary policy has also evolved.",2020-08-27
A key purpose of our review has been to take stock of the lessons learned over this period and identify any further changes in our monetary policy framework that could enhance our ability to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability objectives in the years ahead.9 Our evolving understanding of four key economic developments motivated our review.,2020-08-27
"First, assessments of the potential, or longer-run, growth rate of the economy have declined.",2020-08-27
"For example, since January 2012, the median estimate of potential growth from FOMC participants has fallen from 2.5 percent to 1.8 percent (see figure 1).",2020-08-27
"Some slowing in growth relative to earlier decades was to be expected, reflecting slowing population growth and the aging of the population.",2020-08-27
"More troubling has been the decline in productivity growth, which is the primary driver of improving living standards over time.10 Second, the general level of interest rates has fallen both here in the United States and around the world.",2020-08-27
"Estimates of the neutral federal funds rate, which is the rate consistent with the economy operating at full strength and with stable inflation, have fallen substantially, in large part reflecting a fall in the equilibrium real interest rate, or ""r-star.""",2020-08-27
"This rate is not affected by monetary policy but instead is driven by fundamental factors in the economy, including demographics and productivity growthâ€”the same factors that drive potential economic growth.11 The median estimate from FOMC participants of the neutral federal funds rate has fallen by nearly half since early 2012, from 4.25 percent to 2.5 percent (see figure 2).",2020-08-27
This decline in assessments of the neutral federal funds rate has profound implications for monetary policy.,2020-08-27
"With interest rates generally running closer to their effective lower bound even in good times, the Fed has less scope to support the economy during an economic downturn by simply cutting the federal funds rate.12 The result can be worse economic outcomes in terms of both employment and price stability, with the costs of such outcomes likely falling hardest on those least able to bear them.",2020-08-27
"The unemployment rate hovered near 50-year lows for roughly 2 years, well below most estimates of its sustainable level.",2020-08-27
And the unemployment rate captures only part of the story.,2020-08-27
"The Black and Hispanic unemployment rates reached record lows, and the differentials between these rates and the white unemployment rate narrowed to their lowest levels on record.14 As we heard repeatedly in our Fed Listens events, the robust job market was delivering life-changing gains for many individuals, families, and communities, particularly at the lower end of the income spectrum.15 In addition, many who had been left behind for too long were finding jobs, benefiting their families and communities, and increasing the productive capacity of our economy.",2020-08-27
"It is hard to overstate the benefits of sustaining a strong labor market, a key national goal that will require a range of policies in addition to supportive monetary policy.",2020-08-27
"Fourth, the historically strong labor market did not trigger a significant rise in inflation.",2020-08-27
"Over the years, forecasts from FOMC participants and private-sector analysts routinely showed a return to 2 percent inflation, but these forecasts were never realized on a sustained basis (see figure 3).",2020-08-27
"Inflation forecasts are typically predicated on estimates of the natural rate of unemployment, or ""u-star,"" and of how much upward pressure on inflation arises when the unemployment rate falls relative to u-star.16 As the unemployment rate moved lower and inflation remained muted, estimates of u-star were revised down.",2020-08-27
"The muted responsiveness of inflation to labor market tightness, which we refer to as the flattening of the Phillips curve, also contributed to low inflation outcomes.17 In addition, longer-term inflation expectations, which we have long seen as an important driver of actual inflation, and global disinflationary pressures may have been holding down inflation more than was generally anticipated.",2020-08-27
Other advanced economies have also struggled to achieve their inflation goals in recent decades.,2020-08-27
The persistent undershoot of inflation from our 2 percent longer-run objective is a cause for concern.,2020-08-27
Many find it counterintuitive that the Fed would want to push up inflation.,2020-08-27
"After all, low and stable inflation is essential for a well-functioning economy.",2020-08-27
"And we are certainly mindful that higher prices for essential items, such as food, gasoline, and shelter, add to the burdens faced by many families, especially those struggling with lost jobs and incomes.",2020-08-27
"However, inflation that is persistently too low can pose serious risks to the economy.",2020-08-27
"Inflation that runs below its desired level can lead to an unwelcome fall in longer-term inflation expectations, which, in turn, can pull actual inflation even lower, resulting in an adverse cycle of ever-lower inflation and inflation expectations.",2020-08-27
This dynamic is a problem because expected inflation feeds directly into the general level of interest rates.,2020-08-27
"Well-anchored inflation expectations are critical for giving the Fed the latitude to support employment when necessary without destabilizing inflation.18 But if inflation expectations fall below our 2 percent objective, interest rates would decline in tandem.",2020-08-27
"In turn, we would have less scope to cut interest rates to boost employment during an economic downturn, further diminishing our capacity to stabilize the economy through cutting interest rates.",2020-08-27
One of the clear messages we heard was that the strong labor market that prevailed before the pandemic was generating employment opportunities for many Americans who in the past had not found jobs readily available.,2020-08-27
"A clear takeaway from these events was the importance of achieving and sustaining a strong job market, particularly for people from low- and moderate-income communities.",2020-08-27
"When we resumed our discussions last month, we turned our attention to distilling the most important lessons of the review in a revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.",2020-08-27
"New Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy The federated structure of the Federal Reserve, reflected in the FOMC, ensures that we always have a diverse range of perspectives on monetary policy, and that is certainly the case today.",2020-08-27
"Our new consensus statement, like its predecessor, explains how we interpret the mandate Congress has given us and describes the broad framework that we believe will best promote our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.",2020-08-27
"We continue to believe that specifying a numerical goal for employment is unwise, because the maximum level of employment is not directly measurable and changes over time for reasons unrelated to monetary policy.",2020-08-27
The significant shifts in estimates of the natural rate of unemployment over the past decade reinforce this point.,2020-08-27
"In addition, we have not changed our view that a longer-run inflation rate of 2 percent is most consistent with our mandate to promote both maximum employment and price stability.",2020-08-27
"Finally, we continue to believe that monetary policy must be forward looking, taking into account the expectations of households and businesses and the lags in monetary policy's effect on the economy.",2020-08-27
Our new statement explicitly acknowledges the challenges posed by the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound.,2020-08-27
"By reducing our scope to support the economy by cutting interest rates, the lower bound increases downward risks to employment and inflation.22 To counter these risks, we are prepared to use our full range of tools to support the economy.",2020-08-27
"With regard to the employment side of our mandate, our revised statement emphasizes that maximum employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal.",2020-08-27
"This change reflects our appreciation for the benefits of a strong labor market, particularly for many in low- and moderate-income communities.23 In addition, our revised statement says that our policy decision will be informed by our ""assessments of the shortfalls of employment from its maximum level"" rather than by ""deviations from its maximum level"" as in our previous statement.24 This change may appear subtle, but it reflects our view that a robust job market can be sustained without causing an outbreak of inflation.",2020-08-27
"In earlier decades when the Phillips curve was steeper, inflation tended to rise noticeably in response to a strengthening labor market.",2020-08-27
It was sometimes appropriate for the Fed to tighten monetary policy as employment rose toward its estimated maximum level in order to stave off an unwelcome rise in inflation.,2020-08-27
"The change to ""shortfalls"" clarifies that, going forward, employment can run at or above real-time estimates of its maximum level without causing concern, unless accompanied by signs of unwanted increases in inflation or the emergence of other risks that could impede the attainment of our goals.25 Of course, when employment is below its maximum level, as is clearly the case now, we will actively seek to minimize that shortfall by using our tools to support economic growth and job creation.",2020-08-27
We have also made important changes with regard to the price-stability side of our mandate.,2020-08-27
Our longer-run goal continues to be an inflation rate of 2 percent.,2020-08-27
Our statement emphasizes that our actions to achieve both sides of our dual mandate will be most effective if longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.,2020-08-27
"However, if inflation runs below 2 percent following economic downturns but never moves above 2 percent even when the economy is strong, then, over time, inflation will average less than 2 percent.",2020-08-27
"Households and businesses will come to expect this result, meaning that inflation expectations would tend to move below our inflation goal and pull realized inflation down.",2020-08-27
"To prevent this outcome and the adverse dynamics that could ensue, our new statement indicates that we will seek to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time.",2020-08-27
"Therefore, following periods when inflation has been running below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.",2020-08-27
"In seeking to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, we are not tying ourselves to a particular mathematical formula that defines the average.",2020-08-27
"Thus, our approach could be viewed as a flexible form of average inflation targeting.26 Our decisions about appropriate monetary policy will continue to reflect a broad array of considerations and will not be dictated by any formula.",2020-08-27
"Of course, if excessive inflationary pressures were to build or inflation expectations were to ratchet above levels consistent with our goal, we would not hesitate to act.",2020-08-27
The revisions to our statement add up to a robust updating of our monetary policy framework.,2020-08-27
"Overall, our new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy conveys our continued strong commitment to achieving our goals, given the difficult challenges presented by the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound.",2020-08-27
"In conducting monetary policy, we will remain highly focused on fostering as strong a labor market as possible for the benefit of all Americans.",2020-08-27
And we will steadfastly seek to achieve a 2 percent inflation rate over time.,2020-08-27
The emergence of sustained inflationary pressures in the 1960s and 1970s and central banks' long and difficult struggle to combat these pressures helped forge this consensus.,2003-02-12
Inflation began to drift higher during the Vietnam War and flared into double digits following the sharp increases in oil prices in the middle and late 1970s.,2003-02-12
Although snapping the inflationary spiral was painful for our nation--the recession of the early 1980s was the deepest since the Great Depression--the subsequent prosperity in terms of income growth and economic stability has been unprecedented.,2003-02-12
The experience deepened the conviction of many economists and central bankers that economic policies that push an economy to operate beyond its long-run potential to produce inevitably lead to rising rates of inflation.,2003-02-12
"Moreover, the strong economic performance of the U.S. economy following the taming of inflation has supported the view that price stability fosters economic efficiency and higher productivity.",2003-02-12
"Indeed, price stability is now a formal objective included in the charters of nearly all central banks.",2003-02-12
"A firm long-run focus on price stability does not mean that the central bank cannot have other economic goals, although central bankers disagree on this somewhat, at least in emphasis and priority.",2003-02-12
"Many nations or economic regions, including the United Kingdom and the euro area, have adopted price stability as their primary objective.",2003-02-12
"But in our case, we often summarize the multiple statutory goals of the Federal Reserve in terms of the ""dual objectives"" of price stability and sustainable economic growth.",2003-02-12
Our experience in the United States has been that multiple objectives for policy do not undermine policy performance when the public is convinced that the central bank is committed to price stability over the long run.,2003-02-12
"Indeed, the commitment to long-run price stability can afford the central bank some flexibility in employing its tools to address shorter-run economic issues.",2003-02-12
"Since I joined the Federal Reserve in 1997, the U.S. economy has weathered a remarkable series of economic shocks--both positive and negative--and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has adjusted the stance of monetary policy over a wide range in response to those shocks.",2003-02-12
"And yet, through it all, long-term inflation expectations have remained very stable and at very low levels.",2003-02-12
"Partly as a result, long-term nominal interest rates, which contain a premium reflecting long-term inflation expectations, are as low as they have been in fifty years.",2003-02-12
"Although central bankers have focused much of their attention on combating and containing inflation pressures over recent decades, the very low levels of inflation and recent sluggish economic growth in the United States have prompted worries in some quarters about the potential for deflation in this country.",2003-02-12
"The case of Japan in recent years serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of deflation, especially when a central bank has pushed its traditional policy tool--the short-term interest rate--to zero.",2003-02-12
"And perhaps even more important, the U.S. economy has proven enormously resilient and productive in recent years, and the gains in productivity have continued even as the economy has experienced subpar growth.",2003-02-12
"Finally, current rates of inflation depend to a large extent on the inflation rates that people expect in the future, so the stability of inflation expectations over recent years should be a factor working against any buildup of deflationary pressures.",2003-02-12
Inflation expectations are so stable in part because central bankers have been increasingly clear about both their long-run inflation objectives and their shorter-run tactics in pursuing those objectives.,2003-02-12
"As a case in point, the increase in the transparency of U.S. monetary policy over the past two decades has been quite significant.",2003-02-12
Twenty years ago the monetary policy decisions of the FOMC were inferred by legions of Fed-watchers who gleaned information from slight variations in how we conducted our open market operations.,2003-02-12
"Systematic policy setting is easier to explain and anticipate and, as a consequence, helps to limit economic uncertainty associated with the conduct of monetary policy.",2003-02-12
"A resurgence in interest and research about systematic approaches to monetary policy was sparked by the observation of John Taylor, currently Undersecretary of the Department of the Treasury, that the FOMC's conduct of monetary policy since the late 1980s has been well explained by a simple formula, often called the Taylor rule, that relates the level of the federal funds rate to the observed levels of the inflation and the unemployment rates.",2003-02-12
The part of policy not explained by the rule then reflects the large volume of information about the economy and its prospects that is not captured by current inflation and unemployment rates but that the FOMC does take into account.,2003-02-12
"The success of the Taylor rule in capturing the broad contour of policy actions in recent years has prompted an enormous amount of economic research in search of refinements to or extensions of the original Taylor rule that could provide an even more precise guide for central bankers--in effect, a rule that could serve as an ""automatic pilot"" for monetary policy.",2003-02-12
"In my view, rules, including the Taylor rule and its many variations, are useful benchmarks, but following an automatic policy prescribed by any pre-established rule would unnecessarily and undesirably limit the flexibility and judgment necessary in setting monetary policy.",2003-02-12
I have similar misgivings about other formulaic monetary policy proposals--sometimes referred to as strict inflation targeting--that would require the Federal Reserve to announce a numerical inflation target or range and conduct monetary policy at all times so as to keep actual inflation close to that objective.,2003-02-12
"In effect, advocates of strict inflation targeting would have the central bank follow an amended Taylor-type rule in which the setting of interest rates is determined solely by the deviation of actual or projected inflation from a target.",2003-02-12
"I would argue that the conduct of monetary policy and the associated economic performance in the United States in recent years clearly demonstrate that a central bank can and, if directed by the elected officials who create the central bank, should do more than this.",2003-02-12
"As I've noted, the Federal Reserve has successfully established a credible commitment to long-term price stability while operating within a framework that allows flexibility in adjusting the stance of policy in the near-term in response to fluctuations in both economic activity and inflation.",2003-02-12
"Although our understanding of the economy and monetary policy has improved considerably over the past several decades, it is not nearly advanced enough to allow us to pre-specify an optimal policy rule or to adopt a rigid targeting framework that will serve well in all circumstances.",2003-02-12
"Furthermore, while requiring the Federal Reserve to target an inflation rate might seem to make our intentions more transparent and credible, the existing twin goals of stable prices and maximum sustainable growth, as I noted, are mutually compatible.",2003-02-12
"Given that inflation is low and stable and that the Federal Reserve has achieved credibility in its commitment to maintain price stability while still acting to buffer employment and output from excessive variability, I see no advantage to taking away our mandate to be concerned about developments other than inflation rates or inflation prospects.",2003-02-12
Strict inflation targeting and other rule-based approaches are ideas put forward by some central bank observers.,2003-02-12
"However, a more nuanced proposal has emerged more recently, known as flexible inflation targeting.",2003-02-12
"Under this regime, a central bank, in this case the Federal Reserve, announces an inflation target and commits to keeping inflation near the target at some horizon while recognizing that inflation may deviate from the target on occasion as other important objectives take on temporary urgency.",2003-02-12
"Such an approach might leave the central bank open to the criticism that it has adopted only the language of a more formal inflation target without any of the constraints that normally go with such a regime and, in doing so, is being less transparent, not more.",2003-02-12
Having an announced inflation target that is pursued flexibly might also lead to greater uncertainty about policy.,2003-02-12
"Deviations of inflation from the target would be highly visible, and the public might not know whether the central bank would choose to return inflation immediately to the target or allow the deviation from target to persist for some time.",2003-02-12
Allowing inflation to persist by exercising the various escape clauses embedded in many flexible inflation-targeting regimes might also erode central bank credibility.,2003-02-12
"Most important, I believe that the quantified inflation target would come to take greater prominence over other important and consistent objectives implied by the flexible approach, with an inevitable reduction in flexibility and a downplaying of those other objectives.",2003-02-12
"The committee's members, being well-versed in the monetary history of the 1970s and 1980s, recognize the great effort that previous incarnations of the FOMC expended to gain credibility as a central bank committed to price stability, and I expect that future generations of the committee will share that understanding.",2003-02-12
"To this point, I've noted my concerns about strict rule-based or other formulaic approaches to monetary policy for the United States mostly at an abstract level.",2003-02-12
One of the most notable economic developments in recent years has been the evident step-up in the rate of productivity growth.,2003-02-12
That development resulted in a considerable divergence of the actual level of inflation from the levels that would have been anticipated based on historical relationships.,2003-02-12
"Instead, the Federal Reserve recognized the changes under way and took account of the step-up in productivity growth in reaching a judgment about the rate of ""sustainable economic growth.""",2003-02-12
This judgment permitted more-rapid income growth and considerable progress in reducing unemployment while containing the risk of inflation.,2003-02-12
Episodes of financial turmoil in recent years have also provided examples of the need for flexibility and discretion in the conduct of monetary policy--and the potential pitfalls of rigid rule-based policy.,2003-02-12
Even though the unemployment rate was reaching new lows--which according to standard relationships would lead to higher inflation and which standard monetary policy rules would recommend addressing by tightening policy--the FOMC judged that the severity of the financial crises was likely to imperil future growth and lowered interest rates substantially.,2003-02-12
"By early 1999, financial markets had improved, and the FOMC began to raise rates in view of strong growth in aggregate demand and resulting pressures on our nation's labor and capital resources, which, if left unchecked, could have resulted in greater inflation.",2003-02-12
"Moreover, to minimize the risk that monetary policy would inadvertently trigger problems, the monetary tightening process was put on hold at the December 21, 1999, meeting to minimize the uncertainty when everyone was concerned about the century date change.",2003-02-12
"Again, our approach to monetary policy in the run-up to Y2K would have been very difficult to capture in a simple rule, or in a complicated one for that matter.",2003-02-12
"In recognition of that experience, many have characterized the extraordinary rise in stock prices in the late 1990s as a bubble--a significant and protracted departure in asset prices from fundamentals--and the subsequent decline as a popping of that bubble.",2003-02-12
"Our recent experience has given renewed spark to a vigorous debate about the appropriate response of monetary policy to financial bubbles, with some economists criticizing the Federal Reserve for not having done more to stem the expansion of the bubble.",2003-02-12
One branch of economists holds the view that monetary policy should not be influenced by any perceived financial market bubbles.,2003-02-12
An extreme version of this view is that bubbles probably do not exist--that rational market processes always price assets at their fundamental value.,2003-02-12
"A more moderate version is that even if bubbles do exist, they cannot reliably be identified, and even if bubbles can be identified, we do not know how they respond to monetary policy.",2003-02-12
"According to this view, by raising interest rates when a bubble begins, the central bank can avoid the volatility that occurs when a bubble fully inflates and then pops.",2003-02-12
"On the one hand, I am skeptical that central bankers or anyone else can accurately identify bubbles as they are inflating, and I know of no central banker who understands with great certainty how bubbles respond to monetary policy.",2003-02-12
"On the other hand, the FOMC does attempt to take into account the effect of asset values on the economy when setting interest rates and does consider the likely reaction of asset prices to our policy decisions.",2003-02-12
"Another type of financial instability that can influence monetary policy in a way that is very difficult to embed in a rule occurs when important intermediaries--banks, securities dealers, hedge funds--fail or when markets seize up in a financial crisis.",2003-02-12
"This can happen when a financial bubble pops but also after a large swing in interest rates, commodity prices, or other prices or even, as I will discuss in a moment, a terrorist attack that causes financial market participants to pull back from risk-taking.",2003-02-12
"Generally, in severe financial crises, central banks inject liquidity into the financial system to meet temporarily higher demands and may even inject enough liquidity to lower short-term interest rates if a crisis seems likely to damp economic activity.",2003-02-12
The central bank responds to the financial difficulties precisely because they threaten to imperil future economic growth.,2003-02-12
I would certainly agree that forward-looking rules--rules that take into account likely future developments--are likely to be better bases for monetary policy than backward-looking rules.,2003-02-12
"But I remain convinced that the appropriate response to complex, rapidly changing financial developments cannot be simply quantified even when mapped through forecasts of economic activity, and hence it requires flexibility and judgment on the part of the policymakers.",2003-02-12
Events in 2001 could not have more clearly demonstrated the need for flexibility in monetary policymaking and the inevitable shortcomings of rigid monetary policy rules.,2003-02-12
"Shortly thereafter, in view of signs that the attacks had caused a severe negative shock to confidence, the Federal Reserve began to ease monetary policy to cushion the likely resulting pullback in spending by households and businesses, again departing from the prescriptions of monetary policy rules based solely upon available backward-looking data for the recent values of variables such as inflation and unemployment.",2003-02-12
"In sum, over the past twenty-five years some important consensuses have been achieved on the best way to conduct monetary policy.",2003-02-12
"Central banks have adopted price stability as a key long-term objective, and they have become more transparent and systematic in their operations.",2003-02-12
"However, opinion on how to conduct policy divides in at least two critical areas--how rigidly monetary policy should be determined by rules and the way monetary policy should respond to financial instability.",2003-02-12
"As long as policymakers are clear about their aversion to price instability and act in accordance with that aversion, they can respond flexibly to economic and financial developments without losing credibility as fighters for price stability.",2003-02-12
"This statement, of course, assumes that the central bank has and maintains its credibility in the pursuit of price stability.",2003-02-12
"We would not be particularly puzzled if the increases in output per hour were occurring during a period of very rapid economic growth, such as has often attended recoveries from steep recessions.",2002-10-23
But during the past year we averaged only modest economic growth.,2002-10-23
"This conclusion is buttressed by recent sizable increases estimated for labor productivity for the manufacturing sector, derived from a data system that, for the most part, is independent of the national accounts.",2002-10-23
"To be sure, because the productivity feast of recent quarters has been so difficult to explain, many analysts expect a productivity famine in the period ahead.",2002-10-23
"Regardless of how events unfold, we will need to confront difficult questions posed by the recent performance of productivity, if we are to properly evaluate economic developments going forward.",2002-10-23
"Indeed, if the recent surge in measured productivity is not a statistical mirage, or if it is not expunged by data revisions, then we need to ask about its possible causes.",2002-10-23
"Clearly, over the past year corporate managers, confronted with tepid demand and a virtual disappearance of pricing power, have struggled to maintain profit margins.",2002-10-23
"With price increases largely off the table and demand soft, lowered costs have become the central focus of achieving increased profitability.",2002-10-23
"Moreover, for capital with active secondary markets, such as computers and networking equipment, productivity may also have been boosted by a reallocation to firms that could use the equipment more efficiently.",2002-10-23
"Unlike cutting fat, which permanently elevates the levels of productivity, these gains in output per hour are often temporary, as more demanding workloads eventually begin to tax workers and impede efficiency.",2002-10-23
"Perhaps the return to a low-inflation environment in recent years in itself explains the intensification of competitive pressures, which has been a spur to the growth of productivity.",2002-10-23
"Indeed, the data do suggest a relationship between inflation and productivity growth over the long run.",2002-10-23
"But that statistical relationship is modest at best and inferring causality is complicated by a circularity that arises because increased growth in output per hour depresses unit labor costs and, hence, prices.",2002-10-23
"Taken at face value, historical relationships suggest low inflation would explain very little of the most recent surge in output per hour.",2002-10-23
"To be sure, while lack of pricing power and associated competitive pressures may have initiated much of the cost cutting and organizational changes that have occurred, it will ultimately be the quantity of fat in the system and the opportunities for productive reorganization that will determine the potential gains in productivity.",2002-10-23
"Only in retrospect, if then, will we be able to ascertain how much of the past year's elevated growth in output per hour was transitory--that is, growth that resulted from cutting of fat, reorganizing operations, and more fully exploiting technologies already embedded in the existing capital stock.",2002-10-23
"Such improvements, even though they are long-lasting, are, of course, a level adjustment with no necessary implications for productivity growth going forward.",2002-10-23
The recent upsurge in the growth of output per hour has understandably renewed interest in the relationship between investment and so-called adjustment costs.,2002-10-23
This lower level of disruption provides a boost to growth in output per hour for a time.,2002-10-23
The quantitative evidence on the magnitude of this effect spans the range from significant to small.2 The ability of businesses to boost productivity with what seems to be minimal new capital investment over the past two years suggests that output per hour growth in the later years of the 1990s likely trailed the growth in underlying productivity in those years.,2002-10-23
"If this inference is accurate, part of that earlier growth in underlying productivity is being reflected in today's gains in output per hour.",2002-10-23
"The difficulty in explaining the recent past is most evident when we decompose gains in output per hour into the contribution from changes in worker quality, the amount of capital used by workers--that is, capital deepening--and the contribution from all other factors, a notion that economists label ""multifactor productivity.""",2002-10-23
"By definition, multifactor productivity includes technical change, organizational improvements, cyclical factors, and myriad other influences on output per hour, apart from capital investment.",2002-10-23
"With capital spending sluggish over the past year, and no evident acceleration of worker quality, it is likely that growth of multifactor productivity accounts for an appreciable portion of the rise in output per hour.",2002-10-23
"Based on historical experience, it seems improbable that all of the large rise in multifactor productivity could be attributed to cyclical or transitory factors.",2002-10-23
"Conversely, it seems very unlikely that all of the increase in the growth of productivity could be attributed to structural influences.",2002-10-23
"At minimum, however, it seems reasonable to conclude that the step-up in the pace of structural productivity growth that occurred in the latter part of the 1990s has not, as yet, faltered.",2002-10-23
"Indeed, high growth of productivity over the past year merely extends recent experience.",2002-10-23
"Although we cannot know with certainty until the books are closed, the growth of productivity since 1995 appears to be among the largest in decades.",2002-10-23
"The result was an outsized increase in the level of productivity spread over a decade or two, with unusually rapid growth rates observed during the transition to the higher level.",2002-10-23
"For example, as the benefits that attended the development of the electric dynamo and the internal combustion engine more than a century ago became manifest in both the capital stock and the organization of production, the growth of labor productivity surged.",2002-10-23
"Subsequently, productivity growth returned to a 1-3/4 percent pace.",2002-10-23
"Then, for the quarter century following World War II, productivity growth rose to an average rate of 2-3/4 percent before subsiding to a pace of 1-1/2 percent annually from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s.3 Arguably, the pickup in productivity growth since 1995 largely reflects the ongoing incorporation of innovations in computing and communications technologies into the capital stock and business practices.",2002-10-23
"Indeed, the transition to the higher permanent level of productivity associated with these innovations is likely not yet completed.",2002-10-23
"If the backlog of unexploited long-term profitable technologies remains high, it should be assumed that once currently elevated risk premiums and the heightened cost of equity capital (and some debt) recedes, or cash flows expand, new productivity-enhancing capital investment will pick up.",2002-10-23
"Further evidence that firms still have not fully adapted their operations to the latest state of technology also is provided in a recent study4 that attempts to measure the ""technological gap""--that is, the difference between the productivity of leading-edge capital and the average productivity embodied in the current capital stock.",2002-10-23
"This gap is estimated to be quite wide currently, which suggests that there are still significant opportunities for firms to upgrade the quality of their technology and with it the level of productivity.",2002-10-23
The paper presented by Stephen Oliner and Dan Sichel this morning also provides a basis for arguing that a significant portion--and possibly all--of the productivity revival of the mid-1990s is sustainable.,2002-10-23
"Based on an analysis of a multisector growth model, their work suggests that a range for sustainable growth in labor productivity over the next decade is 2 percent to 2-3/4 percent per year.",2002-10-23
"Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh use a similar methodology and find a range from a little less than 1-1/2 percent to about 3 percent with a central tendency of around 2-1/4 percent.5 These estimates are clearly plausible, but history does raise some warning flags concerning the length of time that productivity growth continues elevated.",2002-10-23
Gains in productivity remained quite rapid for years after the innovations that followed the surge of inventions a century ago.,2002-10-23
"But in other episodes, the period of elevated growth of productivity was shorter.",2002-10-23
"* * * In summary then: given the difficult adjustments that our economy has been undergoing, long-term productivity optimism may currently seem a bit out of place.",2002-10-23
"Nevertheless, it is both remarkable and encouraging that, despite all that has transpired over the past couple of years, a significant step-up in the growth of productivity appears to have persisted.",2002-10-23
"But that output was misused does not subtract from the evident capacity to produce that output, and it is this that our measures of structural productivity attempt to capture.",2002-10-23
"Susanto Basu, John Fernald, and Matthew Shapiro, in their paper ""Productivity Growth in the 1990s: Technology, Utilization, or Adjustment?,"" Carnegie Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy, (April 2001) pp.",2002-10-23
"In contrast to the boom in productivity after World War I, which many economists associate with a few key innovations, analysts usually ascribe the post-World War II boom to innovations in many sectors reflecting the diffusion through the private economy of (a) new technologies that appeared in the 1930s but were not fully implemented during the Depression, and (b) a gradual application to civilian activities of military-related innovations.",2002-10-23
"Rather than expecting the stream of surpluses projected just three years ago, budget analysts now expect sizable deficits for at least the remainder of the decade.",2004-06-24
"Fiscal policy can have important long-run effects on the health of the economy, particularly through its impact on national saving and the growth of productivity.",2004-06-24
"When the government runs deficits, it siphons off private savings (reducing national saving), leaving less available for capital investment.",2004-06-24
"With less capital investment, less new equipment is provided to workers, and, all else being equal, future productivity growth rates and levels are lower.",2004-06-24
Productivity growth is the principal source of improvement in economic well-being.,2004-06-24
"The faster productivity increases over time, the more rapidly living standards increase.",2004-06-24
Maintaining a rapid rate of trend productivity growth is particularly important in light of the coming budgetary pressures associated with the retirement of the baby boom generation.,2004-06-24
"To be sure, budget deficits are not always inappropriate, and to a certain extent, the recent fiscal deficits have helped limit the recent economic slowdown.",2004-06-24
"Specifically, it is time to bring the budget deficits under control.",2004-06-24
But the manner in which the process of deficit reduction is framed can strongly influence the likelihood of success.,2004-06-24
"The CBO and the JCT provide credible estimates of taxes, spending, and deficits based on a common set of assumptions.",2004-06-24
"For example, by today's cash-based yardstick, the federal budget posted surpluses from 1998 to 2001; yet, if the budget definitions had included the costs of future Medicare and Social Security benefits accrued over this period, the budget likely would have shown substantial deficits.",2004-06-24
"In short, although cash deficits have economic relevance, they can provide a misleading picture of the nation's long-term budgetary situation.",2004-06-24
Should the Congress try to target a better measure of the fiscal situation than the deficit as it is currently defined?,2004-06-24
"Some have suggested moving to an accrual-based accounting system, where the deficit would better account for future obligations and revenues.",2004-06-24
"For example, to calculate generational accounts, one must specify the future path of numerous economic and demographic variables like wages, capital income, immigration, longevity, health costs, and inflation.1 One must also specify a discount rate in order to calculate present values--a choice that would likely be controversial and that could greatly affect the results.",2004-06-24
"Thus, they measure the fiscal burden under the assumption that current tax policy is continued, Social Security benefits are not curtailed, and Medicare spending continues to rise with health costs.2 The information provided by generational accounts and other similar methods would definitely be valuable, but their computational methods seem too complicated and rely too much on assumptions about future variables to make them a viable alternative to the current deficit as the main benchmark of fiscal policy.",2004-06-24
Overall Deficit Targets A second approach to controlling budget deficits is for the Congress to establish budget targets.,2004-06-24
This approach was the centerpiece of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985--commonly known as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings (GRH) Act.,2004-06-24
That act aimed to wipe out the deficit in five years.,2004-06-24
It did so by establishing annual targets--declining to zero--for the budget deficit.,2004-06-24
"The process worked as follows: If projected deficits in the next fiscal year exceeded the targets by $10 billion or more, the legislation mandated that unprotected programs be cut, across-the-board, and by enough to reach the legislated targets.",2004-06-24
GRH did not allow changes in external circumstances to affect the budget deficit targets.,2004-06-24
Spending cuts were to be enforced regardless of whether the deficit picture had deteriorated because of worsening economic circumstances or because of congressional action.,2004-06-24
"The actual deficit did not meet the target in any of the years GRH was law, in part because, during this period, external events, such as the savings and loan crisis, tended to overtake the policies that the Congress had enacted to try to close the budget gaps.",2004-06-24
"For example, the Stability and Growth Pact of the European Monetary Union specifies that the budget deficits of member countries are not to exceed 3 percent of GDP except under some special circumstances.",2004-06-24
"But the Stability and Growth Pact has been as ineffective as GRH has, and for the same reasons: Countries have resorted to budgetary gimmicks to meet the criteria, and the sanctions have not been imposed on countries that have not met their targets.",2004-06-24
"Another example of deficit targets comes from the balanced-budget requirements of the states, which can be viewed as deficit targets with the target set at zero.",2004-06-24
"Although states have a wide array of budgetary tricks they can and do employ to hit their deficit targets, research evidence suggests that the balanced-budget requirements do limit borrowing and that, as a result, states with more stringent requirements face somewhat lower borrowing costs.",2004-06-24
"Furthermore, there seems to be a deeply held consensus that state budgets should be balanced, and this consensus undoubtedly helps legislators make the difficult choices sometimes necessary to balance state budgets.3 Hence, it may seem attractive just to limit overall deficits, but such limits have had only mixed success.",2004-06-24
"In a political setting, inflexible deficit limits are likely to lead more to avoidance than to real changes.",2004-06-24
This legislation replaced the system of deficit targets with two types of restraints on legislative actions.,2004-06-24
"Second, for revenues and entitlement programs, the BEA established a system called PAYGO (pay as you go) that required all revenue and mandatory spending legislation to be deficit-neutral over a five-year period.",2004-06-24
"In other words, the PAYGO restraint didn't require the Congress to climb out of the deficit hole by any particular date, but it did prohibit the Congress from digging the hole any deeper.",2004-06-24
"Changes in the deficit resulting from changes in economic conditions, health prices, demographics, and other technical or economic factors were allowed to show through to the deficit without sanction.",2004-06-24
Budget deficits declined sharply from 1992 to 1997 and then turned to surpluses from 1998 through 2001.,2004-06-24
"To a significant extent, of course, the decline in the deficit and the emergence of surpluses were attributable to circumstances external to the budget process, including the stellar performance of the economy; the increase in equity prices, which raised tax revenues to historic highs; and the end of the Cold War, which allowed for a decrease in defense spending.",2004-06-24
"But without a broad consensus to reduce the deficit, and without a mechanism to enforce that consensus, the Congress might have responded to these positive developments by increasing spending or cutting taxes.",2004-06-24
"Instead, the federal deficit was allowed to decline.",2004-06-24
"As a result, national saving increased, providing further impetus to economic growth.",2004-06-24
It is difficult to know exactly what the deficit path would have been in the absence of the BEA.,2004-06-24
But budget experts generally believe that the BEA did help to reduce deficits.,2004-06-24
"First, any individual representative knows that bringing home the pork is not likely to have much of an effect on the deficit.",2004-06-24
"As already noted, an advantage of the budget rules was that they aimed at constraining the things that the Congress could control directly rather than targeting the overall level of the deficit.",2004-06-24
"But unfortunately, even when surpluses emerged, the PAYGO rules continued to require deficit neutrality in mandatory spending and revenue programs and adherence to the discretionary caps.",2004-06-24
"In order to be effective, the process must be based on reliable information about current and future baseline budget deficits and about the effects of legislation on the budget.",2004-06-24
"Once some success has been achieved with these measures, it may be easier to tackle the more ambitious step of instituting overall deficit limits.",2004-06-24
"The current focus on five years may be a reasonable compromise, or it might be worth considering some more-complicated rules that might limit annual deficits as well as five- or ten-year totals.",2004-06-24
"In the past, a reasonable goal might have been to maintain a zero deficit in our on-budget accounts--those accounts that exclude the Social Security and Medicare surplus--and to begin a serious discussion of reforms to Social Security and Medicare to bring them closer into actuarial balance.",2004-06-24
"As we progress through the eighth year of the current economic expansion, economic growth has continued at a robust pace with unemployment reaching a 28-year low, while inflation has remained remarkably subdued.",1998-07-09
"Although the recent surprises of both low unemployment and well-behaved inflation have been quite favorable, they have been surprises nonetheless and not easily reconcilable with each other based on old relationships and our earlier assessment of the economy's potential.",1998-07-09
These developments have increased the uncertainty about the economic outlook and about the appropriate response of monetary policy in general to new developments.,1998-07-09
I want to take this opportunity to discuss some implications of this increased uncertainty for the conduct of monetary policy.,1998-07-09
"Objectives and Strategy for Monetary Policy To evaluate the proper strategy for monetary policy, we must first understand the Federal Reserve's policy objectives and then recognize the parameters within which policy operates in attaining these objectives.",1998-07-09
The long-run goal of monetary policy is straightforward.,1998-07-09
The Federal Reserve Act mandates that we promote price stability and maximum employment.,1998-07-09
"Sometimes this dual objective is misunderstood, with the misconception that these inflation and employment goals cannot be attained simultaneously--that there is a tradeoff in the long run between one and the other.",1998-07-09
It is worthwhile repeating what I am sure all of you already understand well: the long-run goals of price stability and maximum employment are not mutually exclusive.,1998-07-09
"Not so long ago, mainstream macroeconomists thought that employment and growth were by and large independent of inflation in the long run.",1998-07-09
But the evidence accumulating in the 1990s seems to suggest that low inflation contributes to real economic performance in ways not fully appreciated before.,1998-07-09
"If anything, our approach to price stability, by reducing uncertainty and making long-run savings and investment decisions easier, seems to have enhanced the growth of productivity, real GDP, and employment.",1998-07-09
"This indirect benefit, of course, reenforces the price stability goal.",1998-07-09
"It is the rate of inflation that monetary policy determines in the long run, and this means that price stability in a straightforward way is elevated to the status of the primary long-run goal of monetary policy.",1998-07-09
"In the shorter run, inflation may rise and fall depending on where the economy is operating relative to its potential.",1998-07-09
"When the economy has become overextended, with output exceeding the economy's potential, employment beyond sustainable norms, and production surpassing normal capacity limits, then prices have tended to increase at an ever faster rate.",1998-07-09
"Likewise, when aggregate demand has fallen short of the economy's potential, inflation has tended to fall.",1998-07-09
And this is where the short-run setting of monetary policy comes into play.,1998-07-09
"By moving short-term interest rates, monetary policy can affect other financial conditions and end up exerting a substantial influence on aggregate demand.",1998-07-09
Decisions by businesses about investment and by households about housing and consumption are altered by changes in interest rates and other credit conditions.,1998-07-09
Monetary policy also can indirectly impinge upon other components of aggregate demand.,1998-07-09
"As a result, in the shorter run, monetary policy can play an important role in stabilizing the economy from undesired fluctuations in economic activity and inflation.",1998-07-09
The strategy for monetary policy geared towards these shorter-run concerns can be briefly described.,1998-07-09
It is to restrict monetary conditions when the economy seems on the way to becoming overheated and inflation is threatening and ease monetary conditions when signs of weakness in demand appear on the horizon.,1998-07-09
But it is important that we pursue these short-run goals keeping in mind our primary long-run goal of price stability.,1998-07-09
"Of course, other forces besides the state of the economy relative to its potential can influence inflation in the short run.",1998-07-09
"Even prior to the anomalous experience of recent years, which I will discuss later in detail, supply shocks, such as a sudden hike in oil prices, have dramatically affected inflation.",1998-07-09
"Such forces can also cause short-term fluctuations in the economy that are, at least in part, beyond the control of monetary policy.",1998-07-09
"However, active stabilization policy may still have a role to play as a buffer, helping the economy to absorb such disturbances in the short run, while counteracting any persistent deviations from price stability.",1998-07-09
"But monetary policy operates with a long lag, with a policy change exhibiting material effects on the economy (excluding the immediate impact on financial markets) only several quarters after its implementation.",1998-07-09
"By some estimates it may be almost a year before the brunt of the effect of an interest rate change is felt on aggregate demand, although the influence appears sooner in some sectors of the economy than in others.",1998-07-09
And it may generally take longer still for a policy change to alter the course of inflation.,1998-07-09
"Consequently, active stabilization policy is most successful when it is preemptive, responding to early warning signals or forecasts of unfavorable developments on the inflation and employment fronts.",1998-07-09
"Based on these forecasts we can then take steps to adjust the stance of monetary policy as necessary, in accordance with our objectives.",1998-07-09
"Uncertainties: Old and New To be useful for monetary policy, forecasts of the future health of the economy need to be reasonably reliable.",1998-07-09
"If monetary policy were naively to follow guidelines based on past regularities that are increasingly failing to reflect new realities, it would unintentionally introduce undesirable gyrations in the economy.",1998-07-09
"In recent years, traditional views of the economy perhaps have been most challenged by the phenomenon of declining inflation despite increasing tightness in labor markets as evidenced by reductions in the unemployment rate to its lowest level in almost three decades.",1998-07-09
"Many believe that there is an unemployment rate, the nonaccelerating-inflation rate of unemployment (the ""NAIRU""), that would be consistent with a stable inflation rate, once other short-run influences on inflation dissipate.",1998-07-09
"To these economists, inflationary pressures tend to increase when unemployment remains below the NAIRU and tend to decrease when unemployment stays above the NAIRU.",1998-07-09
"Since 1995, however, the unemployment rate has been below this level, and substantially below of late, while inflation has continued to progress toward our price-stability objective.",1998-07-09
Yet considerable uncertainty remains about the confidence with which the new estimates can be relied upon for evaluating inflationary pressures.,1998-07-09
A related uncertainty concerns the underlying trend growth of labor productivity.,1998-07-09
"But there are many that believe that a pickup may have occurred in the last few years, and a faster productivity trend would help to explain the unexpectedly favorable economic growth-unemployment-inflation nexus in recent years.",1998-07-09
"Unfortunately, much as with the NAIRU, our understanding of the forces that drive the productivity trend is less than perfect.",1998-07-09
"Certainly, the investment boom of the current expansion has raised the amount of capital for each worker and contributed to an increase in labor productivity, and it may be that advancing technology is making the capital stock and workforce more productive.",1998-07-09
"However, some of the recent pickup in productivity is the normal response to the faster output growth of late, so the degree to which there is a new higher trend remains an open question.",1998-07-09
"Another difficulty in assessing the current amount of slack in the economy, and a third uncertainty, concerns the divergent patterns in alternative measures of excess demand.",1998-07-09
Capacity utilization in manufacturing and the rate of unemployment have historically moved together over the cycle.,1998-07-09
Recent developments in Southeast Asia also have contributed to uncertainty about the current monetary policy environment.,1998-07-09
One place where the effect of the crisis is being felt is in the prices of primary commodities.,1998-07-09
"Since such commodities are traded on world markets, lower demand from Asia is reflected in lower prices world-wide, which benefit U.S. producers that use commodities as inputs.",1998-07-09
"This development serves as a short-run boost, a positive supply shock, to the U.S. economy, one that also helps contain inflationary pressures, as does the more general decline in import prices as the U.S. dollar appreciates.",1998-07-09
"With little historical guidance to draw from, however, considerable uncertainty prevails regarding the extent to which the present Asian situation may contribute to slower U.S. growth as well as the timing of such a slowdown.",1998-07-09
"For instance, despite expectations that the crisis would have contributed to a slowdown in economic activity earlier this year, the economy's growth in the first quarter of this year exceeded even the remarkable performance of 1997.",1998-07-09
"Following a period of rapid productivity gains during the 1950s and 1960s, the economy's performance during the 1970s appeared out of line with previous experience.",1998-07-09
"Starting in 1973, in particular, inflation rose more than expected, at times considerably so, while economic growth tended to disappoint expectations for a number of years.",1998-07-09
"At first, it appeared reasonable to assume that the observed productivity slowdown was temporary.",1998-07-09
"Reflecting this assumption, for instance, the Council of Economic Advisors gave a 4 percent estimate of potential output growth in the 1974 Economic Report of the President, as would have been consistent with the earlier trends.",1998-07-09
"Increased uncertainty regarding this estimate was evident in the 1975 and 1976 Reports, but not until 1977 was the point estimate of potential output growth revised downward, to 3.6 percent.",1998-07-09
Only several years after the fact was a trend break in productivity recognized as likely to have occurred in 1973.,1998-07-09
"As inflation accelerated as the 1970s continued, critics blamed the Federal Reserve's operating procedures for placing too little weight on money growth and too much on interest rates in the conduct of policy.",1998-07-09
"In response, the Federal Reserve in late 1979 put added emphasis on monetary growth targets.",1998-07-09
But the FOMC abandoned the strict regime of targeting M1 through reserve quantities in 1982 once evidence accumulated that the character of M1 demand had been altered by the spread of interest-bearing NOW accounts.,1998-07-09
"In terms of the performance of inflation and unemployment, the experience of the past few years has not been unlike a mirror image of the 1970s.",1998-07-09
"While the consequences are a lot more pleasant, unexpectedly low inflation and unemployment do raise some complicated issues for monetary policy.",1998-07-09
Strategy in Uncertain Times: Caution and Vigilance This account of the sources of uncertainty that we face in designing the proper course of monetary policy should not leave the impression that our task is so daunting that the policy waters are unnavigable.,1998-07-09
"In the current context, the considerable uncertainty regarding our previous estimates of the capacity of the economy and its sustainable rate of growth in my judgment suggest the need to downplay forecasts of inflation based on those earlier assessments.",1998-07-09
"By necessity, I believe heightened reliance needs to be placed on more recent observations of inflation and costs for inferring future inflationary pressures.",1998-07-09
"We are not precluded from acting preemptively if new information were to tip the balance of risks in the outlook toward higher inflation, but are naturally a little more cautious in acting on forecasts as long as substantial uncertainty persists.",1998-07-09
"And, in my judgment, we may have to rely more on measures other than apparent excess demand to get reliable indications of pending changes in inflationary pressures.",1998-07-09
"For instance, unit labor costs may have to be watched especially closely, and the rate of unemployment perhaps less closely than we are used to.",1998-07-09
But a pattern of unsustainable growth characterized by a continuously declining unemployment rate still may increasingly suggest greater inflation risk.,1998-07-09
"Even if the limits of the economy's growth potential have moved, there are still limits that need to be respected.",1998-07-09
"The increased uncertainty also implies that continued strong economic growth with low inflation is not outside the realm of possibility, and by adopting a cautious policy posture we may learn more clearly if that possibility is likely or remote.",1998-07-09
"It is important, however, that these jobs be the result of sustainable growth, and not the result of excesses and imbalances.",1998-07-09
"However, caution can be excessive, running the risk that inflation may in fact reappear and require a more wrenching readjustment than if it had been anticipated.",1998-07-09
"Moreover, we must be willing to act forcefully if information suggesting a threat to our goal of price stability becomes available.",1998-07-09
"Inflation is an insidious tax on all of our citizens, perhaps impacting low- and moderate-income citizens more than others because there are fewer ways available to them to protect their income and their assets against an erosion of purchasing power.",1998-07-09
"If evidence of an incipient rise in inflation were to appear, decisive action would provide a counterweight to minimize the building of a temporary inflationary aberration into inflation expectations, which could be disruptive.",1998-07-09
"Conclusion A string of favorable surprises yielding strong growth, high employment and low inflation is by far the most pleasant environment under which to come to the realization that our understanding of the workings of our complex economy is not infallible.",1998-07-09
A sound economy with subdued inflation makes dealing with the greater uncertainty much easier indeed!,1998-07-09

"April 05, 2022 Variation in the Inflation Experiences of Households Governor Lael Brainard At the Spring 2022 Institute Research Conference, Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, Minneapolis, Minnesota (via webcast) Share Watch Live It is a pleasure to join you to discuss differences in how households at different income levels experience inflation.1 I look forward to hearing from the panelists, who are doing important and interesting research on this topic.",2022-04-05
"By law, the Federal Reserve is assigned the responsibility to pursue price stability and maximum employment.",2022-04-05
"The Federal Open Market Committee (the Committee) has long recognized the connection between stable, low inflation and maximum employment.",2022-04-05
"Forty years ago, Paul Volcker noted that the dual mandate isn't an either-or proposition and that runaway inflation ""would be the greatest threat to the continuing growth of the economyâ€¦ and ultimately, to employment.",2022-04-05
"""2 Maximum employment and stable, low inflation benefit all Americans, but are particularly important for low- and moderate-income families.",2022-04-05
"The combination of good job opportunities and stable, low inflation provides purchasing power to fill up gas tanks and grocery carts and pay housing and medical costs, leaving room to build emergency cushions and invest in education; retirement; and, for some, small businesses.",2022-04-05
"Indeed, the Employment Act of 1946 called on the federal government to promote ""maximum employment, production, and purchasing power.",2022-04-05
"""3 While national data do not directly disaggregate the differential effects of inflation by household income groups, a variety of evidence suggests that lower-income households disproportionately feel the burden of high inflation.",2022-04-05
Lower-income families expend a greater share of their income on necessities; have smaller financial cushions; and may have less ability to switch to lower-priced alternatives.,2022-04-05
"Arthur Burns noted in the late 1960s that ""there can be little doubt that poor peopleâ€¦are the chief sufferers of inflation.",2022-04-05
"""4 Today, inflation is very high, particularly for food and gasoline.",2022-04-05
"All Americans are confronting higher prices, but the burden is particularly great for households with more limited resources.",2022-04-05
"That is why getting inflation down is our most important task, while sustaining a recovery that includes everyone.",2022-04-05
"In assessing inflation faced by American consumers, economists and policymakers generally rely on the change in the consumer price index (CPI) or the change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE).5 Since January 2012, the Committee's price-stability goal has been specified as a longer-run goal of 2 percent in terms of annual PCE inflation.6 Both CPI and PCE inflation metrics are assembled from a collection of underlying elementary price indexes for narrow subsets of goods and services.7 The price changes each month for the goods and services in these subsets are combined into measures of overall inflation by calculating a weighted average of all these subindexes, where the weights are based on average aggregate consumer expenditures in each category.",2022-04-05
"This measure is particularly useful, for example, in adjusting measures of overall expenditure for changes in prices to determine how much real growth has occurred between two periods.",2022-04-05
Households Have Different Inflation Experiences Each household in the United States has a particular consumption bundle whose prices and quantities combine to make up that household's cost of living.,2022-04-05
The change in such a cost-of-living index would represent the average inflation experienced by U.S. households.,2022-04-05
"Instead, because the CPI and PCE indexes weight every dollar of expenditure equally, these indexes implicitly weight each household's cost of living proportionally to their total expenditure.8 Since lower-income households represent a relatively smaller share of overall expenditure, the inflation associated with their consumption baskets is underrepresented in the official consumer price indexes.",2022-04-05
"It would be useful to have data about consumer inflation broken out by demographic groups, similar to labor market and personal-income data, in order to assess the differential effect of inflation across different groups of households.9 U.S. statistical agencies do not collect the information needed to accurately assess inflation at a household level, and it would require a large change in the way these agencies go about their work to do so.",2022-04-05
"Nonetheless, recent research has begun to assess variation in the ways different households experience inflation.",2022-04-05
Households at different income levels could experience differential inflation effects for several reasons: Consumption shares could differ systematically for low- and high-income households; the goods and services within each consumption category could differ; the ability to substitute for lower-priced alternatives of the same item could differ; and prices paid for the same good could differ systematically due to differences in access.,2022-04-05
"First, low- and moderate-income households could experience inflation that diverges from the average because their consumption baskets differ systematically from the average.",2022-04-05
10 Lower-income households spend 77 percent of their income on necessitiesâ€”more than double the 31 percent of income spent by higher-income households on these categories.11 Several studies have found that the consumption baskets of lower-income households have experienced higher-than-average inflation rates over time.,2022-04-05
Research from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has examined the effect of different consumption baskets by using the same elementary price indexes as used in the official CPI but assigning the weights of these components to reflect the consumption bundles of different types of households.,2022-04-05
"A 2021 working paper by BLS staff based on data from 2003 to 2018 found that a price index reflecting the consumption basket for households in the lowest-income quartile grew faster than the overall CPI, while a price index reflecting the consumption basket for households in the highest-income quartile grew more slowly than the overall CPI.12 A 2015 BLS study found a similar result using data from 1982 to 2014.13 Of course, the recent sharp increases in inflation may have affected the consumption bundles of lower-income households relative to the average differently than in previous cycles.",2022-04-05
"While these studies allow for differences in the weighting of price indexes across different income groups, they rely on the same elementary price indexes for subcategories of goods and services.",2022-04-05
"As a result, they may miss additional sources of variation in the inflation rates experienced by households at different income levels.",2022-04-05
"The demand and supply dynamics for those products are likely quite different, meaning that their relative price dynamics are poorly described by a single index.",2022-04-05
"Third, households at different income levels may have differing abilities to substitute for lower-priced alternatives within an elementary category.",2022-04-05
Consider a price increase for a breakfast cereal that increases the prices of both the brand-name cereal and the corresponding lower-priced store-brand cereal but maintains a differential between them.,2022-04-05
"A household that had been purchasing brand-name cereal could save money by purchasing store-brand cereal instead, perhaps even eliminating any effect of the price increase on their actual spending while purchasing the same quantity of cereal in that narrow category.",2022-04-05
"Finally, beyond the variation in inflation that comes from households buying different goods, research also shows that differences in inflation can result from households paying different prices for identical goods.",2022-04-05
"Using transaction-level data, researchers found that almost two-thirds of the variation in inflation across households comes from differences in prices paid for identical goods, with only about one-third coming from differences in the mix of goods within broad categories.14 As a result of these differences, households with lower incomes, more household members, or older household heads experienced higher inflation on average.",2022-04-05
"Variations in the prices paid for identical goods could reflect differences in the ability of some households to stock up when prices are discounted or to buy in bulk and saveâ€”options only available to households with the means to buy in larger quantities, adequate capacity to store larger quantities, or the flexibility to delay purchases if there is an opportunity to save in the future.",2022-04-05
"In addition, evidence suggests that inflation could be lower for items purchased online rather than from brick-and-mortar stores, suggesting that households who do not have full access to online shopping options could face a higher cost of living.",2022-04-05
"One study of online transactions made between 2014 and 2017 found that online inflation averaged more than 1 percentage point per year lower than the equivalent CPI measure of the relevant product categories.15 We are only beginning to understand the ways in which inflation experiences vary from household to household, how this variation correlates with income and demographic information, and how these divergent inflation experiences change over time.16 This developing area of research will benefit from conferences like this one that help expand the frontier of our knowledge about the heterogeneity of experienced inflation.",2022-04-05
Implications for the Outlook and Policy High inflation places a burden on working families who are concerned about how far their paychecks will stretch as well as seniors living on fixed incomes.,2022-04-05
So now let me turn briefly to what we are seeing on inflation and the outlook for jobs and growth.,2022-04-05
Headline PCE inflation for February came in at 6.4 percent on a 12-month basis.,2022-04-05
"Food and energy account for an outsized one-fourth share of this high level of inflation and also constitute an outsized share of expenditure for lower-income Americans, who spend 26 percent of their income on food at home and transportation, compared with 9 percent for high-income Americans.17 Core inflation is also elevated, and inflationary pressures have been broadening out.",2022-04-05
"Housing contributed about one-tenth of total PCE inflation in February and is the single greatest category of expenditures by far for lower-income Americans, who spend 45 percent of their income on housing, compared to 18 percent for high-income Americans.18 Durable goods inflation, particularly in autos, accounted for slightly more than one-fifth of total PCE inflation in February, representing a much greater contribution to inflation than was the case pre-pandemic.",2022-04-05
High durable goods inflation reflects pandemic-related supply constraints as well as persistently elevated demand associated with the pandemic.,2022-04-05
"I will be carefully monitoring the extent to which demand rotates back to services and away from durable goods, where it has remained consistently above pre-pandemic levels, and the extent to which the services sector is able to absorb higher demand without generating undue inflationary pressure.",2022-04-05
The global commodity supply shock associated with Russia's actions skews inflation risks to the upside and is expected to exacerbate high prices for gasoline and food as well as supply chain bottlenecks in goods sectors.,2022-04-05
These geopolitical events also pose downside risks to growth.,2022-04-05
"That said, the U.S. economy entered this period of uncertainty with considerable momentum in demand and a strong labor market.",2022-04-05
"As of the March labor report, payroll employment has increased at a pace of 600,000 jobs per month over the past six months, and the unemployment rate has fallen by a percentage point over that period and is now close to its pre-pandemic level.",2022-04-05
"An increase in labor supply associated with diminishing pandemic constraints combined with a moderation in demand associated with tightening financial conditions, slowing foreign growth, and a large decrease in fiscal support could be expected to reduce imbalances later in the year.",2022-04-05
It is of paramount importance to get inflation down.,2022-04-05
"Accordingly, the Committee will continue tightening monetary policy methodically through a series of interest rate increases and by starting to reduce the balance sheet at a rapid pace as soon as our May meeting.",2022-04-05
The reduction in the balance sheet will contribute to monetary policy tightening over and above the expected increases in the policy rate reflected in market pricing and the Committee's Summary of Economic Projections.,2022-04-05
"I expect the combined effect of rate increases and balance sheet reduction to bring the stance of policy to a more neutral position later this year, with the full extent of additional tightening over time dependent on how the outlook for inflation and employment evolves.",2022-04-05
"For today, every indicator of longer-term inflation expectations lies within the range of historical values consistent with our 2 percent target.",2022-04-05
"Currently, inflation is much too high and is subject to upside risks.",2022-04-05
The Committee is prepared to take stronger action if indicators of inflation and inflation expectations indicate that such action is warranted.,2022-04-05
"We are committed to bringing inflation back down to its 2 percent target, recognizing that stable low inflation is vital to maintaining a strong economy and a labor market that works for everyone.",2022-04-05
"See the Declaration of Policy on page 1 of the Employment Act of 1946, available at https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/files/docs/historical/congressional/employment-act-1946.pdf.",2022-04-05

"Because long-term interest rates can remain low only in a stable macroeconomic environment, these goals are often referred to as the dual mandate; that is, the Federal Reserve seeks to promote the two coequal objectives of maximum employment and price stability.",2007-04-10
"Now with respect to the first objective, the rationale for maximizing employment is fairly obvious.",2007-04-10
"The alternative situation--high unemployment--is associated with human misery, including lower living standards and increases in poverty as well as social pathologies such as loss of self-esteem, a higher incidence of divorce, increased rates of violent crime, and even suicide.",2007-04-10
"Furthermore, when unemployment is high, the economy has idle workers along with a reduced level of production and household income.",2007-04-10
"And when factories are idle, firms generally choose not to invest in additional plant and equipment, which in turn has adverse consequences for subsequent labor productivity and economic growth.",2007-04-10
"All these symptoms of high unemployment were observed during the economic devastation of the Great Depression during the 1930s, which is now just a fading memory.",2007-04-10
"With respect to the second objective--that of price stability--there is now a broad consensus among policymakers, academic economists, and the general public in support of the principle that maintaining a low and stable inflation rate provides lasting benefits to the economy.",2007-04-10
"In particular, low and predictable inflation promotes social welfare by simplifying the savings and retirement planning of individual households and by facilitating firms' production and investment decisions.",2007-04-10
"Furthermore, an environment of overall price stability contributes to economic efficiency by reducing the variability of relative prices and by minimizing the distortions that arise because the tax system is not completely indexed to inflation.",2007-04-10
Price stability also has important benefits in terms of equity.,2007-04-10
"For example, an elevated inflation rate typically increases poverty because the poorest members of society do not have access to the sorts of financial instruments that would help protect them against inflation.",2007-04-10
"By the way, these are not just theoretical arguments: The experience of the United States in the 1970s, and that of many other economies across a wide range of times and circumstances, demonstrates that high and unstable inflation generally detracts from the standard of living, hinders the process of capital formation and economic growth, and in some countries has even led to political and social instability.",2007-04-10
Such episodes also show that a full recovery from the adverse effects of severe inflation can take many years.,2007-04-10
"Of course, the Federal Reserve doesn't take a literal approach to the goal of maximum employment.",2007-04-10
"Furthermore, every modern economy has a certain level of ""frictional"" unemployment, which reflects the transitory periods over which individuals remain voluntarily unemployed while searching for a new job.",2007-04-10
"Partly for these reasons, Federal Reserve officials and other policymakers often refer to this aspect of the dual mandate as the goal of maximum sustainable employment, and they place particular emphasis on the word sustainable.",2007-04-10
"Similarly, in promoting the goal of price stability, policymakers have generally not taken this goal literally--by aiming at complete constancy of the price level--but instead have pursued policies aimed at maintaining a low and predictable inflation rate.",2007-04-10
"In particular, at a congressional hearing in mid-1988, then-Chairman Greenspan defined price stability as an environment in which households and businesses ""can safely ignore the possibility of sustained, generalized price increases or decreases"" in making their saving and investment decisions.2 Now let's turn to the practical challenges in conducting monetary policy to achieve the dual mandate.",2007-04-10
"A central element in successful monetary policy is a strong commitment to a nominal anchor, that is, the use of monetary policy actions and statements to maintain low and stable inflation.",2007-04-10
"During the 1980s and 1990s, the Federal Reserve succeeded in bringing inflation down from double-digit levels to the average rate of about 2 percent that has prevailed over the past decade.",2007-04-10
"Moreover, when some measures of inflation were close to 1 percent in 2003, the Federal Open Market Committee's official statements specifically noted that any further substantial decline in inflation would be unwelcome, mainly because of the risk that a falling price level (which has not occurred since the Great Depression) could cause a significant disruption to economic activity and employment.",2007-04-10
"Not only has the inflation rate remained within a reasonably narrow range, but inflation expectations, as measured by spreads between inflation-indexed and non-inflation-indexed Treasury securities and by surveys of professional forecasters and the general public, have also been well anchored.",2007-04-10
"Maintaining price stability is also essential for achieving the other element of the dual mandate, namely, maximum sustainable employment.",2007-04-10
"First, as I have already emphasized, a low and predictable inflation rate plays a crucial role in facilitating long-term growth in employment and labor productivity.",2007-04-10
"Second, although the economy will inevitably be buffeted by various shocks, in the majority of circumstances the appropriate monetary policy response to stabilize inflation also helps to stabilize employment and output fluctuations around their maximum sustainable levels.",2007-04-10
"To see how a commitment to price stability leads to appropriate policy actions to stabilize employment and output fluctuations, we need to understand that there are two key determinants of inflation: inflation expectations and the amount of slack in the economy.3 Maintaining a nominal anchor helps stabilize inflation expectations, which in turn means that rises or falls in inflation tend to be highly correlated with economic slack.",2007-04-10
"Thus, stabilizing inflation also helps to stabilize economic activity around sustainable levels.",2007-04-10
"To see further how this process would work, consider a negative shock to aggregate demand (such as a decline in consumer confidence) that causes households to cut spending.",2007-04-10
"The drop in demand leads, in turn, to a decline in actual output relative to its potential, that is, the level of output that the economy can produce at the maximum sustainable level of employment.",2007-04-10
"As a result, future inflation will fall below levels consistent with price stability, and the central bank will pursue an expansionary policy to keep inflation from falling.",2007-04-10
The expansionary policy will then result in an increase in demand that raises output back up to potential output in order to return inflation to a level consistent with price stability.,2007-04-10
"For example, during the last recession the Federal Reserve reduced its target for the federal funds rate a total of 5-1/2 percentage points, and this stimulus not only contributed to economic recovery but also helped avoid an unwelcome further decline in inflation.",2007-04-10
"In other cases, a tightening of the stance of monetary policy is needed to prevent an ""overheating"" of economic activity, thereby avoiding a boom-bust cycle in the level of employment as well as an undesirable upward spurt of inflation.",2007-04-10
A strong commitment to price stability helps reduce fluctuations in employment and output in other ways.,2007-04-10
"First, when inflation expectations are well anchored, a central bank will not have to worry that expansionary policy to counter a negative demand shock will lead to a sharp rise in expected inflation--a so-called inflation scare--that will then push up actual inflation in the future.",2007-04-10
"Thus, a strong commitment to a nominal anchor enables a central bank to be more aggressive in the face of negative shocks and therefore to prevent rapid declines in employment or output.",2007-04-10
"Moreover, with a strong commitment to a nominal anchor, supply shocks to inflation, such as a rise in relative energy prices, are likely to have only a temporary effect on inflation.",2007-04-10
"Because people are confident that the Fed will not allow inflation to remain high, the recent sharp run-up in oil prices did not lead to a sustained rise in longer-run inflation expectations.",2007-04-10
"As a result, inflation rose temporarily but has now been falling back again.",2007-04-10
"When inflation expectations are well-anchored, the occurrence of an adverse aggregate supply shock does not necessarily mean that the central bank must raise interest rates aggressively in order to keep inflation under control, and hence the commitment to price stability can help avoid imposing unnecessary harm on the economy and on the workers who are most vulnerable to a weakening of economic activity.",2007-04-10
"Now that we see the benefits of maintaining a commitment to a nominal anchor, one might naturally think that there would also be benefits to establishing a similar sort of anchor for the maximum level of employment.",2007-04-10
"In particular, although the Federal Reserve can determine and achieve the long-run average rate of inflation in keeping with its mandate of price stability, the level of maximum sustainable employment is not something that can be chosen by the Federal Reserve because no central bank can control the level of real economic activity or employment over the longer run.",2007-04-10
"In assessing the economic outlook, economists cannot avoid confronting the question of how fast the economy can expand without creating upward pressure on inflation.",2004-07-07

"The Past 1 Over the past century and a half, three episodes stand out as especially relevant for assessing the sustainability of the current productivity boom: the late 1800s from roughly the end of the Civil War to around 1890; the decade or so between the end of World War I and the onset of the Great Depression; and the period from about 1950 to the early 1970s.",2004-07-07
"In these boom periods, average labor productivity growth ranged from 2-1/2 to 3-3/4 percent, about double the average of growth rates during other periods.",2004-07-07
The striking similarities of these three episodes provide clues about the types of economic policies and other factors that have been important in promoting sustained productivity gains.,2004-07-07
"The productivity boom after the Civil War resulted from a variety of technological advances, including the expansion of and improvements in the use of steam power, railroad transportation, and communication by telegraph.",2004-07-07
"In the productivity boom that followed World War I, a chief technological innovation was the spread of electrification to the factory floor.",2004-07-07

"For example, research advances in polymer chemistry, the development of new diesel and jet engine technologies, and the invention of the transistor and the integrated circuit facilitated productivity improvements in a wide range of industries and the creation of an array of highly useful consumer products.",2004-07-07
"In the productivity boom of the late nineteenth century, for example, the potential for economies of scale made possible by the new technologies led to dramatic increases in firm size in many industries.",2004-07-07
"From the early 1970s until 1995, productivity growth in the U.S. nonfarm business sector averaged about 1-1/2 percent per year--a disappointingly low figure relative both to historical U.S. experience and to the performance of other industrial economies over the same period.1 Between 1995 and 2001, however, the rate of productivity growth picked up significantly, to about 2-1/2 percent per year--a figure that contributed to a growing perception that the United States might be entering a new economic era.",2005-01-19
"Talk of the ""new economy"" faded with the sharp declines in the stock valuations of high-tech firms at the turn of the millennium; yet, remarkably, productivity growth continued to rise.",2005-01-19
"The pace of productivity gains averaged better than 4 percent per year since 2001 despite adverse developments that included the 2001 recession, the September 11 terrorist attacks, corporate governance scandals, and, most recently, a sharp rise in energy costs.",2005-01-19
Why is the rate of productivity growth so important?,2005-01-19
"Economists agree that, in the long run, productivity growth is the principal source of improvements in living standards.",2005-01-19
"The link between productivity growth and the standard of living of the average person is somewhat looser in the short-to-medium run, as factors such as the share of the population that is employed and the division of income between capital and labor also play a role.",2005-01-19
"Nevertheless, the rate of productivity growth influences the economy in important ways even in the short run, affecting key variables such as output growth, employment growth, and the rate of inflation.",2005-01-19
"In my remarks today, I will discuss the pickup in U.S. productivity growth and its implications for the economy.",2005-01-19

"With that background, I will next consider the near-term prospects for productivity growth.",2005-01-19
"Finally, I will discuss briefly how the evolving productivity picture affects both the economic outlook and the appropriate stance of monetary policy.",2005-01-19
Productivity Resurgence and Its Causes Why has productivity growth increased?,2005-01-19
The favored explanation of the rise in productivity growth since about 1995 has evolved somewhat over time.,2005-01-19
"By 2000 or so, an emerging consensus held that the pickup in productivity growth was, for the most part, the product of rapid technological progress and increased investment in new information and communication technologies (ICT) during the 1990s (Jorgenson and Stiroh, 2000; Oliner and Sichel, 2000).",2005-01-19
"According to this view, rapid developments in ICT promoted U.S. productivity growth in two ways.",2005-01-19
"First, technological advances allowed the ICT-producing sectors themselves to exhibit rapid productivity growth.",2005-01-19
Both the more-rapid pace of production and the higher average quality of output raised productivity at Intel and competing firms.,2005-01-19
"Second, ICT advances also promoted productivity growth outside the ICT-producing sector, as firms in a wide range of industries expanded their investments in high-tech equipment and software and used the new technologies to reduce costs and increase quality (McKinsey, 2001).",2005-01-19
"For example, some large retailers, most notably Walmart, developed ICT-based tools to improve the management of their supply chains and to increase their responsiveness to changes in the level and mix of customer demand.",2005-01-19
Securities brokers and dealers achieved substantial productivity gains by automating their trading processes and their back-office operations.,2005-01-19
"One study found that nearly two-thirds of U.S. industries, comprising about 70 percent of total employment, experienced an acceleration of productivity in the latter part of the 1990s.",2005-01-19
"Undoubtedly, the ICT revolution and the productivity resurgence in the United States after 1995 were closely connected, but several puzzles have arisen that challenge the view that ICT investment leads mechanically to higher productivity.",2005-01-19
"Yet, with a few exceptions, productivity growth in other advanced countries has not increased recently to the extent seen in the United States.",2005-01-19
"Throughout most of the post-World War II period, labor productivity growth in Europe exceeded that in the United States, reflecting, first, rapid gains during the postwar reconstruction and then a gradual convergence of European technology and business practices to American standards.",2005-01-19
"By one estimate, on average, European productivity increased from 44 percent of the U.S. level in 1950 to 94 percent in 1995 (Gordon, 2004).",2005-01-19
"However, since about 1995, productivity growth in Europe has slowed, in contrast to the U.S. experience, and productivity levels in the United States and Europe have begun to diverge.3 Researchers have made the important point that U.S.-European differences in productivity growth do not appear to have been particularly large in the ICT-producing sectors, where U.S. strengths in the development of information technologies have been offset by European leadership in communications.",2005-01-19
"Industry-specific regulations may also be an important barrier to productivity improvement; for example, some writers have argued that restrictions on land use and on shopping hours in Europe have impeded the development of ""big box"" retail outlets, denying European firms the economies of scale that have been important for productivity growth in the U.S. retail sector (Gordon, 2004).",2005-01-19
"Differences in regulatory burden do not appear to be a complete explanation of comparative productivity performance, however.",2005-01-19
"For example, the United Kingdom, whose approach to the regulation of labor and product markets is closer to that of the United States than to that of continental Europe, has not done noticeably better in the productivity arena than other advanced European countries (Basu, Fernald, Oulton, and Srinivasan, 2003).",2005-01-19
"Skill shortages may have also been a factor in continental Europe, possibly because high youth unemployment has reduced opportunities for workers to acquire new skills on the job.",2005-01-19
"Other suggested explanations for the relatively better productivity performance of the United States in recent years include the depth and flexibility of U.S. capital markets, its relatively open immigration policies (at least before 9/11), and the role of U.S. research universities in fostering innovation.",2005-01-19
"Further study of the productivity differentials among the United States, Europe, and other regions clearly is warranted.",2005-01-19
"A second puzzle that challenges the conclusion that advances in ICT are the primary source of recent productivity gains is the observation that, over the past twenty years or so, increases in ICT investment have not been followed reliably and in short order by increases in productivity growth.",2005-01-19
"Instead, the lag between investments in new technologies and their putative productivity benefits appears to be long and variable.",2005-01-19
"For example, ICT investment in the United States began in earnest in the 1980s, but productivity did not begin to accelerate until the mid-1990s.",2005-01-19
"Indeed, an oft-quoted quip by economist Robert Solow held that, as of the late 1980s, ""computers are everywhere except in the productivity statistics.",2005-01-19
"""4 Likewise, although ICT investment declined sharply after the meltdown in tech stocks in 2000, productivity growth has continued to rise in recent years, as I have already noted.",2005-01-19
Perhaps the link between investment in high-tech capital and improving productivity is not so tight as we thought.,2005-01-19
"In attempting to explain the relatively loose temporal link between ICT investment and productivity growth, economists have emphasized that much more than the purchase of new high-tech equipment is needed to achieve significant gains in productivity.",2005-01-19
"Case studies of individual industries show that, in some cases, the planning for technological modernization has not always been adequate, with the result that some purchases of high-tech equipment and software have not added much to productivity or profits.",2005-01-19
"Second, firms' need to invest in intangible capital--and thus to divert resources from the production of market goods or services--helps to explain why measured output and productivity may decline initially when firms introduce new technologies.",2005-01-19
"Finally, the importance of intangible investment explains to some degree why the lags between ICT investment and the resulting productivity gains can be long and variable.",2005-01-19
"Because investments in high-tech capital typically require complementary investments in intangible capital for productivity gains to be realized, the benefits of high-tech investment may become visible only after a period of time.",2005-01-19
"Medium-Term Prospects for Productivity Growth Historical analysis of the sources of the productivity acceleration is challenging, but not nearly so challenging as trying to predict how productivity will evolve over the next few years.",2005-01-19
"However, because the rate of productivity growth is a primary determinant of economic performance, policymakers have few options other than to try to forecast future productivity gains.",2005-01-19
What can be said about the medium-term prospects for productivity growth?,2005-01-19
The task of trying to predict the medium-term behavior of productivity is complicated by the fact that productivity growth tends to vary with the business cycle.,2005-01-19
"According to one popular hypothesis, this tendency reflects cyclical variations in the intensity with which labor is utilized.6 Because adjusting the size of a company's labor force may involve significant fixed costs (including training costs as well as costs of hiring and firing), employers are generally reluctant to add or subtract workers at the first sign of a change in the demand for their products.",2005-01-19
Measured productivity growth consequently declines when the economy enters a recession.,2005-01-19
"Finally, as the expansion matures and hiring picks up, productivity growth tends to slow again as the level of employee effort returns to normal and as the need to devote firm resources to hiring and training new workers detracts from current production.",2005-01-19
"At present, three years from the official end of the 2001 recession, the U.S. economy has likely entered this latter stage, as productivity growth appears to be falling from its recent high levels to a rate that is likely below its longer-term trend.",2005-01-19
"Cyclical factors tend to unwind, however; and so, looking ahead a couple of quarters, say, to the second half of 2005, we can reasonably assume that productivity growth will approach its secular trend.",2005-01-19
"Using various econometric methods, together with a liberal dose of judgment, several leading economists have recently offered estimates for secular productivity growth of about 2-1/2 percent per year, close to the rate of productivity growth achieved during 1995-2001 (Baily, 2003; Gordon, 2003; Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh, 2004).",2005-01-19
"If these estimates turn out to be correct--and they are certainly subject to a great deal of uncertainty, as I will discuss--then the increase in productivity growth of the mid-1990s may come to be seen as having initiated a new era for the U.S. economy.",2005-01-19
"Of course, as the saying goes, past returns are not a guarantee of future results; not all the evidence supports the emerging consensus that secular productivity growth will remain at its current elevated level.",2005-01-19
"For example, although spending on high-tech equipment and software has recovered smartly from its recent lows, growth in ICT spending still remains well below rates seen before the 2001 recession.",2005-01-19
"Some industry participants have suggested that less-rapid growth in ICT spending reflects the absence of major new business applications for ICT--""killer apps,""as they are called--and that ICT investment for the foreseeable future will largely reflect replacement demands.",2005-01-19
"Researchers have also found some evidence that the technological frontier may not have advanced as quickly recently as it did in earlier years; as one indicator, the price of computing power has recently declined more slowly than it did in the 1980s and 1990s.",2005-01-19
"These caveats notwithstanding, I think the productivity optimists have a good case.",2005-01-19
"Computing power may not be falling in price quite so rapidly now as in the late 1990s, but a dollar nevertheless buys a great deal more computational capacity today than it did even five years ago.",2005-01-19
"Moreover, even if the technological frontier advances more slowly during the next few years, further diffusion of the existing technologies and applications can continue to raise aggregate productivity.",2005-01-19
"As of 2000, the last year included in their study, the authors found this gap to be 40 percent and rising, suggesting that substantial opportunities remain for increasing productivity.",2005-01-19
"I draw two conclusions: First, on the whole, the relatively optimistic estimates of secular productivity growth espoused by leading scholars in the field do not seem unreasonable, so that, for the longer term, continued growth in productivity in the range of, say, 2 percent to 2-1/2 percent per year probably represents a good baseline assumption.",2005-01-19
"Second, qualifying the first conclusion, the range of uncertainty in forecasts of productivity growth is inevitably quite wide.",2005-01-19
"For example, a 2004 study by three leading scholars produced an estimate of trend productivity growth of 2.6 percent, but with a range of plausible outcomes between 1.4 percent and 3.2 percent (Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh, 2004).",2005-01-19
"This qualification naturally leads us to ask: Suppose that, over the next year, the incoming evidence suggests that the trend rate of productivity growth is either substantially higher or substantially lower than we currently expect.",2005-01-19
How would that development affect the economy and monetary policy?,2005-01-19
"Implications for the Economy and Monetary Policy For concreteness, suppose that the pace of productivity gains in the latter part of 2005 and in 2006 proves disappointing, sufficiently so to suggest that current estimates of the sustainable rate of productivity growth may be overoptimistic.",2005-01-19
"To anticipate the conclusion, we will see that the strength of the response of aggregate demand to productivity developments is the key determinant of their overall impact.7 In the first instance, incoming evidence of a secular slowdown in productivity would likely result in slower growth in consumption spending, capital investment, and aggregate output relative to what would have been otherwise expected.",2005-01-19
"Consumption growth would weaken as downwardly revised profit expectations limit stock market gains, thereby reducing household wealth, and as more-foresighted consumers perceive that smaller productivity gains portend lower real wage growth.",2005-01-19
Lower expected rates of productivity growth should also tend to moderate growth in business investment by reducing the prospective return to capital.,2005-01-19
"As consumption and investment spending make up more than four-fifths of aggregate output, slower productivity growth would perforce reduce output growth as well.",2005-01-19
What about inflation?,2005-01-19
"In principle, the medium-term effect of slowing productivity growth on inflation is ambiguous.",2005-01-19
"As a number of analysts have noted, under the reasonable assumption that nominal wages adjust slowly, slower productivity growth results in a more rapid rise in unit labor costs (the nominal-wage cost of producing a unit of output).8 All else equal, a more rapid increase in unit labor costs will tend to increase inflation as well.",2005-01-19
"However, the effect of higher unit labor costs may be offset if the decline in consumption and investment spending induced by the productivity slowdown is particularly sharp.",2005-01-19
"Indeed, a large deceleration in spending could conceivably cause inflation to slow following a productivity slowdown, as firms' markups contract more than unit labor costs rise.",2005-01-19
The effect of a productivity slowdown on employment growth is likewise ambiguous in the medium term.,2005-01-19
"Slower output growth depresses employment growth as firms face weaker demand, but slower productivity growth implies that firms need more workers to produce a given level of output.",2005-01-19
"As in the case of inflation, the strength of the spending response is crucial.",2005-01-19
"The more sharply spending and output decline following a productivity slowdown, the more adverse the effects on employment will be.",2005-01-19
"Both the late 1990s and the more recent period illustrate the central role of the spending response in determining the macroeconomic effects of a change in productivity growth, although (as I have discussed today) in both of these episodes the productivity surprise was to the upside rather than the downside.",2005-01-19
"The rise in productivity growth after 1995 was accompanied by surges in both consumption and investment spending, supported by a booming stock market.",2005-01-19
"Employment rose and unemployment fell, as the strength of aggregate demand induced employers to hire, the increases in productivity notwithstanding.",2005-01-19
"Inflation remained fairly stable during this period, as upward pressures from increased aggregate demand were balanced by downward pressures on unit labor costs (for any given level of wages) and by the increase in aggregate supply created by higher productivity.",2005-01-19
"In contrast to the experience of the late 1990s, during the early part of the new millennium the response of spending to rising productivity growth was comparatively weak.",2005-01-19
"Investment spending was particularly slow to respond to the further increase in productivity growth, for reasons that are still debated.",2005-01-19
"An explanation suggested by my discussion today is that, for most of this period, companies were enjoying the fruits--in terms of higher productivity--of earlier investments in both tangible and intangible capital.",2005-01-19
"Whatever the cause, the weaker response of spending in the more-recent period, coupled with impressive gains in productivity, helped to generate both a pattern of slow job growth (the ""jobless recovery"") and the worrisome decline in inflation in 2003.",2005-01-19
What are the implications of these observations for current monetary policy?,2005-01-19
"Certainly, monetary policy makers should pay close attention to developments on the productivity front, as the effects of changing productivity trends permeate the economy.",2005-01-19
"However, as we have seen, the appropriate policy response to any perceived change in the trend rate of productivity growth will depend to a significant degree on the response of private-sector spending.",2005-01-19
"For example, if productivity growth appears poised to decelerate, but (for whatever reason) aggregate private spending does not slow materially in response, then inflation risks would rise, but employment would not be adversely affected.",2005-01-19
The appropriate response in this case would be a tightening of monetary policy (or a more rapid removal of accommodation).,2005-01-19
"On the other hand, if slower productivity growth were accompanied by a sufficiently large slowdown in aggregate demand and economic activity, then easier monetary policy (or a slower removal of policy accommodation) might be called for.",2005-01-19
"My best guess--and it is only a guess--is that future responses of consumption and investment spending to changes in the pace of productivity growth are likely to be less powerful than those of the late 1990s, if for no other reason than that we may have learned to be more careful in our enthusiasms.",2005-01-19
"If so, then the principal effect of an unexpected slowdown in productivity growth during the next few years would likely be higher inflation, with the short-term impact on the growth of output and employment likely to be relatively minor.",2005-01-19
"In this scenario, the appropriate monetary policy response would be toward less accommodation.",2005-01-19
"By similar reasoning, if productivity growth were to accelerate in the next few years, then easing inflation pressures and slowing employment growth would likely allow for less-restrictive policies.",2005-01-19
"As I have emphasized, however, these conclusions depend on other developments in the economy, most importantly on how strongly aggregate spending responds to any perceived change in secular productivity growth.",2005-01-19
"Notably, imperfect data and the difficulties of distinguishing permanent from temporary changes will make changes in secular productivity growth exceptionally difficult to identify in real time, both for the private sector and for the Federal Reserve.",2005-01-19
The need to discern the underlying economic forces and to react appropriately in an environment of incomplete information makes monetary policy an exceptionally challenging endeavor.,2005-01-19
"I will use ""labor productivity"" and ""productivity"" interchangeably in my remarks today.",2005-01-19
"An alternative productivity concept, multifactor productivity, measures the quantity of output that can be produced by a fixed combination of capital and labor.",2005-01-19
Changes in labor productivity generally reflect changes in both multifactor productivity and the amount of capital per worker.,2005-01-19
Correcting for national differences in productivity measurement in some cases reduces the apparent differential in recent productivity growth but does not eliminate it.,2005-01-19

"November 19, 2021 Perspectives on Global Monetary Policy Coordination, Cooperation, and Correlation Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the ""Macroeconomic Policy and Global Economic Recovery"" 2021 Asia Economic Policy Conference, sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Center for Pacific Basin Studies, San Francisco, California (via webcast) Share Watch Live In my remarks today, I would like to offer some perspectives on global monetary policy correlation and what it canâ€”and cannotâ€”reveal about the prevalence and value of global monetary policy coordination or, in the limit, binding global monetary cooperation.1 In both the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the Global Pandemic Collapse (GPC), major central banks around the world responded by cutting policy rates to, and then keeping them at, their effective lower bounds (ELBs); by increasing their balance sheets through ambitious and expansive large-scale asset purchase and lending programs; and by offering forward guidanceâ€”both Delphic and Odysseanâ€”on the stance of their future monetary policies.2 As these examples make clear, we certainly do observe that national monetary policies are often correlated, and such examples are not confined to recent experience.",2021-11-19
"Indeed, the international monetary economics literature abounds with historical and empirical studies of correlated global monetary policy cycles, not to mention the evident secular downtrend in global monetary policy rates observed in recent decades.",2021-11-19
"To begin with the theory, it has long been appreciated that in the sorts of economic models used by central banks around the world, the calibrated gains to international monetary policy cooperation are found to be rather modest relative to a status quo ante in which each country runs a sensible policy, taking as given the sensible policies of the other countries.",2021-11-19
"Today I will make a somewhat different, and less often discussed, case questioning formal global monetary policy cooperationâ€”that, in practice, adopting it could plausibly erode central bank credibility and public support for central bank instrument independence.",2021-11-19
"International monetary policy coordination, which I think of as including the sharing of information and analysis among central banks regarding the evolution of their individual economies as well as the considerations that govern the setting of their policy instrumentsâ€”in other words, information about their policy reaction functions can, and in my observation certainly does, enhance the design and effectiveness of monetary policy execution for each country.",2021-11-19
"But while international monetary policy coordination may enhance the efficiency of monetary policy execution, I am skeptical that in practice there are additional material, reliable, and robust gains that would flow from a formal regime of binding monetary policy cooperation, at least among major G-7 economies with flexible exchange rates, open capital accounts, and central bank mandates that include price stability.",2021-11-19
"In such a regime, national monetary policies in each country would be constrained to be set in such a way so as to jointly maximize some metric for global price stability and perhaps also other objectives.",2021-11-19
The reason is that there can be global externalities to monetary policy that create such theoretical gains to cooperation.,2021-11-19
"However, as Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2002), among others, have shown in the context of central banks with domestic price-stability mandates, to achieve the theoretical gains to international monetary policy cooperation, policy in each country must be set with reference to an index of inflation in all countries party to the cooperative agreement.",2021-11-19
"This is a policy that no central bank would choose were it not bound to the agreement to achieve domestic price stability while taking other central banks' policies as given, which, of course, raises the question of how such an agreement might be enforced.",2021-11-19
"But in practice, no sovereign central bank outsources its policy to an Excel spreadsheet, and, moreover, best-practice policy rules incorporate inputsâ€”such as the neutral rate of interest or expected inflationâ€”that are unobserved and time varying and thus difficult to monitor.",2021-11-19
"For example, the Federal Reserve is mandated to pursue policies that achieve ""maximum employment and price stability.""",2021-11-19
"The European Central Bank (ECB) is mandated by treaty to pursue price stability but also has a secondary mandate to contribute to achieving the objectives of the European Union, which include balanced economic growth and full employment.",2021-11-19
"Similarly, the Bank of England's primary objective is to achieve the U.K. government's target of 2 percent inflation, but its secondary objective is to support the government's policy aims, including those for employment, growth, andâ€”more recentlyâ€”environmental sustainability.",2021-11-19
"So even though all major central banks are mandated to achieve ""price stability"" in some form or fashion, their mandates typically include other obligations that vary across jurisdictions.",2021-11-19
"Because these obligations can, and sometimes do, require central banks to make a tradeoffâ€”for example, in the United States, between inflation and employment in the presence of supply shocksâ€”defining the objective that a cooperative agreement would choose to maximize would be a formidable task.",2021-11-19
"Simply stated and in the context of a price-stability mandate for each central bank, the problemâ€”as I see itâ€”is the threat to the credibility of the central bank, the challenges to central bank communication, and the resulting potential loss of support for its policy actions from the public when the policy choices that would be required by binding monetary policy cooperation react not only to home inflation deviations from target, but also to deviations of foreign inflation from target.",2021-11-19
"In theoretical models, the commitment to the inflation target is just assumed to be perfect and credible, but in practice, credibility appears to be a function of central bank communication and of the policies actually implemented pushing inflation towardâ€”and, in the absence of shocks, keeping inflation atâ€”target.",2021-11-19
"I suspect that, in practice, central banks would have a hard time maintaining credibility and independence as well as communicating a policy that raised home interest rates aggressively not because home inflation is too high but because foreign inflation is!",2021-11-19
"While, perhaps for these reasons, we do not have many confirmed sightings of genuine binding monetary policy cooperation, we do observe many examples of monetary policy correlation (see figure 1).",2021-11-19
"In the ""home"" country, the optimal inflation-targeting monetary policy can be written as a Taylor-type rule: $$ R_{t} = r_{t} + (1 + \frac{\lambda}{\alpha})\pi_{t}, $$ where $$r_t$$ is the ""neutral"" interest rate in the home country consistent with price stability and trend growth and $$\pi_t$$ is inflation in the home country.",2021-11-19
The ratio $$\lambda/\alpha$$ captures the extent to which the home central bank trades off its inflation and gross domestic product (GDP) objectives when they are in conflict.,2021-11-19
The parameter $$\alpha$$ indexes the priority the central bank places on stabilizing GDP growth relative to its trend path.,2021-11-19
"When $$\alpha$$ is large, the central bank leans against high inflation less aggressively than it would were $$\alpha$$ small.",2021-11-19
"With an integrated global capital market, the neutral policy rate at home is a function of trend GDP growth at home as well as expected foreign GDP growth: $$ r_{t} = 2E_{t}\{\Delta \bar{y}_{t+1}\} + E_{t}\{\Delta y^{*}_{t+1}\}.",2021-11-19
"$$ Now, to the extent the foreign central bank has a comparative advantage in tracking or forecasting foreign output growthâ€”which, of course, it should, since such growth will depend on the foreign central bank's monetary policyâ€”sharing this information with the home central bank can improve that institution's estimate of the home equilibrium real interest rate and thus the effectiveness of its policy rule in meeting its domestic objectives.",2021-11-19
"$$ The ratio $$\lambda/\alpha^{*}$$ captures the extent to which the foreign central bank trades off its inflation and GDP objectives when they are in conflict, and note that this tradeoff may be different than that of the home central bank.",2021-11-19
"For example, even if home and foreign inflation rates and trend growth rates are uncorrelated across countries, sensible monetary policies can be correlated across countries if neutral policy rates are correlated, as they appear to be in the data (see figure 2, which is based on Holston, Laubach, and Williams, 2017).",2021-11-19
"A recent working paper, Ferreira and Shousha (2021), models the determinants of the neutral policy rate in the United States and includes in the empirical specification an index of global productivity growth and demographic trends.",2021-11-19
Their empirical estimates attribute 85 basis points of the decline in U.S. neutral real interest rates since 2000 to global spillovers from the slowdown in global trend growth and demographic trends.,2021-11-19
"So policy correlation can be an outcome of noncooperative monetary policy operating in an integrated global capital market and not evidence, in and of itself, of policy coordination, let alone cooperation.",2021-11-19
"Before continuing, I consider briefly how monetary policy would differ under binding cooperation in the simple example sketched out earlier.",2021-11-19
"Under international monetary policy cooperation, the policy rate is set according to $$ R_{t} = r_{t} + (1 + \frac{\lambda}{\alpha})\pi_{t} + \frac{1}{3}(1+\frac{\lambda}{\alpha})\pi^{*}_{t}.",2021-11-19
"$$ So, intuitively, while policy in the home country does place more weight on home inflation when setting the interest rate, it also reacts to foreign inflation as well, as I discussed earlier.",2021-11-19
Consider the case with home inflation high and foreign inflation low.,2021-11-19
"As can be seen from the preceding equation, the optimal policy under cooperation calls for the home interest rate to be lowerâ€”more accommodativeâ€”than it would be in the absence of cooperation.",2021-11-19
"In practice, the home central bank's credibility as an inflation targeter to satisfy its domestic price-stability mandate might well suffer if it failed to respond aggressively to high domestic inflation because of, say, serious deflation abroad.",2021-11-19
"Monetary Policy Spillovers Flow in Both Directions There is a vast literature that documents the existence of international spillovers from U.S. monetary policy, especially to emerging markets (EMs).",2021-11-19
"Recent researchâ€”Hoek, Kamin, and Yoldas (2020)â€”suggests that the extent and consequences of such spillovers depend importantly on the source of a shift in U.S. monetary policy.",2021-11-19
"Their key finding, illustrated in figure 3, is that Federal Reserve policy rate surprises attributed to stronger U.S. growth generally have only moderate spillovers to EM financial conditions, whereas U.S. policy rate changes attributed to U.S. inflationary pressures trigger more substantial spillovers to EM financial conditions.",2021-11-19
"The authors also find compelling evidence that the magnitude of the cross-border spillovers attributed to U.S. monetary policy shifts depends on a country's macroeconomic vulnerabilityâ€”as measured by inflation, current account deficit, international reserves, government debt, external debt, and private-sector credit growth, with more vulnerable EM countries experiencing larger spillovers from U.S. monetary policy.",2021-11-19
"While I will certainly acknowledge that both fundamental and financial shocks originating in the United States, including shifts in the direction of U.S. monetary policy, can and do propagate globally (see, for example, Miranda-Agrippino and Rey, forthcoming), the evidence suggests that causality can and does run in both directions.",2021-11-19
It is not difficult to recall external events that have triggered spillovers from foreign sovereign markets to the U.S. economy that have had observable implications for U.S. monetary policy.,2021-11-19
The Mexican peso crisis of 1994â€“95 and the Asian financial crisis of 1997â€“98 resulted in substantial declines in economic activity in emerging markets but had only a modest effect on the U.S. economy.,2021-11-19
"In more recent times, global shocks have also been consequential for U.S. economic prospects and monetary policy.",2021-11-19
"But despite the drop in Treasury yields, overall financial conditions in the United States tightened, weighing on aggregate demand.",2021-11-19
"U.S. monetary policy responded to these global ""headwinds,"" helping stave off actual contractions of U.S. activity.",2021-11-19
"During the 2011â€“13 euro-zone crisis, the Federal Reserve was already pursuing very accommodative policies in the wake of the GFC, but the introduction of the maturity extension program in September 2011 and the announcement in September 2012 of the third installment of quantitative easing were in part aimed at offsetting the effect of these global headwinds on U.S. aggregate demand.",2021-11-19
The Federal Reserve and ECB Framework Reviews The monetary policy framework reviews conducted by the Federal Reserve and the ECB provide another example of monetary policy correlation.,2021-11-19
"In February 2019, the Federal Reserve System launched a review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices.",2021-11-19
"A key motivation for the Fed's review as well as the ECB's review was the substantial decline in estimates of the neutral real interest rate, r*, that, over the longer run, is consistent with price stability.",2021-11-19
"This decline has critical implications for monetary policy because it leaves central banks with less conventional policy space to offset adverse shocks to aggregate demand.5 As discussed in Clarida (2020), the Fed's review, from the outset, built on three pillars: a series of Fed Listens events, a flagship research conference, and a series of rigorous briefings for the Committee commencing in July 2019 and running through January 2020.6 While our plans to conclude the review earlier in 2020 were, like so many things, delayed by the arrival of the pandemic, in August 2020, the Federal Reserve did announce, with unanimous support, an evolution of its monetary policy strategy to flexible average inflation targeting.7 Similar to the Federal Reserve, the ECB launched a review of its monetary policy strategy in January 2020.8 Since the time of its previous strategy review in 2003, like the Fed, the ECB observed profound structural changes in the global and euro-area economies that have driven down neutral interest rates and increased the incidence and duration of episodes in which nominal policy interest rates are close to the ELB.",2021-11-19
So the ECB's review sought to adapt its monetary policy to the current economic environment and to ensure that its policy could remain effective at the ELB.,2021-11-19
"In July 2021, with unanimous support from its Governing Council, the ECB announced its new strategy.10 Key elements of that strategy are a symmetric 2 percent inflation target, a view that the ELB requires especially forceful or persistent monetary policy measures to keep inflation expectations from drifting lower, and the affirmation that the full range of measures it has used in recent years will remain in its toolkit.",2021-11-19
The similarities in the two framework evolutions are due to the fact that powerful common global forces are driving down neutral policy rates and limiting the effectiveness of monetary policy in downturns to offset declines in aggregate demand.,2021-11-19
"This asymmetry of policy effectiveness caused by the ELB imparts a secular downward bias to inflation that, if not offset, could de-anchor inflation expectations below the central bank's price-stability objectives.",2021-11-19
"Conclusion In this speech, I have offered some perspectives on global monetary policy correlation and what it canâ€”and cannotâ€”reveal about the prevalence and value of global monetary policy coordination or, in the limit, binding global monetary cooperation.",2021-11-19
"I have argued that, while there are several recent and historical examples where we certainly do observe that national monetary policies are often correlated, adopting formal global monetary policy cooperation could plausibly erode central bank credibility and public support for central bank independence.",2021-11-19
"However, the effects of our policy instruments, such as the short-term interest rate, on these goal variables are indirect at best.",2003-10-02
"Instead, monetary policy actions have their most direct and immediate effects on the broader financial markets, including the stock market, government and corporate bond markets, mortgage markets, markets for consumer credit, foreign exchange markets, and many others.",2003-10-02
"If all goes as planned, the changes in financial asset prices and returns induced by the actions of monetary policymakers lead to the changes in economic behavior that the policy was trying to achieve.",2003-10-02
"Thus, understanding how monetary policy affects the broader economy necessarily entails understanding both how policy actions affect key financial markets, as well as how changes in asset prices and returns in these markets in turn affect the behavior of households, firms, and other decisionmakers.",2003-10-02
The link between monetary policy and the stock market is of particular interest.,2003-10-02
Stock prices are among the most closely watched asset prices in the economy and are viewed as being highly sensitive to economic conditions.,2003-10-02
"Stock prices have also been known to swing rather widely, leading to concerns about possible ""bubbles"" or other deviations of stock prices from fundamental values that may have adverse implications for the economy.",2003-10-02
"It is of great interest, then, to understand more precisely how monetary policy and the stock market are related.",2003-10-02
"First, by how much do changes in monetary policy affect equity prices?",2003-10-02
"As you will see, we focus on changes in monetary policy that are unanticipated by market participants because anticipated changes in policy should already be discounted by stock market investors and, hence, are unlikely to affect equity prices at the time they are announced.",2003-10-02
"We find an effect of moderate size: Monetary policy matters for the stock market but, on the other hand, it is not one of the major influences on equity prices.",2003-10-02
"Our second question, both more interesting and more difficult, is, why do changes in monetary policy affect stock prices?",2003-10-02
"We find that unanticipated changes in monetary policy affect stock prices not so much by influencing expected dividends or the risk-free real interest rate, but rather by affecting the perceived riskiness of stocks.",2003-10-02
"A tightening of monetary policy, for example, leads investors to view stocks as riskier investments and thus to demand a higher return to hold stocks.",2003-10-02
"For a given path of expected dividends, a higher expected return can be achieved only by a fall in the current stock price.",2003-10-02
"As we will see, this finding has interesting implications for several issues, including the role of stock prices in transmitting the effects of monetary policy actions to the broader economy and the potential effectiveness of monetary policy in ""pricking"" putative bubbles in the stock market.",2003-10-02
"I start, however, with the problem of measuring the effect of monetary policy on the stock market.",2003-10-02
"The Effect of Monetary Policy Actions on the Stock Market Normally, the FOMC, the monetary policymaking arm of the Federal Reserve, announces its interest rate decisions at around 2:15 p.m. following each of its eight regularly scheduled meetings each year.",2003-10-02
"Then the black line representing each market index moves quickly up or down, and the markets have priced the FOMC action into the aggregate values of U.S. equities, bonds, and other assets.",2003-10-02
"On occasion, if economic conditions warrant, the FOMC may decide to make a change in monetary policy on a day that falls between regularly scheduled meetings, a so-called intermeeting move.",2003-10-02
"Intermeeting moves, typically agreed upon during a conference call of the Committee, nearly always take financial markets by surprise, at least in their precise timing, and they are often followed by dramatic swings in asset prices.",2003-10-02
"Even the casual observer can have no doubt, then, that FOMC decisions move asset prices, including equity prices.",2003-10-02
"Because traders in equity markets, as in most other financial markets, are generally highly informed and sophisticated, any policy decision that is largely anticipated will already be factored into stock prices and will elicit little reaction when announced.",2003-10-02
"To measure the effects of monetary policy changes on the stock market, then, we need to have a measure of the portion of a given change in monetary policy that the market had not already anticipated before the FOMC's formal announcement.",2003-10-02
"Fortunately, the financial markets themselves are a source of useful information about monetary policy expectations.",2003-10-02
"As you may know, the FOMC implements its decisions about monetary policy by changing its target for a particular short-term interest rate, the federal funds rate.",2003-10-02
"The existence of a market in federal funds futures is a boon not only to investors, such as banks, which want to protect themselves against changes in the cost of reserves, but also to both policymakers and researchers, because it allows any observer to infer from the sale prices of futures contracts the values of the federal funds rate that market participants anticipate at various future dates.2 Previous research (Krueger and Kuttner, 1996; Owens and Webb, 2001) has shown that participants in this market collectively do a good job of forecasting future values of the funds rate, efficiently incorporating available information about likely future monetary policy actions.3 By using data from the federal funds futures market, then, it is possible to estimate the value at which financial market participants expect the FOMC to set its target for the federal funds rate on any given date.",2003-10-02
"By comparing this expected value to what the FOMC actually did at each date, we can determine the portion of the Fed's interest rate decision that came as a surprise to financial markets.",2003-10-02
"However, this cut in the federal funds rate was not entirely unexpected; indeed, according to the federal funds futures market, investors were expecting a cut of about 31 basis points, on average, from the Fed at that meeting.6 So, of the 50 basis points that the FOMC lowered its target for the federal funds rate last November 6, only 19 basis points were a surprise to financial markets and thus should have been expected to affect asset prices.",2003-10-02
"Note, by the way, that if the Fed had not changed interest rates at all that day, our method would have treated that action as the equivalent of a surprise tightening of policy of 31 basis points because the Fed would have done nothing while the market was expecting an easing of 31 basis points.",2003-10-02
"To evaluate the effect of monetary policy on the stock market, we looked at how broad measures of stock prices moved on days on which the Fed made unanticipated changes to policy.",2003-10-02
"On that day, the broad stock market index we used in our study (the value-weighted index constructed by the Center for Research in Securities Prices at the University of Chicago) rose in value by 0.96 percentage point.",2003-10-02
"Dividing the 96-basis-point gain in the stock market by the 19-basis-point downward surprise in the funds rate, we obtain a value of approximately 5 for the ""stock price multiplier"" relating policy changes to stock market changes.",2003-10-02
"In fact, applying a formal regression analysis to the full sample from 1989 to 2002, we found a number fairly close to this one, namely, a stock price multiplier for monetary policy of about 4.7.",2003-10-02
"We also found, as expected, that changes in monetary policy that were anticipated by the market had small and statistically unimportant effects on stock prices, presumably because these changes had already been priced into stocks.7 Although a stock price multiplier of about five for unanticipated changes in the federal funds rate is certainly not negligible, we should appreciate that unexpected changes in monetary policy account for a tiny portion of the overall variability of the stock market.",2003-10-02
"Yet the change of one percent or so in the stock market induced by the typical 20-basis-point ""surprise"" in the funds rate is swamped by the overall variability of stock prices.",2003-10-02
"Thus, news about monetary policy contributes very little to the day-to-day fluctuations in stock prices.",2003-10-02
"We noted, for example, that a few of the monetary policy changes in our sample were followed by what seemed to be excessive or otherwise unusual stock market responses.",2003-10-02
"This more conservative analysis led to a smaller estimate of the effect of policy actions on the stock market, a stock price multiplier of about 2.6 rather than 4.7.",2003-10-02
"For example, we investigated whether the magnitude of the effect on the stock market of a surprise policy tightening (that is, an increase in interest rates) differs from that of a surprise easing of comparable size.",2003-10-02
"The stock market multiplier associated with unanticipated policy moves that are perceived to be more permanent is a bit higher, as would be expected; its value is about 6.9 In short, the statistical evidence is strong for a stock price multiplier of monetary policy of something between 3 and 6, the higher values corresponding to policy changes that investors perceive to be relatively more permanent.",2003-10-02
"Incidentally, similar results obtain for stock values of industry groups: We find almost all industry stock portfolios respond significantly to changes in monetary policy, with telecommunications, high-tech, and durables goods industry stocks being the most sensitive to monetary policy news, and energy, utilities, and health care stocks being the least sensitive.10 These results can be broadly explained by the tendency of each industry group to move with the broad market, or (to use the language of the standard capital asset pricing theory), by their industry ""betas.""",2003-10-02
Why Does Monetary Policy Affect Stock Prices?,2003-10-02
"It is interesting, though perhaps not terribly surprising, to know that Federal Reserve policy actions affect stock prices.",2003-10-02
"Answering this question will give us some insight into how monetary policy affects the economy, as well as the role that the stock market should play in policy decisions.",2003-10-02
Then only two types of news ought to affect current stock values: news that affects investor forecasts of current or future (after-tax) dividends or news that affects forecasts of current or future short-term interest rates.,2003-10-02
"News that current or future dividends (which I want to think of here as being measured in real, or inflation-adjusted, terms) are likely to be higher than previously expected--say, because the company is expecting to be more profitable--should raise the current stock price.",2003-10-02
"News that current or future short-term interest rates (also measured in real, or inflation-adjusted, terms) are likely to be higher than previously expected should depress the stock price.",2003-10-02
There are two essentially equivalent ways of understanding why expectations of higher short-term real interest rates should lower stock prices.,2003-10-02
"First, to value future dividends, an investor must discount them back to the present; as higher interest rates make a given future dividend less valuable in today's dollars, higher interest rates reduce the value of a share of stock.",2003-10-02
"Second, higher real interest rates make investments other than stocks, such as bonds, more attractive, raising the required return on stocks and reducing what investors are willing to pay for them.",2003-10-02
"Under either interpretation, expectations of higher real interest rates are bad news for stocks.",2003-10-02
"So, to reiterate, in a world in which investors do not care about risk, stock prices should change only with news about current or future dividends or about current or future real interest rates.",2003-10-02
"Because investors care about risk, and because stocks are viewed as relatively risky investments, investors generally demand a higher average return, relative to other assets perceived to be safer, to hold stocks.",2003-10-02
"This extra return, known as the risk premium on stocks, or the equity premium, presumably reflects, in part, the extra compensation that investors demand to be willing to hold relatively more risky stocks.",2003-10-02
"11 Like news about dividends and real interest rates, news that affects the risk premium on stocks also affects stock prices.",2003-10-02
"For both reasons, the extra return that investors demand to hold stocks is likely to rise when bad times loom.",2003-10-02
"With expected dividends and the real interest rate on alternative assets held constant, the expected yield on stocks can rise only through a decline in the current stock price.12 We now have a list of three key factors that should affect stock prices.",2003-10-02
"First, news that current or future dividends will be higher should raise stock prices.",2003-10-02
"Second, news that current or future real short-term interest rates will be higher should lower stock prices.",2003-10-02
"And third, news that leads investors to demand a higher risk premium on stocks should lower stock prices.",2003-10-02
How does all this relate to the effects of monetary policy on stock prices?,2003-10-02
"According to our analysis, Fed actions should affect stock prices only to the extent that they affect investor expectations about dividends, short-term real interest rates, or the riskiness of stocks.",2003-10-02
"Imagine that the expectations of stock market investors can be mimicked by a statistical forecasting model that takes relevant current data as inputs and projects estimated future values of aggregate dividends, real interest rates, and equity risk premiums as outputs.",2003-10-02
"Besides a number of standard variables that have been shown to be helpful in making forecasts of such financial variables, suppose we include in the forecasting model our measure of unanticipated changes in the federal funds rate.13 That is, we use the information contained in these unanticipated changes in making our forecasts of future dividends, interest rates, and risk premiums.",2003-10-02
"Based on our forecasting model, by how much would that information change our previous forecasts of future dividends, interest rates, and risk premiums?",2003-10-02
The answer to this question clarifies the channel by which monetary policy affects stock prices.,2003-10-02
"If we were to find, for example, that the news of an unexpected increase in the funds rate significantly changed the forecast of future dividends but did not much affect the forecasts of interest rates or risk premiums, then we could conclude that monetary policy affects stock prices primarily by affecting investor expectations of future dividends.",2003-10-02
"By contrast, if news of the policy action changed the model forecasts for real interest rates but did not change our forecasts for the other two variables, we would decide that unanticipated policy actions affect stock prices primarily by influencing the interest rates expected by stock investors.",2003-10-02
"It appears that, for example, an unanticipated tightening of monetary policy leads to only a modest change in forecasts of future dividends and to still less of a change in forecasts of future real interest rates (beyond a few quarters).",2003-10-02
"Specifically, an unanticipated tightening of monetary policy raises expected risk premiums on stocks for a protracted period.",2003-10-02
"For a given expected stream of dividend payouts and real interest rates, the risk premium and hence the return to holding stocks can only rise if the current stock price falls.",2003-10-02
"In short, our analysis suggests that an unanticipated monetary tightening lowers stock prices only to a small extent by lowering investor expectations about future dividend payouts, and by still less by raising expected real interest rates.",2003-10-02
Reduced willingness of investors to hold relatively more risky stocks drives down stock prices.,2003-10-02
"Our analysis does not explain precisely how monetary policy affects risk, but we can make reasonable conjectures.",2003-10-02
"For example, tighter monetary policy may raise the riskiness of shares themselves by raising the interest costs and weakening the balance sheets of publicly owned firms (Bernanke and Gertler, 1995).",2003-10-02
"In the macroeconomy more generally, by reducing spending and economic activity, tighter money raises the risks of unemployment or bankruptcy faced by individual households or firms.",2003-10-02
"In each case, tighter monetary policy increases risk by reducing financial buffers or otherwise increasing the vulnerability of individuals or firms to future shocks to the economy.",2003-10-02
"Implications of the Results for Monetary Policy So far I have discussed two principal conclusions from the empirical analysis: First, the stock price multiplier of monetary policy is between 3 and 6--in other words, an unexpected change in the federal funds rate of 25 basis points leads, on average, to a movement of stock prices in the opposite direction of between 3/4 percentage point and 1-1/2 percentage points.",2003-10-02
"Second, the main reason that unanticipated changes in monetary policy affect stock prices is that they affect the risk premium on stocks.",2003-10-02
"In particular, a surprise tightening of policy raises the risk premium, lowering current stock prices, and a surprise easing lowers the risk premium, raising current stock prices.",2003-10-02
What implications do these results have for our broader understanding and for the practice of monetary policy?,2003-10-02
"I will briefly discuss two issues: first, the role of the stock market in the transmission of monetary policy changes to the economy; and second, the efficacy of monetary policy as a tool for controlling stock market ""bubbles.""",2003-10-02
A long-held element of the conventional wisdom is that the stock market is an important part of the transmission mechanism for monetary policy.,2003-10-02
"The logic goes as follows: Easier monetary policy, for example, raises stock prices.",2003-10-02
"Higher stock prices increase the wealth of households, prompting consumers to spend more--a result known as the wealth effect.",2003-10-02
"Moreover, high stock prices effectively reduce the cost of capital for firms, stimulating increased capital investment.",2003-10-02
"It is true, as I have discussed, that an easier monetary policy raises stock prices, whereas a tighter policy lowers them.",2003-10-02
"However, easier monetary policy not only raises stock prices; as we have seen, it also lowers risk premiums, presumably reflecting both a reduction in economic and financial volatility and an increase in the capacity of financial investors to bear risk.",2003-10-02
"Thus, our results suggest that easier monetary policy not only allows consumers to enjoy a capital gain in their stock portfolios today, but it also reduces the effective amount of economic and financial risk they must face.",2003-10-02
"Thus, the reduction in risk associated with an easing of monetary policy and the resulting reduction in precautionary saving may amplify the short-run impact of policy operating through the traditional channel based on increased asset values.",2003-10-02
"Likewise, reduced risk and volatility may provide an extra kick to capital expenditure in the short run, as firms are more likely to undertake investments in new structures or equipment in a more stable macroeconomic environment.14 A second issue concerns the role of monetary policy in the management of large swings in stock values, or ""bubbles.""",2003-10-02
"In an earlier speech (Bernanke, 2002), I gave a number of reasons why I believe that using monetary policy--as opposed to microeconomic, prudential policies--is not a good way to address the problem of asset-market bubbles.",2003-10-02
"A major concern that I have about the bubble-popping strategy, however, is that attempts to bring down stock prices by a significant amount using monetary policy are likely to have highly deleterious and unwanted side effects on the broader economy.",2003-10-02
"First, this research suggests that relatively small changes in monetary policy would not do much to curb a major overvaluation in the stock market.",2003-10-02
"As we have seen, a surprise tightening of 25 basis points should be expected to lower stock prices by only a little more than 1 percent, which, as already noted, is a trivial movement relative to the overall variability of the stock market.",2003-10-02
"It would not be appropriate to extrapolate these results to try to estimate how much tightening would be needed to correct a substantial putative overvaluation in stock prices, but it seems clear that a light tapping of the brakes will not be sufficient.",2003-10-02
"What we can say is that the necessary policy move would have to be quite large--many percentage points on the federal funds rate--and we would be highly uncertain about its magnitude or its ultimate effects on stock prices and the economy.15,16 Second, we have seen that monetary tightening reduces stock prices primarily by increasing the risk premium for holding stocks, as opposed to raising the real interest rate or lowering expected dividends.",2003-10-02
"This evidence supports the proposition that monetary policy can lower stock values only to the extent that it weakens the broader economy, and in particular that it makes households considerably worse off.",2003-10-02
"Indeed, according to our analysis, policy would have to weaken the general economy quite significantly to obtain a large decline in stock prices.",2003-10-02
The observation that asset prices influence macroeconomic performance is hardly new.,2001-11-30
Undergraduate macroeconomic textbooks generally teach that increases in wealth should boost household spending and that increases in stock prices should stimulate business investment.,2001-11-30
"First, I will discuss the available empirical evidence from the United States on the effect of changes in asset prices on household consumption and business investment.",2001-11-30
"Second, I will highlight a few aspects of the relationship between asset prices and household spending that I believe merit further research.",2001-11-30
"Third, I will review how monetary policy has responded to asset price fluctuations among other elements of the economic environment in the United States during the past few years.",2001-11-30
"Empirical Evidence on Asset Prices and Spending At the aggregate level, a wealth effect on consumption has been a mainstay of large-scale econometric models for at least thirty years.",2001-11-30
"Personal saving--which is measured in the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts as the difference between disposable income and outlays--dropped from 6-1/2 percent of disposable income at the end of 1994 to roughly 1 percent in early 2000, when equity prices peaked.",2001-11-30
The magnitude of this decline is consistent with the runup in equity prices and the marginal propensity to consume out of equity wealth that appears in the Fed’s model.,2001-11-30
"For example, one study that analyzed the response of individual households to changes in stock market wealth found that, over the 1983-to-1999 period, the spending of U.S. households that own stocks responded to movements in the stock market, whereas the spending of non-holders of stocks has no apparent link to stock prices.1 A second study has estimated that, in the second half of the 1990s, households in the top of the income and education distributions in the United States showed the largest consumption increases, consistent with the fact that these households owned the most stocks and experienced the largest gains in wealth.2 Unfortunately, microeconomic evidence on the link between housing wealth and consumption is much more limited.",2001-11-30
But the substantial gains in housing wealth that have been experienced in recent years and the disparate movement of house and equity prices make this an issue of both policy and academic interest.,2001-11-30
"To be sure, not every analysis of the link between stock prices and spending comes to the same conclusions as those of the studies I mentioned.",2001-11-30
"When we turn to business spending, the evidence in support of a direct causal link from equity prices to business investment is weaker.",2001-11-30
"Indeed, neither Tobin’s q nor other approaches to formalizing the effect of equity prices on business investment have fared well in most empirical tests.",2001-11-30
Other influences on business investment aside from asset-price fluctuations--such as the acceleration in business output and the cash flow of firms--often have proven more robust and more important explanators of capital spending than stock prices.,2001-11-30
"However, some careful research--again partly conducted by Federal Reserve economists--suggests that a cost-of-capital effect on investment comes through clearly in empirical models based either on natural experiments with exogenous shocks to the cost of capital or on other econometric techniques that identify the exogenous parts of observed changes in user cost.3 Other recent work suggests that investment is also affected by at least those movements in stock prices that reflect the discounted value of expected profits.4 This important literature is too complex for me to review in detail today.",2001-11-30
"Let me say simply that, despite the empirical puzzles, I believe that the cost-of-capital effect is likely to be at work when stock prices rise or fall significantly.",2001-11-30
"The discount factors incorporate both risk-free interest rates and equity premia, but I will refer to the discount factors simply as interest rates.",2001-11-30
"Consider the effect of an increase in expected profits, say from a spurt in productivity.",2001-11-30
"Now consider instead the effect of a decrease in interest rates, setting aside for a moment the implications of the interest-rate decline for investment and future output.",2001-11-30
A further complication in evaluating these two scenarios is that the aggregate response of household spending and investment will generally feed back to asset markets and generate further changes in prices and discount rates.,2001-11-30
But the basic point is that wealth changes reflecting future profits (or productivity) and wealth changes reflecting interest rates could have very different effects on consumption.,2001-11-30
I believe that further research on both the theoretical and empirical aspects of this issue could contribute significantly to our understanding of the relationship between asset prices and macroeconomic outcomes.,2001-11-30
"The basic puzzle is this: Roughly speaking, the population currently occupies the stock of residential real estate and will continue to do so no matter what happens to its price.",2001-11-30
Suppose there is a rise in the relative price of housing.,2001-11-30
"To articulate the puzzle more carefully, suppose that I intend to live in my current house forever and that the price of the house increases because of a decline in the discount rate for future housing services.",2001-11-30
"Yet, as I noted earlier, the empirical evidence supports the view that changes in the price of residential real estate do affect household spending.",2001-11-30
"One possibility is that the hypothesized increase in the price of my house reflects a change in the housing services that the house is expected to provide, perhaps because individuals have come to think that houses will depreciate more slowly in the future than we had believed.",2001-11-30
"In this situation, a higher house price would be accompanied by an increase in my real consumption of housing services over time but--as long as I stayed in the same house--by no change in my consumption of other goods and services.",2001-11-30
"These individuals, who plan to “downsize” their housing over time, are truly better off when house prices increase, and any standard theory would predict that they will increase their consumption.",2001-11-30
"These “upsizers” are worse off when house prices increase, and they will reduce their consumption of non-housing goods and services.",2001-11-30
The effect of changes in house prices on desired aggregate consumption depends on the relative number of individuals in these two groups and their marginal propensities to consume out of housing wealth.,2001-11-30
"In addition, its value is somewhat uncertain: Although general trends in real estate prices can be easily observed, nobody receives a statement in the mail saying how much his or her home is worth, and nobody can look up the value of his or her home in the newspaper.",2001-11-30
"Recent Experience and the Response of Monetary Policy Let me now turn to the recent U.S. experience, including the macroeconomic consequences of movements in asset prices since the mid-1990s and the response of monetary policymakers.",2001-11-30
"Between early 1995 and the peak in early 2000, the Wilshire 5000 stock-price index (which is a broad measure of equity prices) tripled, adding nearly $12 trillion to the wealth of U.S. households.",2001-11-30
"Since the peak, the Wilshire 5000 has dropped by about one-third, corresponding to a loss in wealth of roughly $6 trillion.5 Not only have the recent movements in U.S. stock prices been extremely large, they have arguably affected more households than did past movements in the stock market because of the broadening ownership of corporate equities in the United States.",2001-11-30
"As stock prices soared in the 1990s, the share of equity holdings in household portfolios surpassed the share of owner-occupied housing.",2001-11-30
Now let me turn to the influence of these movements in asset prices on the conduct of monetary policy.,2001-11-30
"The fundamental goal of our policy is to achieve maximum sustainable output and employment, which can be reached best in an environment of price stability.",2001-11-30
"Therefore, the Federal Reserve must take an active interest in all the factors that affect economic performance, including business and consumer confidence, economic growth abroad, the foreign exchange value of the dollar, fiscal policy, and, of course, asset prices.",2001-11-30
We take the level of the stock market into account when we consider the economic outlook and monetary policy.,2001-11-30
But let me be clear: We do not target a particular level of equity prices.,2001-11-30
"We attempt simply to judge the likely influence of the stock market as well as other important factors on the level of aggregate demand and aggregate supply and, hence, on the economy’s ability to achieve price stability and maximum sustainable employment.",2001-11-30
"While our goal of price stability can foster a favorable environment for business investment, we make no pretense to being able to control how that plays out in the stock market.",2001-11-30
"We cannot avoid gauging the effect of the stock market on economic performance, but we do not target stock prices.",2001-11-30
"The dramatic movements in asset prices over the past several years have affected aggregate demand and, to some extent, aggregate supply in the United States.",2001-11-30
"In the late 1990s, the growth rate of U.S. labor productivity increased beyond the expectations of most observers.",2001-11-30
An important source of the faster pace of productivity was a surge in capital spending fostered by the development of new technology.,2001-11-30
"Faster productivity growth was among the factors that boosted equity valuations; in turn, larger expected productivity advances and a lower cost of equity capital provided a further stimulus to investment.",2001-11-30
The pickup in investment combined with the wealth effect on consumption to boost aggregate demand.,2001-11-30
The rapid pace of investment also helped to hold down inflationary pressures by increasing the growth of productive capacity.,2001-11-30
"However, by the summer of 1999, the persistent strength of domestic demand and tightening resource utilization in the United States, especially for labor, heightened concern among policymakers that inflationary pressures could undermine the impressive performance of the economy.",2001-11-30
"Accordingly, the Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates.",2001-11-30
The objective was not to bring down the stock market but rather to bring the growth of aggregate demand and aggregate supply into better alignment.,2001-11-30
"This reassessment depressed equity prices for high-tech firms, and it has significantly restrained investment in these types of equipment, which had been substantial contributors to the previously rapid rate of economic growth.",2001-11-30
Slowing investment and a shift from a positive to a negative wealth effect on consumption have significantly damped the growth in aggregate final demand since late last year.,2001-11-30
"These factors, and many others, have informed our decision to shift the stance of monetary policy aggressively and reduce the target federal funds rate by 4-1/2 percentage points since the beginning of the year.",2001-11-30
Conclusion Hence there is no question that asset prices influence the macroeconomy.,2001-11-30
But one would think that wealth changes coming from investors’ re-evaluation of future profits would have different effects from those coming from interest-rate changes or changes in the relative price of housing.,2001-11-30
"Jason G. Cummins, Kevin A. Hassett, and R. Glenn Hubbard, “A Reconsideration of Investment Behavior Using Tax Reforms as Natural Experiments,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 2:1994, pp.",2001-11-30
"The title of this year's conference was ""New Challenges for Monetary Policy.""",1999-10-12
The papers described both the emerging consensus about the objectives and strategies underlying the conduct of monetary policy and highlighted a number of new challenges.,1999-10-12
"In the first section of today's lecture I will outline the framework and identify the objectives of monetary policy, describe the operational procedures used to conduct monetary policy, and discuss the strategy for carrying out monetary policy to achieve those objectives.",1999-10-12
"A number of participates at the conference suggested that there was an emerging consensus about the appropriate strategy--specifically, flexible inflation targeting.",1999-10-12
Then I will turn to the new challenges for monetary policy identified at the conference.,1999-10-12
"First, does a low-inflation environment--and specifically the possibility that nominal interest rates might decline to zero in such an environment--constrain the effectiveness of monetary policy, and if so, how can monetary policy adjust to maintain its effectiveness?",1999-10-12
"Second, how should monetary policy respond to movements in asset prices in general and, specifically, to the possibility of asset-market bubbles?",1999-10-12
"Third, what is the best option for exchange rate and monetary policy regimes for small open emerging market countries, in light of increased globalization and especially larger and more volatile international capital flows?",1999-10-12
The basic theme of the conference was that flexible inflation targeting provides a constructive response to each of these challenges.,1999-10-12
"Careful design and implementation of the framework, including the choice of an inflation target, would, for example, reduce the prospect that monetary policy might lose its ability to stimulate the economy further because nominal short-term interest rates had fallen to zero.",1999-10-12
"Similarly, following such a disciplined monetary policy would mitigate, though not entirely eliminate, the effect of asset bubbles.",1999-10-12
"Finally, countries that move to a flexible exchange rate regime--as many have done recently--need to put in place a disciplined monetary framework such as is offered by this approach.",1999-10-12
"The Monetary Policy Framework Let me start this discussion by identifying what the objectives of monetary policy are, and should be, and then discuss what strategies are useful in achieving the objectives.",1999-10-12
"Objectives of Monetary Policy One of the themes of the conference was that there is an emerging consensus about the objectives of monetary policy, one that has been reflected in the conduct of monetary policy in many countries for some time and now is finding its way into the rhetoric of policymakers.",1999-10-12
I would describe the consensus as an acceptance of a dual mandate for monetary policy.,1999-10-12
"Monetary policy seeks first to achieve and maintain price stability over the longer run and, second, to retain the flexibility to damp cyclical fluctuations in the economy around full employment.",1999-10-12
"At the conference, the consensus was described as ""flexible inflation targeting.""",1999-10-12
"Most central banks want to emphasize, with good reason, their price stability objective.",1999-10-12
"First, monetary policy, in the long run, principally affects nominal variables such as nominal income, the price level, and the rate of inflation, but has lesser effects on real variables--such as the level of employment or the level or growth rate of output.",1999-10-12
I expect all central bankers would agree that an environment of price stability offers the best contribution that monetary policy can make to the level and growth of output because it eliminates distortions to resource allocation and disincentives to saving and investment associated with high and variable inflation rates.,1999-10-12
It follows that a more accommodative monetary policy cannot foster a higher average rate of real growth.,1999-10-12
"The second strongly held view is that because monetary policy is the principal determinant of the inflation rate in the long run, central banks have a responsibility to set an appropriate target for long-run inflation and achieve it.",1999-10-12
"And that target should be price stability or, at the least, a low rate of inflation.",1999-10-12
"While monetary policy cannot raise the level or rate of growth of output over the long run through any means other than maintaining price stability, it is widely, though not universally, accepted that monetary policy can affect the level and growth rate of output in the short run and, perhaps, therefore contribute to smoothing out fluctuations in the economy around full employment.",1999-10-12
This is sometimes referred to as the short-run stabilization objective for monetary policy.,1999-10-12
A central issue for monetary policy is how to balance the dual objectives of price stability and output stabilization and how explicit to be about the commitment to these dual objectives.,1999-10-12
"Both theoretical and, especially, empirical macroeconomics have established the existence of an inescapable trade-off affecting the conduct of monetary policy.",1999-10-12
The trade-off is between the variability of inflation around its target (zero or some low rate) and the variability of output around its target (the full-employment level of output or potential output).,1999-10-12
"Autonomous increases or decreases in aggregate spending push output and inflation in the same direction relative to their targets and, therefore, do not bring this trade-off into play.",1999-10-12
But supply shocks--such as increases or decreases in oil or food prices--drive output and inflation in opposite directions relative to their respective targets.,1999-10-12
"The more quickly monetary policy reacts to restore inflation to its target following a supply shock, the greater will be the variability in output relative to its target.",1999-10-12
The reason for this trade-off is that monetary policy affects inflation primarily through its initial effect on the amount of slack in the economy.,1999-10-12
"Tightening monetary policy slows spending growth, opens up some slack temporarily in labor and product markets, and allows the slack to reduce inflation.",1999-10-12
"Once inflation has returned to its target, policy can guide the economy back to full employment.",1999-10-12
"It probably takes a certain amount of slack over time to reduce inflation by a given amount, but reducing inflation rapidly means opening up an especially large output gap for a short period--hence the trade-off between inflation and output stability.",1999-10-12
"Several countries have moved to inflation-targeting regimes over the last decade or so, setting a numerical target for inflation.",1999-10-12
"This was generally part of a process of shifting responsibility for monetary policy from finance ministries to independent central banks and often followed a period of poor macroeconomic performance, especially high and variable inflation.",1999-10-12
The newly independent central banks often identified inflation as the singular objective of monetary policy to gain credibility and facilitate the transition to price stability.,1999-10-12
"With price stability now largely accomplished, some of these central banks are becoming more flexible in their approaches to monetary policy by recognizing a role for short-run stabilization.",1999-10-12
"In the United States, Congress has set the objectives for monetary policy in the Federal Reserve Act, as amended in 1977.",1999-10-12
"The objectives are maximum employment and stable prices, which are mutually consistent and achievable if maximum employment is interpreted as the maximum employment sustainable without rising or falling inflation.",1999-10-12
"Inflation-targeting countries typically have goals of about 2 percent to 2 ½ percent for inflation and sometimes establish a range for inflation, for example, 1 percent to 3 percent.",1999-10-12
"It was widely agreed at Jackson Hole that the United States has, without an explicit target, achieved the same success in reducing inflation as countries with explicit numerical targets.",1999-10-12
"I will not be considering the pros and cons of an explicit numerical target for inflation today, although I recognize this is an important question and one that warrants further discussion.",1999-10-12
"Virtually all central banks carry out monetary policy operations by influencing--in effect setting--some short-term nominal interest rate, typically the rate on overnight inter-bank loans.",1999-10-12
"By adjusting this single rate, the Federal Reserve affects the broader array of interest rates and asset prices in the economy and, in turn, affects aggregate demand, the level of real economic activity, and inflation.",1999-10-12
There are two ways of describing the strategy for monetary policy.,1999-10-12
"One focuses on ""instrument rules,"" which describe how the policy instrument--in this case a short-term interest rate--should be moved in response to economic developments.",1999-10-12
The Taylor Rule describes how the federal funds rate should be adjusted in response to movements in output relative to its long-run sustainable level and to movements in inflation relative to its target.,1999-10-12
The Taylor Rule thus explicitly embodies the dual objectives of monetary policy and is a form of flexible inflation targeting.,1999-10-12
"In practice, no one expects monetary policy to be conducted according to a rigid rule.",1999-10-12
"Such rules can, however, be useful in informing policy decisions and helping policymakers calibrate their responses to changes in utilization and inflation rates.",1999-10-12
A second strategy is to move the instrument in response to the inflation forecast.,1999-10-12
"In this approach, the policymakers start with a forecast of inflation over some interval, typically about two years.",1999-10-12
Policy is then set over this interval to achieve the price stability target by the end of the period.,1999-10-12
"The interval chosen to reach the inflation target takes into account the fact that the more rapid the return to the target, the greater the variability in output relative to its target.",1999-10-12
The time interval is thus a vehicle for allowing policymakers to damp movements in output around full employment and at the same time ensure that the inflation objective is eventually achieved.,1999-10-12
Inflation forecast targeting has the advantage of being explicitly forward-looking.,1999-10-12
"The Taylor Rule takes explicit account of only very recent observations on inflation and output, but these are, to be sure, important determinants of future inflation.",1999-10-12
An inflation forecast approach allows policymakers to consider a wider range of current and past information in projecting future outcomes.,1999-10-12
"D. Setting the Inflation Target Setting the inflation target to be consistent with price stability sounds straightforward, but an important theme at this summer's conference was the variety of options and implications of this choice.",1999-10-12
"The obvious choice would be a target of zero for inflation, taking into account biases in published price measures.",1999-10-12
But an intriguing alternative is to set a target for the price level.,1999-10-12
"If a disturbance results in a period of inflation, under a zero inflation target, the objective is to return to a zero inflation rate.",1999-10-12
"When inflation has been returned to zero, however, the price level will be higher than it was before the disturbance.",1999-10-12
"Under a constant price level target, the aim is to return to the initial price level, requiring a period of deflation to offset the effect of the period of higher inflation.",1999-10-12
"This can produce a more predictable price level in the long run, but many analysts are concerned about how the economy would respond to a period of deflation.",1999-10-12
Yet another alternative is to target a low positive inflation rate--specifically an inflation rate somewhat above a level that reflected estimates of the bias in published measures.,1999-10-12
"One of the issues I will discuss shortly is whether targeting a low, positive rate of ""true"" inflation (what I call price stability plus cushion) might result in better cyclical performance of the economy than a zero inflation target.",1999-10-12
Still another choice is an average inflation target.,1999-10-12
"If the target was 2 percent and inflation temporarily moved to 3 percent, an average inflation target policy would encourage a decline in the inflation rate to below 2 percent for a while, moving the average back to 2 percent.",1999-10-12
"This allows for a predictable (albeit rising) long-run price level, while avoiding the deflationary episodes that would occasionally be called for under a constant price level target.",1999-10-12
Monetary Policy in a Low-Inflation Environment I turn now to the challenges associated with the conduct of monetary policy in a low-inflation environment.,1999-10-12
"The issue here is whether, at very low inflation rates, the cyclical performance of the economy would deteriorate.",1999-10-12
"If this were the case, the objectives or strategy of monetary policy would need to be adjusted.",1999-10-12
"Among the possible responses is adjusting the definition of the inflation target, so I will be building on the preceding discussion.",1999-10-12
"A. Keynes' Liquidity Trap and the Zero Nominal Bound Problem John Maynard Keynes, in his classic work, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, warned that monetary policy might become ineffective once interest rates fell to some low level at which wealth owners might become indifferent as to whether they held money or bonds.",1999-10-12
"In this case, it would be impossible for monetary policy to affect interest rates by affecting the composition of portfolios, specifically the amount of money held relative to bonds.",1999-10-12
"But with short-term rates now at zero in Japan and low inflation almost everywhere in the industrialized world, the problem is taken more seriously by central banks--to the point that it was one of the topics at Jackson Hole.",1999-10-12
"The liquidity trap, as Keynes used the term, is better thought of as a term-structure trap or, more generally, a limit on how low long-term and private interest rates can go once the interest rate on short-term government debt is pushed to zero.",1999-10-12
"When short-term government rates reached zero, Keynes believed that there would still be positive interest rates on both longer-term government securities and private debt and that monetary policy then would be unable to push those rates any lower.",1999-10-12
The liquidity trap is sometimes referred to as the problem of the zero bound on nominal interest rates.,1999-10-12
"Nominal interest rates cannot be negative, because, in this case, every one would want to hold cash.",1999-10-12
"Consequently, an environment of very low inflation would constrain how low monetary policy could push real interest rates in response to a recession and, therefore, be associated with less-favorable cyclical performance of the economy.",1999-10-12
"If inflation were 2 percent, for example, monetary policy, by driving the nominal interest rate to zero, could push real interest rates to minus 2 percent.",1999-10-12
"If prices were stable, on the other hand, the limit on the real interest rate would be zero, and this limit might constrain the ability of monetary policy to offset downward shocks to the economy.",1999-10-12
"B. Nominal Rigidities Another long-standing explanation for why low inflation might result in a deterioration in macroeconomic performance is the possible existence of nominal wage rigidities--specifically, a reluctance to reduce nominal wages.",1999-10-12
"When inflation is very low, achieving this variation in relative real wages depends on some wages falling.",1999-10-12
"If nominal wage cuts are rare, efficiency in the allocation of resources may decline, and as a result, output might be lower at price stability than if there were some low rate of inflation.",1999-10-12
"And in the absence of declines in nominal wages for some workers, average real wages will be higher, and hence average employment lower, at price stability.",1999-10-12
"Although there is some evidence of downward nominal wage rigidity, there is no evidence that this has an effect on aggregate wage and price inflation or the natural rate of unemployment in the postwar period--even when inflation has been very low.",1999-10-12
"In addition, it is not clear how much rigidity would remain if we achieved and sustained steady low inflation.",1999-10-12
"C. Japan's Current Experience As I noted earlier, Japan presents a laboratory for observing an economy with low inflation.",1999-10-12
Japan enjoyed effective price stability through most of the 1980s.,1999-10-12
"In continuing its efforts to move the economy toward recovery, the Bank of Japan last February lowered short-term interest rates to almost zero.",1999-10-12
"Although Japan registered surprisingly robust growth in the first half, most observers see private-sector demand as still quite weak despite the low short-term rates.",1999-10-12
"How could monetary policymakers have avoided this predicament, and once they were in it were there unconventional forms of monetary policy that would have permitted them to provide additional stimulus to demand?",1999-10-12
"D. How to Avoid the Problem At the Jackson Hole conference, Mervyn King and Lars Svensson argued that a flexible inflation-targeting regime would help policymakers avoid this problem in the first place.",1999-10-12
"While King in particular had some doubts about the zero nominal interest rate bound and especially about the existence of nominal rigidities, both he and Svensson noted that opting for a positive inflation rate as a target was a prudent way of avoiding testing either of these hypotheses.",1999-10-12
"Indeed, they both noted that inflation-targeting central banks virtually always opt for inflation targets greater than zero and greater than estimates of the inflation bias in published measures of inflation.",1999-10-12
Recent research suggests that even a cushion of 1 percentage point (above an amount equal to the expected bias in inflation measures) can go a long way toward avoiding the problem of deteriorating cyclical performance at low inflation rates.,1999-10-12
The second key to avoiding this problem is to have a symmetrical inflation target.,1999-10-12
This means one that evokes an aggressive response to both falling below and to rising above the inflation target.,1999-10-12
"Monetary policymakers can always choke-off inflation by raising real interest rates, because there is no limit to how high real interest rates can be pushed.",1999-10-12
"There is a limit, however, to how low real interest rates can decline, given the zero nominal interest rate bound.",1999-10-12
"Therefore, to the degree that any asymmetry is called for, it might be to move more quickly and more decisively with respect to downward than to upward disturbances to aggregate demand, at least when beginning from already low nominal interest rates.",1999-10-12
A third possibility is that the zero nominal bound problem can be reduced or eliminated either by a credible price level target or by an average inflation target.,1999-10-12
"If the price level falls in response to downside shocks, a price level target will imply that monetary policy will move more aggressively to stimulate the economy, once demand recovers and monetary policy has regained its effectiveness, than would have been the case with a traditional inflation target.",1999-10-12
This would ensure that a period of deflation will be followed by a corresponding period of inflation.,1999-10-12
"Assuming bondholders take into account this more aggressive stimulus, bondholders will project that zero nominal short-term interest rates will be maintained longer than would otherwise be the case, justifying lower long-term interest rates today.",1999-10-12
A similar result could be achieved by an average inflation target.,1999-10-12
"If inflation was zero for a while, bondholders would project a period of inflation above the long-run inflation target--for example, 3 percent or 4 percent instead of 2 percent--until the average inflation rate returned to 2 percent.",1999-10-12
This would lead to expectations that short-term interest rates would remain low for a longer period and contribute to a decline in real long-term rates today.,1999-10-12
"If a target for price level, positive inflation rate, or average inflation rate had not been implemented and made credible before a central bank was confronted by zero nominal interest rates, the central bank could, of course, introduce them at that time.",1999-10-12
"Moreover, with prices falling and the economy in recession, one could imagine a good deal of skepticism about the ability of the central bank to meet its objective.",1999-10-12
Paul Krugman has urged the Bank of Japan to move to a positive inflation target as a way of lowering real interest rates and stimulating the economy.,1999-10-12
"The Bank of Japan has resisted, arguing that, given its inability to increase aggregate demand, there would be little credibility in setting a positive inflation target.",1999-10-12
"Even if the Bank of Japan today cannot expect to stimulate demand and thereby raise inflation, they will almost surely have this opportunity well before today's long-term bonds mature.",1999-10-12
They could therefore commit today to maintaining a positive inflation rate when it becomes possible and thereby raise inflation expectations today and lower real interest rates.,1999-10-12
"However, such a distant increase in inflation might not have much impact on the real cost of borrowing today, so I continue to be skeptical that initiating an inflation targeting approach, once confronted by the zero nominal bound, offers a reliable way out of the zero nominal bound problem.",1999-10-12
A second approach would be to undertake unconventional monetary policy operations.,1999-10-12
"Conventional monetary policy is implemented, as I described, by employing open market operations concentrated in repurchase agreements or in the short end of the government debt market.",1999-10-12
"An alternative approach, sometimes referred to as a monetization strategy, focuses on increasing the money supply rather than on the level of short-term interest rates.",1999-10-12
"At Jackson Hole, Allan Meltzer offered a clear framework for the way such a policy direction might allow additional stimulus after conventional operations had lowered nominal short-term interest rates to zero.",1999-10-12
"In the typical model, money and bonds become perfect substitutes at some low interest rate, perhaps zero, and we have a liquidity trap where monetary policy loses its power to add further stimulus by lowering interest rates on bonds.",1999-10-12
Meltzer suggested this result reflects more the limits of the typical model than the limits on monetary policy.,1999-10-12
"In an activist approach, monetary policy would increase the sum of the money supply and short-term government debt--the assets that have become perfect substitutes--by widening the scope of open market operations to include purchases of long-term government debt and perhaps private debt and foreign exchange.",1999-10-12
"Such operations might lower interest rates on long-term and private securities and/or result in a depreciation of the currency, in all cases stimulating aggregate demand.",1999-10-12
This will be the outcome of deflation as long as the central bank does not let the nominal money supply decline as the price level falls.,1999-10-12
"The net result will be lower interest rates on long-term and private securities and higher values of equities that, in turn, will stimulate spending, over and above the stimulus that results from the wealth effect associated with increased real money balances.",1999-10-12
Important questions relate to both the theoretical structure of asset demands and empirical evidence about portfolio behavior and asset markets.,1999-10-12
The issue of whether relative supply of short and long-term bonds affects the term structure of interest rates is crucial.,1999-10-12
"The most widely accepted theory of the term structure, called the pure expectations model, holds that long-term interest rates are a weighted average of current and expected future short-term rates.",1999-10-12
"I have never given much weight to the role of relative supply effects in affecting the term structure or exchange rates, given the failure of empirical studies to find much evidence of such effects.",1999-10-12
"Of course, at the extreme, the Bank of Japan could set the price and hence interest rate on long-term bonds if it was prepared to take all these assets onto its balance sheet.",1999-10-12
Another reason for skepticism is that the domestic channel through which monetary policy works in Japan operates very importantly through the banking system.,1999-10-12
"In this case, attention shifts to the effect of monetization on exchange rates and to the recommendation that the Bank of Japan raise the money supply by purchasing foreign currency, an operation sometimes referred to as unsterilized exchange rate intervention.",1999-10-12
There is a case in which unsterilized intervention has a more powerful effect on exchange rates than sterilized intervention (where the central bank absorbs any reverses introduced as part of exchange rate intervention).,1999-10-12
"But this incremental effect arises because unsterilized intervention is expected to lower the country's interest rates and the lower interest rates would, in turn, put downward pressure on the country's exchange rate.",1999-10-12
"If the interest rate channel does not operate because of a liquidity trap, this could raise questions about the effect of unsterilized foreign exchange intervention.",1999-10-12
This could affect a range of interest rates and the exchange rate.,1999-10-12
"Therefore, implementing a monetization strategy in this way would appear to shift the decision about the timing and magnitude of monetary policy from the newly independent central bank back to the Ministry of Finance.",1999-10-12
"Nevertheless, if the Japanese economy fails to respond to the policies now in place, one could argue for some experimentation in this direction, given the absence of other options for monetary policy.",1999-10-12
"Finally, in cases of a nominal interest rate bound, fiscal policy could and should carry more of the stabilization burden, as has been the case in Japan recently.",1999-10-12
Asset Market Bubbles and Monetary Policy Let me move to the challenge of how monetary policy should respond to suspicions of asset market bubbles.,1999-10-12
An asset market bubble refers to an extended increase in the price of assets not justified by the fundamentals.,1999-10-12
"I do find it plausible that market prices might sometimes, and for some period, depart from values that are justified by fundamental forces.",1999-10-12
"The fundamental value of a stock is the present value of the expected earnings stream of the firm in question, derived by applying a discount factor that accounts for both the interest rate on safe assets and a risk factor appropriate to the uncertainties about the expected future earnings stream.",1999-10-12
The fundamentals underpinning the price of equities are therefore the expected increase in earnings and the discount rate that transforms expected earnings into a price for the asset.,1999-10-12
"Equity prices could rise above their fundamental value if investors hold unrealistic expectations about earnings growth, if they assume that the earnings stream is more stable than it will turn out to be, or if they otherwise believe there is less risk associated with holding the equities than turns out to be the case.",1999-10-12
A similar process underlies the price of real property.,1999-10-12
"Monetary policy, as I emphasized earlier, focuses on price stability and damping fluctuations around full employment.",1999-10-12
"Should it also focus on encouraging asset prices to return toward perceived fundamental value, if asset prices appear to depart significantly from policymakers' perception of that fundamental value?",1999-10-12
"During the 1980s, the Japanese economy registered very strong growth, low inflation, and soaring equity and property prices.",1999-10-12
"In 1989, following a tightening of monetary policy, there was a sharp collapse in asset prices.",1999-10-12
Equity prices fell by 60 percent and urban land values by more than 75 percent.,1999-10-12
"In addition to direct effects via the decline in wealth on consumer spending, the collapse of asset prices had a devastating effect on the banking system.",1999-10-12
Japanese banks therefore suffered a double blow in the collapse of equity and property prices.,1999-10-12
Many have viewed the surge in equity prices in the United States over the past four years as evidence of a bubble.,1999-10-12
It is true that the rise in equity prices--averaging 25 percent to 30 percent a year over the last four years--is unprecedented and that current values challenge previous valuation standards.,1999-10-12
But one could argue that structural changes in the economy have raised the sustainable level and growth of earnings and lowered the volatility of earnings or otherwise reduced the perceived risk in equities.,1999-10-12
"Such structural changes could, in principle, justify at least a substantial portion of the rise in equity prices.",1999-10-12
But the question at issue here is whether policymakers should substitute their judgment about fundamental value for the market's assessment and use monetary policy to encourage a convergence back to their own estimate of fundamental value.,1999-10-12
They used a methodology that has proved valuable in studying a number of other questions related to the strategy of monetary policy.,1999-10-12
They observe the resulting variability of inflation and output relative to their respective targets.,1999-10-12
The base model includes a policy rule according to which short-term interest rates are adjusted in response to economic developments.,1999-10-12
"Bernanke and Gertler examine whether an attempt by policymakers to return equity prices toward their estimate of fundamental value improves macroeconomic performance, judged in terms of inflation variability and output variability.",1999-10-12
"They find that policymakers cannot improve the outcomes by responding directly to suspected deviations of equity prices from fundamentals, but that a policy focused on achieving price stability and damping fluctuations around full employment will mitigate the adverse consequences of equity market bubbles.",1999-10-12
"That is, a monetary policy focused on price stability and output stabilization will respond to the effects of higher equity prices on aggregate demand, real economic activity, and inflation.",1999-10-12
"This will generally dampen movements in equity prices, while contributing to meeting the broader macroeconomic objectives of monetary policy.",1999-10-12
"However, given the difficulty in distinguishing between changes in asset prices dominated by fundamental forces and those driven by non-fundamental forces, policymakers should not target asset prices or try to guide them to the policymakers' estimate of fundamental value.",1999-10-12
The discussion of the paper by Rudy Dornbusch and comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan added an important additional theme related to monetary policy and equity prices.,1999-10-12
So it is with equity prices.,1999-10-12
Monetary policymakers sometimes face additional problems in the case of such steep declines in asset values.,1999-10-12
"It is not simply that interest rates on private securities rise, but that virtually all buying and selling may temporarily cease.",1999-10-12
"In such situations, monetary policy typically intervenes to provide liquidity, until markets recover and begin to operate more normally.",1999-10-12
"Because of this, it is sometimes alleged that monetary policy stands ready to intervene to protect market prices in a downturn.",1999-10-12
"Chairman Greenspan commented that markets are asymmetric, not monetary policy.",1999-10-12
He emphasized that monetary policy does not operate with a target for equity prices when they are falling any more than it does when equity prices are rising.,1999-10-12
"In both cases, monetary policy responds only indirectly to equity prices, by taking equity prices into account in the assessment of aggregate demand.",1999-10-12
"But monetary policy has to respond quickly to the special circumstances that accompany a collapse of asset values, specifically the extreme illiquidity and seizing up of credit markets.",1999-10-12
"Globalization and Monetary Policy: Choosing Exchange Rate and Monetary Policy Regimes The world economy has become increasingly globalized over the last couple of decades, measured both by the flow of trade among countries and especially by the flow of international capital.",1999-10-12
"An important challenge facing central banks around the world is how this globalization has affected their ability to pursue domestic objectives with monetary policy and, indeed, whether it is even possible to preserve an independent monetary policy.",1999-10-12
"The freedom to pursue an independent monetary policy will be determined, to an important degree, by the choice of exchange rate regime.",1999-10-12
"A government that pegs its exchange rate to another country, for example, gives up its ability to pursue an independent monetary policy.",1999-10-12
Its interest rates must be set to support the fixed exchange rate and will generally move with the interest rate in the country to which it is pegged.,1999-10-12
"Countries pegged to the dollar, in effect, are tied to the monetary policy pursued by the United States.",1999-10-12
Such regimes are particularly effective ways to make a transition from hyperinflation to the low inflation rate of the country to which the currency is pegged.,1999-10-12
"For example, if the country has no history of an independent central bank successfully achieving low inflation, the country might be better off abandoning the attempt at independent monetary policy and buying into another country's monetary policy and inflation outcomes.",1999-10-12
"This is precisely the decision made by Argentina, and it has contributed to maintaining low inflation, following the transition from hyperinflation that had been achieved just prior to its decision to fix its exchange rate to the dollar.",1999-10-12
"It follows that if a country wants to have an independent monetary policy, it must choose a flexible exchange rate regime and if it chooses a flexible exchange rate regime it must complement it with a disciplined monetary policy.",1999-10-12
Many countries pursuing this course have opted for flexible inflation targeting.,1999-10-12
"But, under any exchange rate regime, small open economies in general and emerging market economies in particular are challenged by volatile international capital flows.",1999-10-12
The challenge under an adjustable peg--a regime in which the exchange rate is fixed at any point in time but can be adjusted over time--is particularly severe.,1999-10-12
These very transactions will make it difficult for the country to sustain its current exchange rate.,1999-10-12
"For a while, the country may sustain its current exchange rate by buying its currency with dollar reserves at the fixed exchange rate and raising its interest rates.",1999-10-12
"In addition, the higher interest rates used to defend the exchange rate may threaten a sharp decline in the economy and a collapse of the banking system.",1999-10-12
"When this happens, currency values and equity prices often plunge below appropriate levels, with resulting adverse consequences to the real economy.",1999-10-12
"The conventional wisdom today is that small open economies face a choice of one of the extremes--either a flexible exchange rate regime complemented by a disciplined monetary policy or a very fixed exchange rate regime, characterized by a currency board or by adopting some other country's currency, as in dollarization.",1999-10-12
This automatically pushes up domestic interest rates to support the currency.,1999-10-12
"The value of the currency board is that it puts domestic monetary policy on automatic pilot, and guarantees that policy will move aggressively to support the fixed exchange rate when it is under attack.",1999-10-12
The markets no longer have to worry about the willingness of the policy authorities to adjust interest rates aggressively enough to support the currency.,1999-10-12
Dollarization increases the commitment of a country to a fixed exchange rate.,1999-10-12
"It therefore faces dollar interest rates, although these rates will not necessarily be the same as those prevailing in the United States.",1999-10-12
Once again it has given up independent monetary policy.,1999-10-12
The advantage of this regime is that it might reduce risk premia that remain in domestic interest rates under a currency board that reflect the risk that the currency board might be abandoned.,1999-10-12
"At the Jackson Hole conference, Eichengreen and Hausmann presented a discussion of the choice between flexible and very fixed exchange rates for small open economies.",1999-10-12
"In either case, the government and private citizens are subjected to the risks of unexpected changes in short-term interest rates and/or to the risks of a change in exchange rates.",1999-10-12
"The best choice over time would appear to be to develop robust domestic institutions and pursue sound policies, including a disciplined monetary policy, and adopt a flexible exchange rate regime.",1999-10-12
"There are, I believe, many advantages to a flexible exchange rate regime.",1999-10-12
It avoids the problem of choosing the right level at which to fix the exchange rate.,1999-10-12
"It allows exchange rates to move in response to shocks or structural trends, alleviating the need for other aspects of the economy--such as domestic demand or the level of wages and prices--to carry the burden of adjustment.",1999-10-12
"Floating exchange rates also serve as indicators of investor confidence, providing feedback to policymakers as to whether they are pursuing appropriate policies.",1999-10-12
Floating and perhaps volatile exchange rates also remind both borrowers and lenders of the risks inherent in international finance and may militate against the development of bubbles and excessive capital flows.,1999-10-12
"Finally, where the monetary authority is sufficiently credible and disciplined, floating exchange rates allow for independent and perhaps countercyclical monetary policy.",1999-10-12
"So, an important issue is how much of the prevailing risk premia faced by small open emerging market economies is due to exchange rate risk and how much to other considerations.",1999-10-12
"On balance, I continue to lean toward flexible exchange rate regimes, but now better appreciate that there could be circumstances favorable to very fixed exchange rate regimes, including as a transition to flexible exchange rates, once the credibility of a country's economic policies and institutions is sufficiently developed.",1999-10-12
There is an emerging consensus toward flexible inflation targeting.,1999-10-12
"Some central banks are more transparent about the dual objectives and some are more explicit about the inflation target, but there is a broad agreement about what the targets should be.",1999-10-12
"There is somewhat less agreement about how monetary policy should be conducted to achieve the targets, but some convergence here as well.",1999-10-12
"While there are some intriguing new ideas about price level or average inflation targets, the consensus based on practice and recent performance around the world is that a low, but positive inflation target remains prudent.",1999-10-12
I refer to this target as price stability plus a cushion.,1999-10-12
The cushion mitigates the risk that monetary policy might lose its ability to provide further stimulus before it was able to adequately damp the effect of downward shocks to the economy.,1999-10-12
The conference offered a better understanding of how a monetization option might allow additional stimulus once monetary policy had pushed the nominal interest rate on short-term government debt to zero.,1999-10-12
"But it did not offer much confidence, to me at least, that monetization is an effective way out of the current predicament in Japan or that initiating an inflation target, once having encountered this problem, would be effective.",1999-10-12
The conference provided some support to the conventional wisdom--at least the conventional wisdom inside the Federal Reserve--about how monetary policy should or should not respond to suspected asset market bubbles.,1999-10-12
"The conference also provided a nicely balanced assessment of the choice between the extreme solutions for exchange rate regimes--that is, between flexible and very fixed exchange rate regimes.",1999-10-12
"While the discussion clarified the problems and choices, it still left me still leaning toward flexible exchange rates.",1999-10-12
"New Challenges for Monetary Policy A Symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Jackson Hole, Wyoming August 26-28, 1999 Opening Remarks Alan Greenspan, Chairman, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Challenges for Monetary Policy: New and Old Mervyn King, Deputy Governor, Bank of England Commentary John Taylor, Professor, Stanford University What is the Appropriate Role for Monetary Policy in the Presence of Asset Bubbles and Financial Crises?",1999-10-12
A central bank’s raising interest rates is rarely popular.,1997-05-08
"But the Federal Reserve’s action on March 25, to tighten the stance of monetary policy, seems to have attracted more than the usual share of attention and criticism.",1997-05-08
"So tonight, I would like to take a few minutes to put this action in the broad context of the Fed’s mandate to promote the stable financial environment that will encourage economic growth.",1997-05-08
"It was a small prudent step in the face of the increasing possibility that excessive credit creation, spurred by an overly accommodative monetary policy, might undermine the sustained economic expansion.",1997-05-08
That expansion has been fostered by the maintenance of low inflation.,1997-05-08
"But the persisting--indeed increasing--strength of nominal demand for goods and services suggested to us that monetary policy might not be positioned appropriately to avoid a buildup of inflationary pressures and imbalances that would be incompatible with extending the current expansion into 1998, and hopefully beyond.",1997-05-08
For the Federal Reserve to remain inactive against a possible buildup of insidious inflationary pressures would be to sanction a threat to the job security and standards of living of too many Americans.,1997-05-08
"As I pointed out in testimony before the Congress in March, the type of economy that we are now experiencing, with strong growth and tight labor markets, has the special advantage of drawing hundreds of thousands of people onto employment payrolls, where they can acquire permanent work skills.",1997-05-08
It has long been the goal of monetary policy to foster the maximum sustainable growth in the American economy.,1997-05-08
"I emphasize sustainable because it is clear from our history that surges in growth financed by excessive credit creation are, by their nature, unsustainable, and, unless contained, threaten the underlying stability of our economy.",1997-05-08
"Such stability, in turn, is necessary to nurture the sources of permanent growth.",1997-05-08
"The Federal Reserve, of late, has been criticized as being too focused on subduing nonexistent inflation and, in the process, being willing to suppress economic growth, retard job expansion, and inhibit real wage gains.",1997-05-08
"On the contrary, our actions to tighten money market conditions in 1994, and again in March of this year, were directed at sustaining and fostering growth in economic activity, jobs, and real wages.",1997-05-08
Our goal has never been to contain inflation as an end in itself.,1997-05-08
Prices are only signals of how the economy is functioning.,1997-05-08
"If inflation had no effect on economic growth, we would be much less concerned about inflationary pressures.",1997-05-08
But the evidence is compelling that low inflation is necessary to the most favorable performance of the economy.,1997-05-08
"Inflation, as is generally recognized throughout the world, destroys jobs and undermines productivity gains, the foundation for increases in real wages.",1997-05-08
Low inflation is being increasingly viewed as a necessary condition for sustained growth.,1997-05-08
"The Federal Reserve has not always been successful at maintaining sound money and sustained growth, and the lessons have been costly.",1997-05-08
"The Federal Reserve’s policy actions, the evidence demonstrates, affect the financial markets immediately, but work with a significant lag of several quarters or more on output and employment, and even longer on prices.",1997-05-08
"Those who wish for us, in the current environment, to await clearly visible signs of emerging inflation before acting are recommending we return to a failed regime of monetary policy that cost jobs and living standards.",1997-05-08
"I viewed our small increase in the federal funds rate on March 25 as taken not so much as a consequence of a change in the most probable forecast of moderate growth and low inflation for later this year and next, but rather to address the probability that being wrong had materially increased.",1997-05-08
"In the same sense that it would be folly not to endure the small immediate discomfort of a vaccination against the possibility of getting a serious disease, it would have been folly not to take this small prudent step last March to reduce the probabilities that destabilizing inflation would re-emerge.",1997-05-08
"To be sure, 1997 is not 1994 when the Fed was forced to tighten monetary conditions very substantially to avoid accommodating rising inflation.",1997-05-08
"While there is scant evidence of any imminent resurgence of inflation at the moment, there also appears to be little slack in our capacity to produce.",1997-05-08
"Should the expected slowing in the growth of demand fail to materialize, we would need to address any emerging pressures in product and credit markets.",1997-05-08
"To understand the problems of capacity restraint, I should like to spend a few moments on what we have learned over the years about economic growth and the conditions necessary to foster it.",1997-05-08
First it is useful to distinguish between two quite different types of economic growth.,1997-05-08
"One is true, sustainable growth, the other is not.",1997-05-08
True growth reflects the capacity of the economic system to produce goods and services and is based on the growth in productivity and in the labor force.,1997-05-08
"That growth contrasts with the second type, what I would call transitory growth.",1997-05-08
But this is not growth in any meaningful sense of promoting lasting increases in standards of living for our nation.,1997-05-08
"Temporary fluctuations in output owing to say, inventory adjustments, but not financed through excess credit, will quickly adjust on their own and need not concern us as much, provided policy is appropriately positioned to foster sustainable growth.",1997-05-08
"When excessive credit fostered by the central bank finances excess demand, history tells us destabilizing inflationary pressures eventually emerge.",1997-05-08
"For a considerable portion of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, inflationary credit excesses and prices were contained by a gold standard and balanced budgets.",1997-05-08
"Over the long haul, the economy's growth is effectively limited to the expansion of capacity based on productivity and labor force growth.",1997-05-08
"To be sure, it is often difficult to judge whether observed growth is soundly based on productivity or arises from transitory surges in output financed in many cases by excess credit, but this is in part what making monetary policy is all about.",1997-05-08
"In that regard and in the current context, how can we be confident we at the Federal Reserve are not inhibiting the nation reaching its full growth potential?",1997-05-08
"Only two and a half years ago, rising commodity prices, lengthening delivery times, and heavy overtime indicated that our productive facilities were under some strain to meet demand.",1997-05-08
"However, given the good pace of economic expansion since then, it would stretch credulity to believe that capacity growth has accelerated at a sufficient pace to produce a large degree of slack at this moment.",1997-05-08
"However, falling unemployment rates and rising overtime hours--as well as anecdotal reports--unambiguously point to growing tightness in labor markets.",1997-05-08
"With tight labor markets and little slack in product markets, we are led to conclude that significant persistent strength in the growth of nominal demand for goods and services, outstripping the likely rate of increase in capacity, will presumably be resisted by higher market interest rates.",1997-05-08
"If, instead, that demand is accommodated for a time by a step up in credit expansion facilitated by monetary policy, increasing pressures on productive resources would sow, as they have in the past, the seeds of even higher interest rates and a consequent subsequent economic retrenchment.",1997-05-08
"We saw a significant risk that monetary policy was not positioned to promote sustainable economic expansion, and we took a small step to increase the odds that the good performance of the economy can continue.",1997-05-08
"It is the notion that, owing largely to technological advance and to freer international trade, the conventional notions of capacity are becoming increasingly outmoded, and that domestic resources can be used much more intensively than in the past without added price pressures.",1997-05-08
"This has imparted a substantially increased degree of flexibility into the workplace, which in conjunction with just-in-time inventory strategies and increased availability of products from around the world, has kept costs in check through increased productivity.",1997-05-08
"If we consider the current rate of true, sustainable growth unsatisfactory, are there policies which could augment it?",1997-05-08
"In my view, improving productivity and standards of living necessitates increasing incentives to risk taking.",1997-05-08
"Maintaining low inflation rates reduces the levels of future uncertainties and, hence, increases the scope of investment opportunities.",1997-05-08
It is here that the Federal Reserve can most contribute to long-term growth.,1997-05-08
"In addition, coming to grips now with the outsized projected growth in entitlement spending in the early years of the next century could have a profound effect on current expectations of stability.",1997-05-08
"Early actions could bring real long-term interest rates down, also increasing the scope of investment opportunities.",1997-05-08
"And, clearly, removing the federal deficit’s drain on private savings would help to finance such private investment.",1997-05-08
"Deregulation, by increasing the flexibility in the deployment of our capital and management resources, can also make a decided contribution to growth.",1997-05-08
"Finally, though not a function of government policies, is the continued good pace of productivity growth this late in the business expansion.",1997-05-08
"If so, it is important that we nurture it with adequate incentives--at a minimum, eschew regulations and taxation that reduce most incentives--for this may well be one source of our low inflation environment.",1997-05-08
"While productivity improvement through capital investment and technological advance is clearly central to the process of economic growth, the pace and quality of labor force expansion is additive to productivity growth in achieving overall gains in GDP.",1997-05-08
"Hence, appropriate upgrading of skills through education and training should go with any menu to expand economic growth.",1997-05-08
"For a vast nation such as ours at the cutting edge of technology, a large pickup in productivity growth is difficult to envisage.",1997-05-08
But appropriate incentives advancing that cutting edge can augment growth in a material way.,1997-05-08
"Central bankers, in particular, are going to have to be able to ascertain how changes in the balance sheets of economic actors influence real economic activity and, hence, affect appropriate macroeconomic policies.",1999-08-27
"This morning, I plan to address some of the problems that arise in evaluating the prices of equities.",1999-08-27
"But a substantial portion of software spending is expensed, even though the equity prices of the purchasing companies are clearly valuing the software outlays as contributing to earnings over their useful economic lives--the relevant criterion for capitalizing an asset.",1999-08-27
"In general, if the trend of expensed items that should be capitalized is rising faster than reported earnings, switching to capitalizing these items will almost always accelerate the growth in earnings.",1999-08-27
"But the newer technologies, and the productivity and bull stock market they have fostered, are also accentuating some accounting difficulties that tend to bias up reported earnings.",1999-08-27
"This distortion, all else equal, has overstated growth of reported profits according to Fed staff calculations by one to two percentage points annually during the past five years.",1999-08-27
"Similarly, the rise in stock prices, which reduces corporate contributions to pension funds is also augmenting reported profits.",1999-08-27
"These upward adjustments in reported earnings, of course, are a consequence of rising stock prices and, hence, may not be of the same dimension in the future.",1999-08-27
"It does not seem likely, however, even should all of the appropriate accounting adjustments to earnings be made, that such adjustments can be the central explanation of the extraordinary increase in stock prices over the past five years.",1999-08-27
"Even our most sophisticated analytic techniques have difficulty dealing with the interactions among time preference, risk aversion, and uncertainty and with the implications of these interactions for the risk premiums that are embedded in asset prices.",1999-08-27
"As model builders know, all economic channels of influence are not of equal power to engender growth or contraction.",1999-08-27
"The translation of value judgments into market prices is, of course, rooted in how people discount uncertain future outcomes.",1999-08-27
"One of the most enduring is that interest rates, as far back as we can measure, appear trendless, despite vast changes in technology, life expectancy, and economic organization.",1999-08-27
"British long-term government interest rates, for example, mostly ranged between three percent and six percent from the early eighteenth century to the early twentieth century, and are around five percent today.",1999-08-27
"Indeed, scattered evidence dating back to ancient Rome and before reflects the same order of interest rate magnitude, not a one percent interest rate nor 200 percent.",1999-08-27
"This suggests that the rate of time preference underlying interest rates, like so many other aspects of human nature, has not materially changed over the generations.",1999-08-27
And attempts to disengage from markets that are net long--the most general case--means bids are hit and prices fall.,1999-08-27
"Modern quantitative approaches to risk measurement and risk management take as their starting point historical experience with market price fluctuations, which is statistically summarized in probability distributions.",1999-08-27
"Whether Dutch tulip bulbs or Russian equities, the market price patterns remain much the same.",1999-08-27
"To anticipate a bubble about to burst requires the forecast of a plunge in the prices of assets previously set by the judgments of millions of investors, many of whom are highly knowledgeable about the prospects for the specific companies that make up our broad stock price indexes.",1999-08-27
"If episodic recurrences of ruptured confidence are integral to the way our economy and our financial markets work now and in the future, it has significant implications for risk management and, by implication, macroeconomic modeling and monetary policy.",1999-08-27
"Probability distributions that are estimated largely, or exclusively, over cycles excluding periods of panic will underestimate the probability of extreme price movements because they fail to capture a secondary peak at the extreme negative tail that reflects the probability of occurrence of a panic.",1999-08-27
"Efforts to differentiate between realized and unrealized gains, and the propensity to leverage both, may afford a deeper understanding of the consequences of asset price change.",1999-08-27
"Finally, in the business sector, questions remain about the influence of equity prices on investment spending.",1999-08-27
"In particular, Do all equity price movements--whether related to fundamentals or not--have the same effect on investment spending?",1999-08-27
"In conclusion, the issues that I have touched on this morning are of increasing importance for monetary policy.",1999-08-27
"We no longer have the luxury to look primarily to the flow of goods and services, as conventionally estimated, when evaluating the macroeconomic environment in which monetary policy must function.",1999-08-27
There are important--but extremely difficult--questions surrounding the behavior of asset prices and the implications of this behavior for the decisions of households and businesses.,1999-08-27
"Consequently, while any monetary policy decision has implications for achieving maximum employment, and I will address those implications in a moment, the FOMC is now, and must be, utterly focused on moving inflation down toward our 2 percent target.",2022-07-14
"We must be focused on reducing inflation because, despite a lot of talk about recession lately, the evidence from the labor market indicates the economy is on track, while inflation continues to be far too high.",2022-07-14
"It must be our focus because high inflation is the biggest challenge to sustaining our employment goal, and the greatest burden for individuals and families, especially lower- and moderate-income households that dedicate a larger share of their spending to necessities.",2022-07-14
"Inflation has to be our focus, every meeting and every day, because the spending and pricing decisions people and businesses make every day depend on their expectations of future inflation, which in turn depend on whether they believe the Fed is sufficiently committed to its inflation target.",2022-07-14
"So let me be clear: I am going to vote to set policy in a manner that will reduce inflation and achieve our price stability goal, and today I will explain why I don't see that progress conflicting with our maximum-employment goal.",2022-07-14
"Let me start with my view of the labor market and inflation, then turn to the implications for monetary policy, and conclude with where I think the economy is headed.",2022-07-14
That isn't a picture of a weakening job market.,2022-07-14
The unemployment rate in June was steady at 3.6 percent.,2022-07-14
"It is often said that this is ""close to a half-century low"" and that is true, but you really have to go back 69 years, to 1953, to find the unemployment rate more than a couple tenths of a point lower than it was in June.",2022-07-14
This is about as good a job market as any worker has ever seen.,2022-07-14
"As a share of the labor force, weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance are near record lows and have been fairly steady all year.",2022-07-14
"Turning to GDP, there are signs of slowing in economic activity.",2022-07-14
"The Commerce Department estimates that there was a modest contraction in real GDP for the first quarter of the year, and ""nowcasting"" projections of economic activity, such as the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracker, foresee a similar contraction in the second quarter.6 There is also softness in recent spending data, which has been widespread across consumer spending, business investment, housing, and government purchases, as well as some weaker indicators for the manufacturing sector and a deterioration in consumer sentiment, which by some measures are at historically low levels.",2022-07-14
"But I don't see how that squares with the job creation data, the low unemployment rate, and overall strong labor market that I described earlier.",2022-07-14
"Past experience has shown that job creation and the unemployment rate are timely indicators of a recession, more timely than quarterly GDP.",2022-07-14
Persistently High Inflation Now let's talk about inflation.,2022-07-14
Yesterday's report on the consumer price index (CPI) for June was a major league disappointment.,2022-07-14
"On a twelve-month basis, total inflation stood at 9.1 percent, the highest in 40 years.",2022-07-14
"No matter how you look at the data, inflation is far too high and my job is to move it down toward our 2 percent target.",2022-07-14
"We know that supply shortages and bottlenecks, including the tight labor market, have contributed to the high inflation readings we are observing.",2022-07-14
"We also know that the surge in demand during the pandemic that was driven by excess saving, significant fiscal stimulus, and accommodative monetary policy also has contributed to the high inflation we are now experiencing.",2022-07-14
There is some research estimating how much of this inflation came from supply problems and how much from high demand.7 The main point is that both played a large part in driving the inflation that we have seen over the past year.,2022-07-14
"But the causes of inflation don't affect my approach to policy because in writing the FOMC's mandate, Congress did not say ""Your goal is price stability unless inflation is caused by supply shocks, in which case you are off the hook.""",2022-07-14
"We want to reduce excessive inflation, whatever the source, in part because whether it comes from supply or demand, high inflation can push up longer-run inflation expectations and thus affect spending and pricing decisions in the near term.",2022-07-14
These decisions can then push up prices even more and make inflation harder to get under control.,2022-07-14
I pay attention to both surveys of the public's inflation expectations and measures of inflation expectations derived from trading of inflation-indexed securities.,2022-07-14
"The Board staff combines various surveys and market-based measures in our Index of Common Inflation Expectations, which has moved up slightly in recent months after being flat for a long time.",2022-07-14
We need to avoid expectations rising so much that they become a factor that drives inflation higher.,2022-07-14
"The Path of Monetary Policy So, based on persistently high inflation and the very tight labor market that I have described, let's talk about the implications for monetary policy.",2022-07-14
That size increase was not an over-reaction to one data point on inflationâ€”it was primarily the response to a sequence of excessively high inflation readings since the beginning of the year.,2022-07-14
It was appropriate given the lack of progress on inflation and clearly signals the FOMC's commitment to get inflation under control as soon as possible.,2022-07-14
The response of financial markets to the FOMC's policy actions and communications indicate to me that the Committee retains the credibility and the public confidence that is needed to make monetary policy effective.,2022-07-14
"Longer-term interest rates have moved up to levels not far from those reflected in Committee members' estimates of the final destination for the federal funds rate in this tightening cycle, effectively implementing policy ahead of time.",2022-07-14
"While there is some slowdown in home sales, lenders and borrowers are still doing business at these rates, which indicates that they believe the FOMC's policy intentions are credible, as broadly reflected in the interest rate paths in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).",2022-07-14
"As I have said before, with inflation so high, there is a virtue in front-loading tightening so that policy moves as soon as is practical to a setting that restricts demand.",2022-07-14
Getting there sooner will bolster the public's confidence that we can get inflation down and it will preserve options for adjusting the pace of tightening later if needed.,2022-07-14
"I judge that level is close to neutral, by which I mean a level that neither stimulates nor restricts demand, assuming that the economy is growing moderately (at its potential) and unemployment is roughly where it is now.",2022-07-14
If that data come in materially stronger than expected it would make me lean towards a larger hike at the July meeting to the extent it shows demand is not slowing down fast enough to get inflation down.,2022-07-14
"Based on what we know about inflation today, I expect that further increases in the target range will be needed to make monetary policy restrictive, but that will depend on economic data in the coming weeks and months.",2022-07-14
"Between the end of July and the FOMC's September meeting, we will get two employment and CPI reports with data for July and August.",2022-07-14
I will be looking for signs that inflation has started its move down toward our 2 percent target on a sustained basis.,2022-07-14
"I anticipate a decline in inflation will come as actual and anticipated hikes by the FOMC cool demand for products and labor, which will help demand and supply come into a better balance.",2022-07-14
"The decline in the rate of inflation will also be assisted by continued improvement in goods supply bottlenecks, which is occurring in some sectors, and an increase in labor force participation, which is still significantly lower than it was before the pandemic.",2022-07-14
"After the July meeting, further increases will be restricting demand.",2022-07-14
"Looking further in the future, I will need to see how the tightening this year is affecting the economy and bringing inflation down toward our 2 percent target.",2022-07-14
"Based on my forecast for the economy, I expect monetary policy to be restrictive until there has been a sustained reduction in core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation, which excludes food and energy.",2022-07-14
"Food and energy prices tend to be volatile, so focusing on core PCE inflation is a good guide to inflation pressures in the near and medium term.",2022-07-14
"Importantly, as futures prices for commoditiesâ€”food, energy, raw materialsâ€”have declined recently, I am expecting total PCE inflation to decline in coming months.",2022-07-14
"But until I see a significant moderation in core prices, I support further rate hikes.",2022-07-14
"In talking about where monetary policy is headed, it is helpful to get a fix on where it is right now.",2022-07-14
"I mentioned the concept of a ""neutral"" interest rate, and the belief that the federal funds rate will be close to neutral after another 75-basis point increase at the end of this month.",2022-07-14
"But some would argue that monetary policy is actually further away from neutral, based on the fact that current inflation is so much higher than the federal funds rate.",2022-07-14
"In my view, that rests on a flawed idea of how monetary policy affects spending decisions.",2022-07-14
"This means taking into consideration longer-term real rates, which are tied to the expected path of policy and inflation over the next several years.",2022-07-14
"Based on trading in inflation-indexed Treasury securities of different maturities (compared to nominal Treasury securities), investors see federal funds rates above expected inflation starting about six months from now and steepening thereafter.",2022-07-14
This gives me some confidence that tightening now anticipated by markets and expected by FOMC participants will be sufficient to reduce demand and inflation.,2022-07-14
Evolution of the Economy The FOMC's plan for getting inflation under control depends on a view of the economic outlook.,2022-07-14
"With a policy path like what I described for this year and a bit more tightening next year, the median SEP respondent projected that total PCE inflation is expected to fall from its current elevated level today to 2.2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2024.",2022-07-14
"At the same time, the unemployment rate is projected to rise to 3.7 percent at the end of this year and to 4.1 percent by the end of 2024, while GDP would grow below its long-run trend for the next two years.",2022-07-14
I say this based on the optimistic view I expressed earlier about the strength of the labor market and on my analysis of the relationship between job vacancies and the unemployment rate.,2022-07-14
"In a recent speech, I noted that we have an historically high number of job vacancies compared to the number of unemployed people.9 Some people have argued that past experience indicates we cannot reduce this large number of vacancies without a big increase in the unemployment rate.",2022-07-14
"But I have showed that past experience actually indicates that a reduction in vacancies can take place without a big loss of employment, and this is the kind of soft landing anticipated by FOMC participants.",2022-07-14
"However, for the reasons I have laid out, and considering the evidence on the state of the economy and the outlook, I don't find it difficult to reaffirm my strong conviction that continued policy tightening will be appropriate to move inflation down toward our 2 percent target.",2022-07-14

"May 05, 2021 The Economic Outlook and Implications for Monetary Policy Governor Michelle W. Bowman At The Colorado Forum, Denver, Colorado (via webcast) Share Thank you for this opportunity to address the members of the Colorado Forum, which has been an arena for thoughtful discussion and debate for more than 40 years.",2021-05-05
"As we all know, starting in late February or March of last year, widespread economic and social lockdowns and other effects of the pandemic caused the swiftest and deepest contraction in employment and economic activity since the Great Depression.",2021-05-05
We also cut short-term interest rates to near zero and began purchasing large quantities of Treasury and agency securities to help sustain the flow of credit to households and businesses.,2021-05-05
"Calm was restored in financial markets, and employment and output began growing in May, but it was a very deep hole to fill.",2021-05-05
"Rapid progress last summer gave way to slower economic growth over the turn of the year, as infection rates once again surged.",2021-05-05
"Recently, the incoming data indicate that economic activity is on an upswing, and the risks of more negative outcomesâ€”especially those from COVID-19â€”appear to be easing.",2021-05-05
"In the job market, job gains rebounded to 916,000 in March.",2021-05-05
"Likewise, the FOMC median in March was for unemployment to fall to 4.5 percent at the end of 2021, and now it seems possible that it may fall even further.",2021-05-05
I would be interested to hear from this group about how businesses in Colorado have been faring and whether they have seen an improvement in demand as the pandemic conditions are easing.,2021-05-05
"Likewise, economic growth rebounded much more quickly than many had expected, but then slowed late in 2020 before regaining speed following the availability of the vaccine.",2021-05-05
"The economic recovery is not yet complete, and the uncertain course of the pandemic still presents risks in the near term, which is why my colleagues and I on the FOMC decided last week to maintain our highly accommodative stance of monetary policy.",2021-05-05
"Despite the progress to date and the signs of acceleration in the recovery, employment is still considerably short of where it was when the pandemic disrupted the economy and it is well below where it should be, considering the pre-pandemic trend.",2021-05-05
"In particular, our maximum employment mandate is intended as a broad and inclusive goal increasing employment and opportunity, but I remain concerned that employment gains for some minority groups have lagged behind those of others.",2021-05-05
"We are making good progress toward our full employment goal, but we still have a long way to go, and risks remain.",2021-05-05
"Over the next several months, I expect that headline inflation measures will move above our long-run target of 2 percent.",2021-05-05
A main reason I expect this outcome is simply the fact that the very low inflation readings during last spring's deep economic contraction will drop from the usual calculation of 12-month price changes.,2021-05-05
"But in addition, the unusually rapid rebound in economic activity that we've seen, along with the pandemic-driven shift towards goods purchases, has led to supply-chain bottlenecks in a number of areas, which in turn have pushed up prices for many goods.",2021-05-05
One prominent example is with semiconductor producers and their need to dramatically alter the mix of production to meet demands of the high-tech and automotive industries.,2021-05-05
"Although I expect these upward price pressures to ease after the temporary supply bottlenecks are resolved, the exact timing of that dynamic is uncertain.",2021-05-05
"If the supply bottlenecks prove to be more long-lasting than currently expected, I will adjust my views on the inflation outlook accordingly.",2021-05-05
"At this point, the risk that inflation remains persistently above our long-run target of 2 percent still appears small.",2021-05-05

"October 19, 2020 U.S. Economic Outlook, Monetary Policy, and Initiatives to Sustain the Flow of Credit to Households and Firms Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the Unconventional Convention of the American Bankers Association, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share It is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today at the Unconventional Convention of the American Bankers Association.1 I look forward to my conversation with Rob Nichols, but first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and some of the initiatives we have announced to support the flow of credit to households and firms during these challenging times.",2020-10-19
"The flow of macrodata received since May has been surprisingly strong, and GDP growth in the third quarter is estimated by many forecasters to have rebounded at roughly a 30 percent annual rate.",2020-10-19
This development is especially noteworthy when set in relief against the surge in new COVID-19 cases that were reported this summer in a number of U.S. states and the coincident flatlining in a number of high-frequency activity indicators that we follow to track the effect of the virus on economic activity.,2020-10-19
These components of aggregate demand have benefited from robust fiscal supportâ€”including expanded unemployment benefits and the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)â€”as well as low interest rates and efforts by the Federal Reserve to sustain the flow of credit to households and firms.,2020-10-19
"In the labor market, about half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in the spring have been restored, and the unemployment rate has fallen since April by nearly 7 percentage points to 7.9 percent as of September.",2020-10-19
It will likely take even longer than that for the unemployment rate to return to a level consistent with our maximum-employment mandate.,2020-10-19
"However, it is worth highlighting that the Committee's baseline projections summarized in the most recent Summary of Economic Projections foresee a relatively rapid return to mandate-consistent levels of employment and inflation as compared with the recovery from the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).2 In particular, the median Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participant projects that by the end of 2023â€”a little more than three years from nowâ€”the unemployment rate will have fallen to 4 percent, and PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation will have returned to 2 percent.",2020-10-19
"Following the GFC, it took more than eight years for employment and inflation to return to similar mandate-consistent levels.",2020-10-19
"We indicated that, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, our policy will aim to achieve inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal.",2020-10-19
"We said that we expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomesâ€”as well as our maximum-employment mandateâ€”are achieved, and also that we expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.",2020-10-19
"Concluding Remarks While recovery since the spring collapse in economic activity has been robust, let us not forget that the full economic recovery from the COVID-19 recession has a long way to go, with the unemployment rate still elevated at 7.9 percent as of September and inflation still running below our 2 percent longer-run objective.",2020-10-19
"It will take some time to return to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the business cycle peak in February, and additional support from monetaryâ€”and likely fiscalâ€”policy will be needed.",2020-10-19

"May 16, 2007 Globalization and Capital Markets: Implications for Inflation and the Yield Curve Governor Randall S. Kroszner At the Center for Financial Stability (CEF), Buenos Aires, Argentina Share I am delighted to be back in Argentina.",2007-05-16
"Inflation rates and interest rates are at historically low levels, and yield curves are relatively flat nearly everywhere.",2007-05-16
"I believe that the taming of inflation and the improved credibility of monetary policy have been crucial to the deepening of domestic capital markets, which is typically associated with higher economic growth.",2007-05-16
"I will explore some possible explanations for these developments, focusing on the prospects for, and risks to, the long-term inflation outlook, particularly in emerging-market economies.",2007-05-16
"Before I continue, please note that the opinions I express here today are my own and not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.1 In brief, I argue that globalization, deregulation, and financial innovation, in part spurred by the experiences of high inflation in the 1980s, have fostered currency competition that has led to improved central bank performance and, hence, the recent reduction of worldwide inflation.",2007-05-16
The increased competition among currencies has changed the ability and the incentives of governments and central banks to pursue high-inflation policies.,2007-05-16
"Such changes have allowed improvements in central bank governance and credibility, thereby leading to better inflation outcomes, especially in many emerging-market economies.",2007-05-16
"In addition, greater central bank credibility has allowed the development of long-term bond markets in many countries and flattened yield curves around the globe as concerns about future inflation risks have declined.",2007-05-16
The important issue is whether the reduction of worldwide inflation will persist or be a temporary phenomenon.,2007-05-16
"The Worldwide Decline in Inflation From the 1950s until the late 1960s, inflation rates were relatively contained, and episodes of high inflation were rare.",2007-05-16
"Then, especially following the early-1970s collapse of the Bretton Woods fixed-exchange-rate system, inflation became a worldwide phenomenon.",2007-05-16
"Even in Germany, which had the most stable prices of any country in the world, inflation eroded purchasing power by more than half between 1972 and the launch of the euro, in 1999.",2007-05-16
"In terms of cumulative inflation, $480 would be required today in the United States to purchase $100 worth of goods and services at 1972 prices.",2007-05-16
"For most countries reporting data to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), cumulative inflation has been even higher than that experienced in the United States.",2007-05-16
"Here in Argentina, the price level is now about 177 billion times higher than it was in 1972.",2007-05-16
"But Brazil takes the prize for greatest inflation of the post-World War II era: The price level in Brazil is approximately 500 billion times higher today than it was in 1972.3 Since the early 1990s, however, worldwide inflation has significantly declined.",2007-05-16
"Indeed, the April 2006 issue of the IMF's World Economic Outlook shows that, on average, inflation rates in the advanced economies as well as in the developing countries in recent years have been at their lowest levels since at least the early 1970s.",2007-05-16
The April 2007 issue forecasts inflation in both regions to remain near these recent lows through 2008.,2007-05-16
But is this lower inflation regime likely to persist?,2007-05-16
One way to approach this issue is to investigate what market participants think by examining measures of expected inflation.,2007-05-16
"Overall, these surveys suggest that market participants do expect relatively low inflation to continue in most major industrial and emerging-market countries.",2007-05-16
"In the industrial countries and a few Asian emerging-market economies, for example, long-term inflation expectations dropped below 5 percent a decade or more ago and are currently around 2 percent to 3 percent.4 In Brazil and Mexico, long-term inflation expectations have declined from a range of 7 percent to 10 percent a decade ago to a fairly steady 3 percent to 4 percent in recent years.",2007-05-16
"In Argentina, long-term inflation expectations are around 7 percent.",2007-05-16
"In addition, the risks of high inflation appear to have decreased as well.",2007-05-16
"In particular, the volatility of inflation has declined notably, especially in many emerging- market countries.5 On occasion in the early to middle 1990s, the standard deviation of inflation exceeded 30 percent in Mexico and 100 percent in Argentina and Brazil.",2007-05-16
"In the current decade, however, the standard deviation of inflation has been relatively stable in Brazil, at around 5 percent, and it has been declining in Mexico, where it is now around 2 percent.",2007-05-16
"In Argentina, inflation volatility is currently around 15 percent.",2007-05-16
"Factors Behind the Taming of Worldwide Inflation My brief review of worldwide inflation performance suggests that in general, over the past decade, inflation has become substantially lower and less volatile, and expectations of future inflation have also become substantially lower.",2007-05-16
"In understanding the key factors behind this change, we can also shed further light on the question of whether this low-inflation regime will persist.",2007-05-16
"In a nutshell, I believe that the factors of globalization, deregulation, and financial innovation, arising partly in response to episodes of high inflation, have effectively eroded the central bank monopoly on the provision of monetary services and have enhanced global competition among currencies.",2007-05-16
"The resulting constraint on monetary policy, combined with increased public understanding of the costs of inflation, have led to institutional changes in central bank governance that bolster their credibility for maintaining price stability in the future.",2007-05-16
"To develop this explanation in more detail, I will start by describing how globalization, deregulation, and innovation can alter the ability and incentives of a government to pursue a high-inflation policy.6 These factors are closely related and mutually reinforcing in many respects.",2007-05-16
Many countries have turned increasingly to private markets and trade to deliver growth and progress.,2007-05-16
How does this affect inflation?,2007-05-16
"When governments resort to printing money to finance their spending, inflation rises and nominal assets lose their value.",2007-05-16
This loss of value is also known as the inflation tax.,2007-05-16
"Globalization, deregulation, and innovation make it easier for citizens to move their wealth out of nominal assets in the domestic currency should their government resort to an inflation tax.",2007-05-16
"When the tax base shrinks in response to inflation, governments have a reduced incentive to resort to the inflation tax.",2007-05-16
Increased circulation of banknotes in dollars or other hard currencies enable citizens to conduct transactions and store liquid wealth without holding inflationary currency.,2007-05-16
"The fraction of U.S. currency estimated to be held in foreign countries rose dramatically over the 1980s and 1990s, from less than 20 percent to about 60 percent, and it has remained near this high level even as inflation rates have come down globally.",2007-05-16
"Substantial financial innovations--including advances in electronic payment and trading systems as well as more widespread credit card networks and increased use of mutual funds--have enabled consumers, investors, and banks to shift wealth cheaply and quickly away from currencies and assets subject to inflation and related risks.",2007-05-16
"Given the stronger competition among currencies, a government that pressures a central bank to pursue an inflationary policy gets much less benefit from increased inflation because people can more rapidly and conveniently switch out of the domestic currency.",2007-05-16
"Indeed, the website of the Central Bank of Brazil explicitly acknowledges the role of inflation in driving financial innovations that enabled firms and households to economize on cash balances in that country.",2007-05-16
"It states that, ""Prior to the mid-1990s [when inflation was stabilized], changes in the payment system in Brazil were motivated by the need to cope with high inflation rates.",2007-05-16
"7 In addition to encouraging financial innovation, the painful experience of high inflation helped to educate the public and economists about the costs of inflation.8 Although the specific experiences differed across countries, public opinion almost everywhere eventually reinforced the trend against inflationary policies.",2007-05-16
"Economists and central bankers also devoted great attention to understanding the causes and consequences of inflation, providing the intellectual underpinning to policies oriented toward price stability.",2007-05-16
"The fundamental forces I have described today--globalization, deregulation, financial innovation, and public understanding about the costs of inflation--provided the impetus for fighting inflation and opened the path for policies that enhance central bank credibility.",2007-05-16
"As the benefits of stable prices accrue and as financial markets deepen and become more sophisticated, the benefits of sound economic policies will help create support for institutional reforms that make returning to inflation harder--albeit not impossible--for future governments.",2007-05-16
Implications of Low Inflation for Bond Markets What are the implications of low inflation and low inflation volatility for interest rates and yield curves?,2007-05-16
I believe that market confidence in continued low inflation has helped drive down the slope of the yield curve around the world by reducing the premium demanded for holding long-term nominal assets.,2007-05-16
"The taming of inflation also has extended bond maturities and yield curves further into the future than ever before, most notably in many emerging-market countries.",2007-05-16
"The current low level of long-term yields in the United States and other advanced economies is widely acknowledged as somewhat of a puzzle, or, as some have called it, a conundrum.9 Of course, flat and even inverted yield curves in advanced economies are nothing new--we know that the short end of the yield curve is dominated by monetary policy and cyclical factors.",2007-05-16
"The forward rate reflects not only the market expectation of the future short-term interest rate but also a ""term premium"" to compensate for the risk of a commitment to extend credit so far in the future, including the risk of future inflation.",2007-05-16
"Chairman Bernanke has suggested that an excess of ex ante global saving relative to global investment has held down real interest rates around the world.11 Some of the factors behind this excess of saving over investment include the surge in revenues of oil and commodity exporters, a retreat in Asian investment demand from the boom that preceded the late 1990s, and a reduction in fiscal deficits in some Latin American countries.",2007-05-16
"The declines in inflation rates, in the volatility of inflation, and in long-term inflation expectations all point to a reduction in the compensation required by investors for the effects of future inflation on the returns to holding long-term bonds.",2007-05-16
"This development is particularly remarkable in many emerging-market countries, in which longer-dated fixed-coupon bonds issued in domestic currencies had ceased to exist during the inflationary 1970s and 1980s.",2007-05-16
"The recent lengthening of maturities of domestic-currency debt has, in many cases, not only extended the yield curve but--and this is one of the key results of the taming of inflation--effectively created a domestic-currency yield curve that previously did not exist.",2007-05-16
"Besides the fact that yield curves have been extended in many countries, they have also been relatively low and flat worldwide, at least in part because of the decline in inflation.",2007-05-16
"Overall, the combination of lower and less volatile inflation worldwide has reduced inflation expectations and perceived inflation risk and resulted in a lower premium in long rates for inflation uncertainty.",2007-05-16
The establishment of markets for long-term nominal government and corporate debt in countries in which they did not exist a decade ago is powerful evidence of the faith that investors place in a future environment of price stability.,2007-05-16
Broader Economic Benefits The economic benefits of price stability are too numerous and well known for me to cover here in detail.,2007-05-16
Long-run price stability certainly is essential for achieving maximum employment.,2007-05-16
Price stability boosts growth by deepening financial markets.,2007-05-16
"Given stable prices, savers and investors have more confidence about the ultimate value of their investments and are more willing to enter long-term financial contracts.",2007-05-16
A number of studies have concluded that the development of banking and financial markets is a key driver of economic growth.,2007-05-16
"When emerging-market countries borrowed mostly in dollars or other foreign currency, they bore the exchange rate risk while lenders bore default risk.",2007-05-16
This was a key reason why currency crises of the past few decades were so costly: Sharp depreciations of the exchange rate boosted the domestic-currency value of foreign debt and wreaked havoc with government finances and corporate balance sheets.,2007-05-16
Higher and more-stable growth combined with a better ability to undertake long-term plans can also improve the fiscal outlook for a country.,2007-05-16
"A better fiscal outlook, in turn, increases confidence, facilitates financial market development, and thus further boosts growth.",2007-05-16
"And, in a virtuous cycle, it reinforces prospects for continued price stability.",2007-05-16
"More-prudent fiscal policies, including lower deficits, longer debt maturities, and reduced foreign-currency debt can reduce the likelihood and potential severity of financial crises.",2007-05-16
These policies make the financial positions of emerging-market governments less vulnerable to movements in interest rates and exchange rates.,2007-05-16
"Maintaining Progress I have argued that globalization, deregulation, and financial innovation, in part spurred by recent experiences of high inflation, have fostered currency competition that has led to improved central bank performance and, hence, the reduction of inflation worldwide.",2007-05-16
"Barriers to the free flow of goods, services, capital, and technology would also diminish the force of innovation that has been so beneficial in the struggle against inflation.",2007-05-16
"High inflation can destroy an economy and result in enormous hardship for everyone involved, as Argentina painfully experienced not long ago.",2007-05-16
The benefits achieved through more-stable prices are substantial.,2007-05-16
I would like to stress that I will not be addressing the immediate economic outlook or the recent conduct of monetary policy.,2006-07-18
"Despite some recent turbulence, owing in part to geopolitical events, stock prices have logged robust gains over the past 3-1/2 years, and broad equity indices have now retraced most of the ground lost between 2000 and 2002.",2006-07-18
"Moreover, the resulting robust gains in labor productivity have been well ahead of compensation growth and have dramatically boosted corporate profits.",2006-07-18
"However, in this framework, the current period appears to be an outlier.4 That is, even after factoring in the current-cycle dynamics of strong profit growth and relatively modest investment, a good part of the rise in liquid assets remains unaccounted for--as much as one half of the total rise in cash-to-assets--according to Federal Reserve staff estimates.",2006-07-18
"Business Caution As I discussed earlier, regression analysis suggests that the robust growth in profits and the comparatively modest recovery in capital expenditures leaves a good part of the extraordinary cash buildup unexplained.",2006-07-18
"Although many periods of recovery are accompanied by concerns of economic growth and political turmoil, surveys in 2002 and 2003 suggested that business leaders were experiencing a more prolonged sense of gloom, with measures of sentiment dropping to low levels for as long two years beyond the trough in the business cycle.",2006-07-18
"These reversals can be attributed, in part, to the resurgence of share repurchases, the growth in dividend payouts, cashâ€“financed merger activity, and a pickup in capital investment.",2006-07-18
"Not surprisingly, outlays on structures used in energy production strengthened in response to higher energy prices, but the rise in the first quarter also reflected an increase for office, retail, and industrial structures.",2006-07-18

"First, I will discuss the factors that motivated the Federal Reserve in November 2018 to announce it would undertake in 2019 the first-ever public review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices.",2020-08-31
"Third, I will briefly summarize the flexible inflation-targeting strategy that has been guiding U.S. monetary policy since 2012 in the context of some important changes in the economic landscape that have become evident since 2012.",2020-08-31
"Fourth, I will discuss the major findings of the review as codified in our new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy and highlight some important policy implications that flow from them.",2020-08-31
"Indeed, I would argue that over the past eight years, the framework served us well and supported the Federal Reserve's efforts after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) first to achieve and then, for several years, to sustainâ€”until cut short this spring by the COVID-19 pandemicâ€”the operation of the economy at or close to both our statutorily assigned goals of maximum employment and price stability in what became the longest economic expansion in U.S. history.",2020-08-31
"Nonetheless, both the U.S. economyâ€”and, equally importantly, our understanding of the economyâ€”have clearly evolved along several crucial dimensions since 2012, and we believed that in 2019 it made sense to step back and assess whether, and in what possible ways, we might refine and rethink our strategy, tools, and communication practices to achieve and sustain our goals as consistently and robustly as possible in the global economy in which we operate today and for the foreseeable future.3 Perhaps the most significant change since 2012 in our understanding of the economy is our reassessment of the neutral real interest rate, r*, that, over the longer run, is consistent with our maximum-employment and price-stability mandates.",2020-08-31
"In January 2012, the median FOMC participant projected a long-run r* of 2.25 percent, which, in tandem with the inflation goal of 2 percent, indicated a neutral setting for the federal funds rate of 4.25 percent.",2020-08-31
"Moreover, as is well appreciated, the decline in neutral policy rates since the GFC is a global phenomenon that is widely expected by forecasters and financial markets to persist for years to come.5 The substantial decline in the neutral policy rate since 2012 has critical implications for the design, implementation, and communication of Federal Reserve monetary policy because it leaves the FOMC with less conventional policy space to cut rates to offset adverse shocks to aggregate demand.",2020-08-31
"With a diminished reservoir of conventional policy space, it is much more likely than was appreciated in 2012 that, in economic downturns, the effective lower bound (ELB) will constrain the ability of the FOMC to rely solely on the federal funds rate instrument to offset adverse shocks.6 This development, in turn, makes it more likely that recessions will impart elevated risks of more persistent downward pressure on inflation and upward pressure on unemployment that the Federal Reserve's monetary policy should, in design and implementation, seek to offset throughout the business cycle and not just in downturns themselves.7 Two other, related developments that have also become more evident than they appeared in 2012 are that price inflation seems less responsive to resource slack, and also, that estimates of resource slack based on historically estimated price Phillips curve relationships are less reliable and subject to more material revision than was once commonly believed.8 For example, in the face of declining unemployment rates that did not result in excessive cost-push pressure to price inflation, the median of the Committee's projections of u*â€”the rate of unemployment consistent in the longer run with the 2 percent inflation objectiveâ€”has been repeatedly revised lower, from 5.5 percent in January 2012 to 4.1 percent as of the June 2020 SEP.9 Projections of u* by the Congressional Budget Office and professional forecasters show a similar decline during this same period and for the same reason.10 In the past several years of the previous expansion, declines in the unemployment rate occurred in tandem with a notable and, to me, welcome increase in real wages that was accompanied by an increase in labor's share of national income, but not a surge in price inflation to a pace inconsistent with our price-stability mandate and well-anchored inflation expectations.",2020-08-31
"Indeed, this pattern of mid-cycle declines in unemployment coincident with noninflationary increases in real wages has been evident in the U.S. data since the 1990s.11 With regard to inflation expectations, there is broad agreement among academics and policymakers that achieving price stability on a sustainable basis requires that inflation expectations be well anchored at the rate of inflation consistent with the price-stability goal.",2020-08-31
"This is especially true in the world that prevails today, with flat Phillips curves in which the primary determinant of actual inflation is expected inflation.12 The pre-GFC academic literature derived the important result that a credible inflation-targeting monetary policy strategy that is not constrained by the ELB can deliver, under rational expectations, inflation expectations that themselves are well anchored at the inflation target.13 In other words, absent a binding ELB constraint, a policy that targets actual inflation in these models delivers long-run inflation expectations well anchored at the target ""for free.""",2020-08-31
"But this ""copacetic coincidence"" no longer holds in a world of low r* in which adverse aggregate demand shocks are expected to drive the economy in at least some downturns to the ELB.",2020-08-31
"In this case, which is obviously relevant today, economic analysis indicates that flexible inflation-targeting monetary policy cannot be relied on to deliver inflation expectations that are anchored at the target, but instead will tend to deliver inflation expectations that, in each business cycle, become anchored at a level below the target.14 This is the crucial insight in my colleague John Williams' research with Thomas Mertens.",2020-08-31
"Indeed John's research over the past 20 years on r* estimation and monetary policy design at the ELB have been enormously influential, not only in the profession but also at Fed and certainly in my own thinking about how our framework should evolve.",2020-08-31
This downward bias in inflation expectations under inflation targeting in an ELB world can in turn reduce already scarce policy spaceâ€”because nominal interest rates reflect both real rates and expected inflationâ€”and it can open up the risk of the downward spiral in both actual and expected inflation that has been observed in some other major economies.,2020-08-31
"Inflation expectations are, of course, not directly observed and must be imperfectly inferred from surveys, financial market data, and econometric models.",2020-08-31
"But, at minimum, the failure of actual PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflationâ€”core or headlineâ€”over the past eight years to reach the 2 percent goal on a sustained basis cannot have contributed favorably to keeping inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent.",2020-08-31
"Indeed, my reading of the evidence is that the various measures of inflation expectations I follow reside at the low end of a range I consider consistent with our 2 percent inflation goal.15 The Review Process With this brief overview of important changes in the economic landscape since 2012, I would now like to discuss the review process itself.",2020-08-31
"In November 2018, the Federal Reserve announced that in 2019 the System would undertake a wide-ranging, public review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices.",2020-08-31
This initiative would be the first-ever public review of monetary policy strategy ever undertaken by the Fed.,2020-08-31
"A collection of the staff memos prepared for the review is now available on the Board's website.18 A New Economic Landscape Compels a Framework ReThink As I mentioned earlier, the Committee devoted five consecutive FOMC meetings between July 2019 and January 2020 to presentations by the staff and Committee discussions of memos touching on various aspects of the framework review, and it held a lengthy discussion at the July 2020 FOMC meeting about the new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.19 While it is fair to say that these Committee discussions revealed among the 17 participants a healthy range of views about and priorities for refining our framework and strategy, some common themes did emerge, and these provided the foundation for the revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that the Committee discussed in July, approved last week, and released on Thursday, August 27.",2020-08-31
"Broadly, we agreed that the economic landscape has changed in important ways since 2012 and that, as a result, the existing statement and the monetary policy strategy that flows from it need as well to evolve along several dimensions.20 For example, under our previous flexible inflation-targeting framework, the Federal Reserve declared that the 2 percent inflation objective is ""symmetric.""",2020-08-31
"This term has been interpreted by many observers to mean that the Committee's reaction function aimed to be symmetric on either side of the 2 percent inflation goal, and that the FOMC set policy with the (ex ante) aim that the 2 percent goal should represent an inflation ceiling in economic expansions following economic downturns in which inflation falls below target.",2020-08-31
"Regarding the ELB, the previous statement was silent on the global decline in neutral policy rates, the likelihood that the ELB will constrain monetary policy space in economic downturns, and the implications of this constraint for our ability to achieve our dual-mandate goals.",2020-08-31
"As for inflation expectations, the previous statement did discuss expected inflation, but only in the context of mentioning that the announcement of a 2 percent goal helps anchor inflation expectations.",2020-08-31
"While this is certainly true, it does beg the deeper question of how well anchored inflation expectations can be if the 2 percent goal is seen by the public asâ€”and turns out ex post to beâ€”a ceiling.",2020-08-31
"Regarding the maximum-employment leg of the dual mandate, the previous statement's discussion of minimizing ""deviations"" of employment from its maximum level does not adequately reflect how the FOMC has actually conducted monetary policy in recent yearsâ€”before the pandemicâ€”as the actual unemployment rate was declining and, for several years, remained below SEP median projections of u* (although, to be sure, the earlier statement did acknowledge that it can be difficult to estimate the maximum level of employment with precision).21 The New Statement and Strategy Before discussing how our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy has evolved, let me highlight some important elements that remain unchanged.",2020-08-31
"Second, our statement continues to note that the maximum level of employment that we are mandated to achieve is not directly measurable and changes over time for reasons unrelated to monetary policy.",2020-08-31
"Hence, we continue not to specify a numerical goal for our employment objective as we do for inflation.",2020-08-31
"Third, we continue to state that an inflation rate of 2 percent over the longer run is most consistent with our mandate to promote both maximum employment and price stability.",2020-08-31
"Finally, because the effect of monetary policy on the economy operates with a lag, our strategy remains forward looking.",2020-08-31
"With respect to the new framework itself, the statement now notes that the neutral level of the federal funds rate has declined relative to its historical average and therefore that the policy rate is more likely than in the past to be constrained by its ELB, and, moreover, that this binding ELB constraint is likely to impart downside risks to inflation and employment that the Committee needs to consider in implementing its monetary policy strategy.",2020-08-31
"In this regard, the statement now highlights that the Committee is prepared to use its full range of tools to achieve its dual-mandate objectives.22 Regarding the maximum-employment mandate, the new statement now acknowledges that maximum employment is a ""broad-based and inclusive goal"" and continues to state that the FOMC considers a wide range of indicators to assess the level of maximum employment consistent with this broad-based goal.",2020-08-31
"However, under our new framework, policy decisions going forward will be based on the FOMC's estimates of ""shortfalls of employment from its maximum level""â€”not ""deviations.",2020-08-31
"""23 This change conveys our judgment that a low unemployment rate by itself, in the absence of evidence that price inflation is running or is likely to run persistently above mandate-consistent levels or pressing financial stability concerns, will not, under our new framework, be a sufficient trigger for policy action.24 This is a robust evolution in the Federal Reserve's policy framework and, to me, reflects the reality that econometric models of maximum employment, while essential inputs to monetary policy, can be and have been wrong, and, moreover, that a decision to tighten monetary policy based solely on a model without any other evidence of excessive cost-push pressure that puts the price-stability mandate at risk is difficult to justify, given the significant cost to the economy if the model turns out to be wrong and given the ability of monetary policy to respond if the model were eventually to turn out to be right.25 With regard to the price-stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importanceâ€”and the challengeâ€”of keeping inflation expectations ""well anchored at 2 percent"" (and not just ""well anchored"") in a world of low r* and an ELB constraint that is binding in downturns.26 To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at 2 percent, it ""seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,"" andâ€”in the same sentenceâ€”that therefore ""following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.""",2020-08-31
"This is the second robust evolution of our framework, and it reflects the inherent asymmetry of conducting monetary policy in a low r* world with an ELB constraint that binds in economic downturns.",2020-08-31
"As discussed earlier, if policy seeks only to return inflation to 2 percent following a downturn in which the ELB has constrained policy, an inflation-targeting monetary policy will tend to generate inflation that averages less than 2 percent, which, in turn, will tend to put persistent downward pressure on inflation expectations and, potentially, on available policy space.",2020-08-31
"In order to offset this downward bias, our new framework recognizes that monetary policy during economic expansions needs to ""aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.""",2020-08-31
"In other words, the aim to achieve symmetric outcomes for inflation (as would be the case under flexible inflation targeting in the absence of the ELB constraint) requires an asymmetric monetary policy reaction function in a low r* world with binding ELB constraints in economic downturns.",2020-08-31
"It is for this reason that while our new statement no longer refers to the 2 percent inflation goal as symmetric, it does now say that the Committee ""seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time.""",2020-08-31
"To be clear, ""inflation that averages 2 percent over time"" represents an ex ante aspiration, not a description of a mechanical reaction functionâ€”nor is it a commitment to conduct monetary policy tethered to any particular formula or rule.27 Indeed, as summarized in the minutes of the September 2019 FOMC meeting, the Committee (and, certainly, I) was skeptical about the benefit, credibility, or practicality of adopting a formal numerical price level or average inflation target rule, just as it has been unwilling to implement its existing flexible inflation-targeting strategy via any sort of mechanical rule.28 So in practice, what, then, is the policy implication of this stated desire ""to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time""?",2020-08-31
"Again, the implication of our new strategy for monetary policy is stated explicitly in the new statement, and, at the risk of repeating myself, let me restate it verbatim: ""â€¦ following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.""",2020-08-31
"As Chair Powell indicated in his remarks last week, we think of this new strategy as an evolution from flexible inflation targeting to flexible average inflation targeting.29 Concluding Thoughts My remarks today have been focused on our new framework and flexible average inflation targeting strategy.",2020-08-31
"With regard to other monetary policy tools, and as we have made clear previously in the minutes to our October 2019 FOMC meeting, we do not see negative policy rates as an attractive policy option in the U.S. context.30 As for targeting the yield curve, our general view is that with credible forward guidance and asset purchases, the potential benefits from such an approach may be modest.",2020-08-31
"It was the right statement, and flexible inflation targeting was the right strategy, at that time and for the next eight years.",2020-08-31

"As with overall economic activity, conditions in the labor market have recently improved.",2021-03-25

"It is worth highlighting that in the baseline projections of the FOMC presented in the latest SEP released last week, my colleagues and I substantially revised up our outlook for the economy, projecting a relatively rapid return to levels of employment and inflation consistent with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate as compared with the recovery from the Global Financial Crisis.",2021-03-25

"Over the next few months, 12-month measures of inflation are expected to move temporarily above our 2 percent longer-run goal, owing to a run of year-over-year comparisons with depressed service-sector prices recorded in the spring of 2020 and supply bottlenecks limiting how quickly production can respond in the near term.",2021-03-25

"We also expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.",2021-03-25

What Happens during Asset-Price Run-Ups?,2005-01-12
Asset prices serve multiple roles in a modern economy.,2005-01-12
Consumers who hold assets become richer during an asset-price advance.,2005-01-12
This so-called wealth effect--always a key determinant of consumption--can be quite important during significant asset-price run-ups as consumers spend out of their capital gains.,2005-01-12
"2 Similarly, asset prices also affect business balance sheets.",2005-01-12
Rising prices for assets raise the net worth of companies that own the assets.,2005-01-12
"In the event of a default and foreclosure on a secured debt, collateral that caries a high price provides the lender with a high recovery rate, which makes lending less risky.",2005-01-12
"During an asset-price boom, the creditworthiness of borrowers rises, the interest rates at which they borrow decline because of lower risk spreads, and business investment increases as firms take advantage of the relatively lower interest rates they face.",2005-01-12
"A consequence of the positive influence of asset prices on investment is that if prospects for profitability as reflected in asset prices in one sector of the economy are advancing relative to asset prices in all other sectors, investment in that sector will outpace investment in the rest of the economy, all else equal.",2005-01-12
"In particular, if asset prices do not accurately reflect the productive potential of the underlying asset, investment will be channeled to the wrong sectors.",2005-01-12
"However, an asset-price boom in a specific sector might simply reflect investor expectations of higher productivity rather than a bubble, a term I will define in a few moments.",2005-01-12
One example of a sector-specific jump in asset prices and an associated investment increase is the case of the U.S. technology sector in the late 1990s.,2005-01-12
"Over the five years from the end of 1994 to the end of 1999, prices of nontech stocks tripled while those of tech stocks more than quintupled.3 Correspondingly, the average level of real investment in computers and other high-tech capital goods was more than 100 percent higher over the 1995-99 period than its level during 1994, while spending on other types of fixed capital was only about 15 percent higher than in 1994.",2005-01-12
"Asset-Price Busts By definition, an asset-price bust is preceded by an asset-price boom.",2005-01-12
"If a run-up reflects a bubble, the ensuing price bust could obviously be viewed as its bursting.",2005-01-12
"Alternatively, asset prices may have been driven up by expectations of a productivity boom, which would lead to improved earnings.",2005-01-12
"In that case, if the expected productivity boom does not subsequently materialize, asset prices will fall.",2005-01-12
"Nonetheless, this case may be indistinguishable from such an experience: Among other common elements, one could also see an investment overhang in the sector that saw its asset prices rise and subsequently fall.",2005-01-12
Recessions are almost always accompanied by asset-price declines.,2005-01-12
"But such declines sometimes appear to be the source of adverse surprises, and asset-price busts may subsequently have disproportionately adverse consequences.",2005-01-12
Falling asset prices create a negative wealth effect and restrain consumption.,2005-01-12
"When asset prices fall substantially, lenders may also find themselves holding substantial amounts of nonperforming loans that are backed by what may have become, in some cases, worthless collateral.",2005-01-12
"For this reason, recessions that are preceded by asset-price booms and busts may also be associated with problems in the banking industry.",2005-01-12
Concerns about the severity of downturns that follow significant asset-price collapses suggest that the identification and analysis of boom-bust asset-price cycles could be useful for policy.,2005-01-12
"For that reason, I would next like to briefly review some of the issues associated with detecting asset-price bubbles.",2005-01-12
"Detecting Bubbles The word bubble is sometimes employed to describe any quick and large increase in asset prices, but a more precise definition would associate bubbles with only those increases in asset prices that are not due to economic fundamentals.",2005-01-12
"4 Under such a definition, a bubble is present when investors buy assets at prices above their fundamental values in the expectation of being able to sell them at even higher prices in the future.5 To be sure, such departures from fundamentals may start small, but over time they could grow explosively.",2005-01-12
The fundamental price of an asset typically is defined in terms of the discounted present value of the income stream or equivalent services that the asset is expected to provide over time.,2005-01-12
"For stock prices, for example, this is the present discounted value of dividends; for real estate, it is the discounted value of the rents or services that are expected to accrue to the owner over time.",2005-01-12
An immediate difficulty is that the theoretical notion of the fundamental price does not have an easily measured empirical counterpart.,2005-01-12
"Current statistical methods are simply not up to the task of ""detecting"" asset-price bubbles, especially not in real time, when it matters most.8 ""Detecting"" a bubble appears to require judgment based on scant evidence.",2005-01-12
"The issue of detecting bubbles notwithstanding, it is of interest to know whether recessions related to sizeable asset-price busts differ from other recessions in some way that might be important for policy considerations.",2005-01-12
Are Recessions That Are Related to Asset-Price Busts Different?,2005-01-12
"Two of the longest periods of economic weakness observed in the industrialized world during the twentieth century are often identified with the asset-price busts that preceded them: the Great Depression in the United States and the ""lost decade"" of the 1990s in Japan.",2005-01-12
"In each case, rapidly falling asset prices, exacerbated by banking problems, marked the beginning of painfully long periods of economic malaise.",2005-01-12
"In part because of these two experiences, it is sometimes suggested that asset-price booms more generally lead to imbalances in the economy, and that asset-price busts and the correction of these imbalances lead to recessions that are longer, deeper, and associated with a greater fall in output and investment than other recessions.",2005-01-12
"Additionally, can one make any other generalizations concerning recessions that follow asset-price booms and busts and how they differ from other recessions?",2005-01-12
"Figure 1 presents a bird's-eye view of the evolution of asset prices and the economy from 1970 to 2003 for three of these economies, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan.9 For each country, the top panel of the figure shows the evolution of an aggregate inflation-adjusted index of asset prices--which consists of an average of stock prices and residential and commercial real estate prices.",2005-01-12
"11 Return to text The relationship of asset prices to the economy near turning points shows varying patterns (figure 1, top and bottom panels).",2005-01-12
"In some episodes, asset-price declines do not appear to have preceded the recession.",2005-01-12
"During some recessions, asset prices appear to have simply moved sideways, not registering substantial declines at all.",2005-01-12
"But in other episodes, significant asset-price booms and subsequent declines do appear before the onset of a recession and continue during the downturn.",2005-01-12
"For the United States, for example, the figure highlights the long run-up and subsequent fall in asset prices before the 2001 recession.",2005-01-12
"For the United Kingdom, one may notice the asset-price boom-bust cycle of the early 1970s followed by the painful recession beginning in 1974.",2005-01-12
"Indeed, these three episodes stand out as perhaps the clearest suggestions of an asset-price boom-bust cycle significantly influencing or possibly triggering a subsequent recession and recovery.",2005-01-12
"To be sure, such a comparison rests on (1) our identification of these three episodes as the ones that appear to have been preceded by significant asset-price booms and busts and (2) separating these recessions from the rest.",2005-01-12
"12 We have compared the average path of asset prices around the onset of the recession in these three episodes to the average path of asset prices in the other episodes in our sample (figure 2, top panel).",2005-01-12
"The dotted curve shows the average of the three asset-price related episodes, and the solid curve shows the average of the remaining twenty-two recession episodes in the sample.",2005-01-12
"13 This comparison suggests that in recessions related to asset-price busts, asset prices fall before the recession more, on average, than they do in other episodes.",2005-01-12
"Consider, for example, the average paths of estimated output gaps during asset-price busts relative to the remaining recessions (figure 2, middle panel).",2005-01-12
"The data are centered as they were for asset prices, but the output gap is normalized to equal zero in the first quarter of a recession.",2005-01-12
"As one would expect, the output gap for both groups of episodes on average falls after recessions start, but it falls less for the asset-price-bust episodes.",2005-01-12
"Finally, looking at investment (figure 2, bottom panel), the data also suggest that, on average at least, investment, like the output gap, was not affected more adversely in the three asset-price-bust episodes.",2005-01-12
"But the comparisons of the averages provided in figure 2 could obscure valuable insights that might be obtained by looking at each of our three asset-price-bust episodes individually, as I do next.",2005-01-12
Three Asset-Price-Bust Episodes Let us first examine the U.K. recession of 1974.,2005-01-12
"The large fall in average asset prices (figure 3, top panel) followed the 1973-74 oil crisis, which is also associated with somewhat smaller asset-price declines in numerous other nations.",2005-01-12
We take a closer look at the components of the aggregate asset-price index and compare their evolution around this U.K. cyclical peak to their average evolution during all recessions excluding our three asset-price-bust episodes (figure 4).,2005-01-12
Equity prices registered a remarkably sharp decline in this episode.,2005-01-12
But arguably a more distinctive characteristic of this asset-price boom-bust episode is the swing in real estate prices.,2005-01-12
"Residential real estate prices, and especially commercial real estate prices (figure 4, bottom panels), also registered rather dramatic declines in this episode.",2005-01-12
It may thus be surprising that this recession does not appear to have been deeper than the average of recessions excluding the three asset-price-bust episodes.,2005-01-12
"The output gap (figure 5) fell along with asset prices before the recession, but the decline was from an unsustainably overheated level.",2005-01-12
"Despite this episode being associated with rather severe declines in equity and commercial real estate prices, no evidence of an investment overhang appears in this comparison.",2005-01-12
"The Japanese economy saw rapidly increasing equity and real estate prices during the 1980s (figure 6), a remarkably long period of stability and prosperity.",2005-01-12
"These run-ups in asset prices were accompanied by a rapid expansion of bank credit, which was especially important for financing real estate purchases.",2005-01-12
But asset prices collapsed at the turn of the decade.,2005-01-12
"The asset-price collapse hit the Japanese banking system hard, eroding bank capital.",2005-01-12
"An economic crisis in Southeast Asia, coupled with a previously planned increase in consumption taxes, resulted in a larger-than-anticipated drag on domestic demand and set the stage for the recession that started in 1997.",2005-01-12
"Following a brief recovery, monetary policy was tightened in 2000, and the third recession in a decade followed soon after.",2005-01-12
The Japanese experience offers a reminder of the importance of monitoring the health of the financial system and the need to be especially wary of signs of fragility following a period of sharp asset-price declines.,2005-01-12
It also serves to highlight how the behavior of the banking system during the asset-price run-up may influence subsequent outcomes.,2005-01-12
"Lastly, it points to the potentially crucial role played by fiscal and monetary policies in recoveries following asset-price-bust recessions.",2005-01-12
The evolution of disaggregated asset prices (figure 10) shows that the unusually large changes surrounding the 2001 recession reflected the movement of equity prices alone.,2005-01-12
"Relative to the average episode, commercial real estate prices neither fell much during the recession nor rose a lot during the expansion.",2005-01-12
"And instead of declining during the recession, residential real estate prices continued their upward trend.",2005-01-12
The behavior of real economic activity around the recent cyclical peak (figure 11) suggests a second interesting comparison.,2005-01-12
"Relative to other recessions, this recession was shallow and did not appear to impart an unusual drag on investment, despite the sharp asset-price correction.",2005-01-12
Return to text Return to text Return to text Why was the 2001 recession relatively short and shallow even though the preceding swing in asset prices was so severe?,2005-01-12
This approach paid off handsomely when the asset-price break occurred.,2005-01-12
This comparison points to a useful policy lesson: A healthy financial sector and strong prudential regulation during an asset-price boom offer valuable insurance in case the boom turns to bust with an asset-price break.,2005-01-12
Both fiscal and monetary policy were eased quickly and effectively in this episode.,2005-01-12
The Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate rapidly to create monetary accommodation and maintained conditions of substantial monetary policy ease for a considerable period well into the expansion.,2005-01-12
"As well, the Administration and the Congress took quick steps early in the recession to provide fiscal stimulus that helped to prop up aggregate demand.",2005-01-12
"And on the monetary side, the successful completion of the last stage on the long path to price stability during the 1990s allowed substantial easing in response to the downturn.",2005-01-12
"As policymakers stressed repeatedly, the prevalence of low- and well-anchored inflation expectations ultimately facilitates pursuit of such countercyclical policy.",2005-01-12
"By pursuing fiscal prudence and price stability during booms, policymakers greatly enhance their ability to take swift, effective countercyclical action when it is needed most.",2005-01-12
"First, as already understood, detecting asset-price overvaluations and undervaluations is controversial in hindsight and arguably impossible in real time.",2005-01-12
"As a result, although asset-price booms and busts are often linked to recessions, a clear-cut policy response to suspected waves of exuberance cannot be suggested.",2005-01-12
"Second, sweeping generalizations regarding asset-price-bust recessions and subsequent recoveries are not easily made.",2005-01-12
"Third, to the extent that comparisons across recessions are informative, asset-price-bust recessions do not appear to be necessarily more costly than other recession episodes.",2005-01-12
"Specifically, at a macroeconomic level, recessions that follow swings in asset prices are not necessarily longer, deeper, and associated with a greater fall in output and investment than other recessions.",2005-01-12
"In my remarks, I will provide a brief update of the economic outlook for the United States and discuss the implications of that outlook for monetary policy.",2006-06-05
"For the past three years or so, economic growth in the United States has been robust, reflecting both the ongoing re-employment of underutilized resources as well as the expansion of the economyâ€™s underlying productive potential, as determined by factors such as productivity trends and the growth of the labor force.",2006-06-05
"Although we cannot ascertain the precise rates of resource utilization that the economy can sustain, we can have little doubt that, after three years of above-trend growth, slack has been substantially reduced.",2006-06-05
"As a consequence, a sustainable, non-inflationary expansion is likely to involve some moderation in the growth of economic activity to a rate more consistent with the expansion of the nationâ€™s underlying productive capacity.",2006-06-05
"It bears emphasizing that productivity growth seems likely to remain strong, supported by the diffusion of new technologies, capital investment, and the creative energies of businesses and workers.",2006-06-05
"Thus, productive capacity should continue to expand over the next few years at a rate consistent with solid growth of real output.",2006-06-05
"Real gross domestic product grew rapidly in the first quarter of this year, but the anticipated moderation of economic growth seems now to be under way.",2006-06-05
"One source of this deceleration is higher energy prices, which have had an adverse impact on real household incomes and weighed on consumer attitudes.",2006-06-05
"However, overall, housing activity has softened relative to the high levels of last summer, and the rate of house-price appreciation appears to have lessened.",2006-06-05
"Gains in payroll employment in recent months have been smaller than their average of the past couple of years, and initial claims for unemployment insurance have edged up.",2006-06-05
These developments are consistent with the softening in the pace of overall economic activity that seems to be under way.,2006-06-05
"That said, going forward, relatively low unemployment and rising disposable incomes may counter to some extent the factors tending to restrain household spending.",2006-06-05
"Globally, output growth appears poised to exceed 4 percent for the fourth consecutive year--a strong performance that will support the U.S. economy by continuing to stimulate our exports of goods and services.",2006-06-05
"In particular, the increased world demand for crude oil and other primary commodities, together with the limited ability of suppliers to expand capacity in the short run, has led to substantial increases in the global prices of those goods.",2006-06-05
Those price increases are a partial offset to the forces supporting global growth and are also a source of inflationary pressure.,2006-06-05
"Along with greater national saving in the United States, increased domestic demand in countries with current account surpluses and a greater flexibility of exchange rates more broadly would help to reduce those imbalances over time.",2006-06-05
"Should U.S. economic growth moderate as expected, sustaining the global expansion will require a greater reliance by our trading partners on their own domestic spending as a source of growth.",2006-06-05
"Consumer price inflation has been elevated so far this year, due in large part to increases in energy prices.",2006-06-05
"Core inflation readings--that is, measures excluding the prices of food and energy--have also been higher in recent months.",2006-06-05
"While monthly inflation data are volatile, core inflation measured over the past three to six months has reached a level that, if sustained, would be at or above the upper end of the range that many economists, including myself, would consider consistent with price stability and the promotion of maximum long-run growth.",2006-06-05
"For example, at annual rates, core inflation as measured by the consumer price index excluding food and energy prices was 3.2 percent over the past three months and 2.8 percent over the past six months.",2006-06-05
"For core inflation based on the price index for personal consumption expenditures, the corresponding three-month and six-month figures are 3.0 percent and 2.3 percent.",2006-06-05
"Although the rate of pass-through from the higher prices of energy and other commodities to core consumer price inflation appears to have remained relatively low, the cumulative increases in energy and commodity prices have been large enough that they could account for some of the recent pickup in core inflation.",2006-06-05
"Despite recent increases in spot oil prices, futures markets imply that oil prices are not expected to continue rising.",2006-06-05
The realization of that outcome would reduce one source of upward pressure on inflation.,2006-06-05
"However, the volatility of these and other commodity prices is such that possible future increases in these prices remain a risk to the inflation outlook.",2006-06-05
"Subdued growth in most broad measures of nominal labor compensation and the ongoing expansion of labor productivity have held down the rise in unit labor costs, the largest component of business costs.",2006-06-05
"Finally, some survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have edged up, on net, in recent months, as has the compensation for inflation and inflation risk implied by yields on nominal and inflation-indexed government debt.",2006-06-05
"With the economy now evidently in a period of transition, monetary policy must be conducted with great care and with close attention to the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information.",2006-06-05
"Given recent developments, the medium-term outlook for inflation will receive particular scrutiny.",2006-06-05
There is a strong consensus among the members of the Federal Open Market Committee that maintaining low and stable inflation is essential for achieving both parts of the dual mandate assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congress.,2006-06-05
"In particular, the evidence of recent decades, both from the United States and other countries, supports the conclusion that an environment of price stability promotes maximum sustainable growth in employment and output and a more stable real economy.",2006-06-05
"Therefore, the Committee will be vigilant to ensure that the recent pattern of elevated monthly core inflation readings is not sustained.",2006-06-05
"Toward this end, and taking full account of the lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, the Committee will seek a trajectory for the economy that aligns economic activity with underlying productive capacity.",2006-06-05
Achieving this balance will foster sustainable growth and help to forestall one potential source of inflation pressure.,2006-06-05
"In addition, the Committee must continue to resist any tendency for increases in energy and commodity prices to become permanently embedded in core inflation.",2006-06-05
The best way to prevent increases in energy and commodity prices from leading to persistently higher rates of inflation is by anchoring the publicâ€™s long-term inflation expectations.,2006-06-05
We economists have made some important strides in our understanding of inflation dynamics in recent years.,2007-03-23
"Today, I will outline what I see as the key stylized facts that research has in recent years uncovered about changes in the dynamics of inflation and will present my view of how to interpret these findings.",2007-03-23
The interpretation has important implications for how we should think about the conduct of monetary policy and what we think might happen to inflation over the next couple of years.,2007-03-23
"The Empirical Evidence on Changes in Inflation Dynamics To see what research has discovered about the evolution of inflation dynamics in recent years, letâ€™s explore the following questions: (1) What is the available evidence on changes in inflation persistence in recent years?",2007-03-23
(3) What role do other variables play in the inflation process?,2007-03-23
"Inflation Persistence To answer the first question, we need to measure how long the effects of a shock to inflation will last.",2007-03-23
"Specifically, we need to know whether inflation tends to revert quickly to its initial level, or whether the effects of the shock persist--that is, lead to a changed level of inflation for an extended period.",2007-03-23
The most obvious way of measuring inflation persistence is to regress inflation on several of its own lags and then calculate the sum of the coefficients on lagged inflation.,2007-03-23
"If the sum of the coefficients is close to 1.0, then shocks to inflation have long-lived effects on inflation.",2007-03-23
"In other words, inflation behaves like a random walk, so that when inflation goes up, it stays up.",2007-03-23
"If the sum of the coefficients drops well below 1.0, then a shock to inflation has only a temporary effect on inflation, and inflation soon reverts back to its trend level.",2007-03-23
The evidence from these so-called autoregressions with U.S. data suggests that inflation may have grown less persistent over time.,2007-03-23
"Figure 1 illustrates this tendency, with the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index as the measure of inflation.",2007-03-23
"Recent work by Jim Stock and Mark Watson (2007) provides an alternative and, to me, a quite intuitive way of thinking about inflation persistence.",2007-03-23
They estimate a model that decomposes inflation into two components.,2007-03-23
"The first component, which can be thought of as the underlying trend, follows a random walk, so that shocks to this component persist indefinitely and thus affect the trend inflation rate going forward.",2007-03-23
"When the relative importance of the trend shocks became high, as it did in the 1970s and early 1980s, inflation became highly persistent.",2007-03-23
"Under such conditions, if inflation went up, the trend component typically rose in tandem so that inflation stayed up.",2007-03-23
"In contrast, when the temporary shocks were relatively more important, as was true before the 1970s and after the mid-1980s, a change in inflation tended to reflect a change in the temporary component, not the trend.",2007-03-23
"As a result, fluctuations in inflation tended to fade away, implying that inflation persistence was much lower.",2007-03-23
"In the context of the Stock-Watson model, then, when inflation rose to double-digit levels during the ""Great Inflation"" period of the 1970s and early 1980s, persistence became very high because the trend rate of inflation moved around a lot--that is, trend inflation became unanchored.",2007-03-23
"For example, Cecchetti et al (2007) employ a slightly modified version of the Stock-Watson procedure in a recent paper and find that inflation persistence has fallen so low that their estimated trend for gross domestic product (GDP) price inflation has been almost perfectly flat at about 2.2 percent over the past few years.",2007-03-23
"Finally, follow-up work by staff members at the Federal Reserve Board suggests that the degree of persistence found with these techniques varies across different measures of inflation.",2007-03-23
"Nonetheless, I think it fair to say that inflation has become less persistent over the past two decades but that the underlying trend may not yet be perfectly stable.",2007-03-23
"In short, all these countries experienced a similar ""Great Inflation,"" when trend inflation became unanchored.",2007-03-23
"Germany and Japan had shorter periods of high persistence of inflation, with persistence beginning to decline around 1969 in Germany and around 1979 in Japan.",2007-03-23
Cecchetti and his co-authors conclude that the rise and subsequent decline of inflation persistence has thus been a worldwide phenomenon.,2007-03-23
"Slope of the Phillips Curve In traditional Phillips-curve equations, inflation depends on past values of inflation, an unemployment gap (the difference between the unemployment rate and an estimate of its natural rate), and variables such as the relative price of energy and import prices.",2007-03-23
"When researchers estimate these equations, they typically find that the coefficient on the unemployment gap has declined (in absolute value) since the 1980s, often by a marked amount.4 In other words, the evidence suggests that the Phillips curve has flattened.",2007-03-23
"The finding that inflation is less responsive to the unemployment gap, if taken at face value, suggests that fluctuations in resource utilization will have smaller implications for inflation than used to be the case.",2007-03-23
"From the point of view of policymakers, this development is a two-edged sword: On the plus side, it implies that an overheating economy will tend to generate a smaller increase in inflation.",2007-03-23
"On the negative side, however, a flatter Phillips curve also implies that a given increase in inflation will be more costly to wring out of the system.",2007-03-23
We can quantify this latter consideration using the so-called sacrifice ratio--the number of years that unemployment has to be 1.0 percentage point greater than its natural rate to reduce the inflation rate 1.0 percentage point.,2007-03-23
"Averaging estimates obtained from a comprehensive battery of equation specifications suggests that the sacrifice ratio may be 40 percent larger--that is, it may be 40 percent more costly to reduce inflation than it was two decades ago.",2007-03-23
Role of Other Variables in the Inflation Process Empirical evidence suggests that inflation has also become less responsive to other shocks.,2007-03-23
"The two oil price shocks in the 1970s were associated with large jumps in core inflation, whereas recent surges in energy prices have not had a similar effect.",2007-03-23
This reduced sensitivity manifests itself in traditional Phillips-curve models as a substantial decline in the estimated coefficient on the energy price term in these equations.,2007-03-23
"Because this term equals the change in relative energy prices multiplied by the share of energy in aggregate output, energy price effects on inflation appear to have fallen by more than can be accounted for by the greater energy efficiency of the economy.5 In contrast, unpublished empirical work by the staff at the Federal Reserve Board suggests that, once we take the rising share of imports into account, the influence of import prices on core inflation in the United States has not changed much in the context of reduced-form forecasting models.6 At the same time, the influence of exchange rate movements on import prices--the so-called pass-through effect--may have fallen substantially, at least according to some studies.7 If so, then the influence of exchange rate fluctuations on domestic inflation may now be less than it once was, when one controls for changes in the volume of our foreign trade.",2007-03-23
What Interpretation Can We Give to Changes in Inflation Dynamics?,2007-03-23
"In interpreting these stylized facts about changes in inflation dynamics, we must first recognize that all of them are based on reduced-form relationships, and thus they are about correlations and not necessarily about true structural relationships.",2007-03-23
"Because the explanatory variables in inflation regressions are themselves influenced by changes in economic conditions, changes in the underlying monetary policy regime are likely to be a source of changes in reduced-form inflation dynamics.",2007-03-23
"In such cases, we cannot use the reduced-form equations to disentangle the effects of such unobserved factors--which themselves may be driven by changes in monetary policy--from that of other influences.",2007-03-23
Theory tells us that inflation expectations must be a key driving force behind inflation.,2007-03-23
"This dependence has long been implicit in traditional Phillips-curve analysis, but expectations--now in explicit form--are also a central feature of the increasingly popular New Keynesian Phillips curves, in which current-period inflation is a function of expectations of next periodâ€™s inflation and resource utilization.",2007-03-23
"Therefore, a natural first place to look for explanations of changing inflation dynamics is a possible change in the expectations-formation process.",2007-03-23
"The first stylized fact discussed earlier is that inflation persistence, which rose in the 1970s during the Great Inflation, has since declined to a much lower level.",2007-03-23
"An intuitive way of thinking about this rise and fall in inflation persistence is that it resulted from an un-anchoring of trend inflation during the period of the Great Inflation, and a re-anchoring in recent years, as the work of Stock and Watson suggests.",2007-03-23
"When we think about what drives trend inflation, inflation expectations--particularly long-run expectations--come to mind.",2007-03-23
"A de-anchoring of inflation expectations would surely lead to trend inflation becoming unanchored, whereas an anchoring of inflation expectations at a particular level would necessarily lead to a stabilization of trend inflation and hence a decline in inflation persistence.",2007-03-23
Do indicators of inflation expectations support this story?,2007-03-23
Consider the measure of expected inflation for the coming twelve months reported by the Livingston survey.,2007-03-23
"As illustrated by the dashed line in figure 3 , this measure of expected short-run inflation--adjusted by a constant factor to convert it from a CPI basis to a PCE basis--soared during the 1970s and then fell back markedly during the 1980s and early 1990s.",2007-03-23
"Over the past few years, the short-run series has fluctuated around 2 percent, with its month-to-month movements correlated with swings in energy prices, as one might expect.",2007-03-23
"An even more striking story is told by the survey-based measure of expected long-run inflation used in the FRB/US model, the dotted blue line in figure 3.8 When we look at this long-run series (which should be more closely related to expectations about policy objectives than the short-run measure), we see that the publicâ€™s expectations stood at a high level of 7-3/4 percent at the start of the 1980s, when this information first began to be collected.",2007-03-23
Estimates of inflation compensation derived from indexed Treasury yields have also been remarkably stable in recent years.,2007-03-23
Figure 3 also reproduces the estimate of trend inflation produced by the Stock-Watson procedure (the solid line).,2007-03-23
"As you can see, this series more or less tracks the survey-based measures of long-run expectations, suggesting that the anchoring of long-run inflation expectations in recent years may explain the finding of a marked decline in inflation persistence.",2007-03-23
Anchoring of inflation expectations is not a deus ex machina.,2007-03-23
"It must come from somewhere, and since Milton Friedmanâ€™s adage that â€œ[i]nflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenonâ€ is still true, monetary policy must be the source of the change in the evolution of long-run inflation expectations.",2007-03-23
"During the 1960s and 1970s, the Federal Reserve and a number of other central banks maintained a policy stance that, inadvertently or not, was too easy on average and that allowed both actual and expected inflation to drift up markedly over many years.",2007-03-23
"Since the late 1970s, however, the Federal Reserve and many other central banks have increased their commitment to price stability, in both words and actions.",2007-03-23
"The Fed pursued preemptive strikes against rises in inflation in 1994-95, 1999-00, and in 2004-06, as well as preemptive strikes against potentially deflationary forces in the fall of 1998 and in 2001-04.",2007-03-23
"The result has been not only low and stable inflation but also, as we have seen, a strong anchoring of long-run inflation expectations.",2007-03-23
The pursuit of more-aggressive monetary policy to control inflation and the achievement of anchored inflation expectations can also help explain the other stylized facts about inflation dynamics.,2007-03-23
"With expectations of inflation anchored, any given shock to inflation--whether it is from aggregate demand, energy prices, or the foreign exchange rate--will have a smaller effect on expected inflation and hence on trend inflation.",2007-03-23
These shocks will then have a much less persistent effect on actual inflation.,2007-03-23
The recent experience with surging oil prices seems consistent with this story.,2007-03-23
The price of West Texas intermediate crude oil rose from about $30 per barrel in late 2003 to a peak of almost $75 per barrel in July of last year.,2007-03-23
"During this episode, inflation appears to have been boosted only temporarily and by a strikingly small amount, in contrast to the 1970s when oil price shocks led to large, persistent increases in inflation.",2007-03-23
"Interestingly, monetary policy could have worked to flatten the estimated Phillips curve even without these favorable expectational effects, simply by moving more aggressively to stabilize both inflation and output.",2007-03-23
"Thus, a monetary policy that more successfully stabilizes inflation and resource utilization could well lead to a smaller estimated coefficient on unemployment gaps in a traditional Phillips-curve equation.",2007-03-23
"In particular, their analyses suggest that changes in the way the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy--including changes in both the parameters of monetary policy reaction functions and the volatility of shocks to those functions--may account for most of the reduction in the coefficients on resource utilization in traditional Phillips curves.9 What is particularly attractive about highlighting a better anchoring of inflation expectations as probably the primary factor driving the changes in inflation dynamics is that this one explanation covers so many of the stylized facts--an application of Occamâ€™s razor.",2007-03-23
"Indeed, I have always become more confident in a theory if it can explain a number of very different facts.10 This is why I am so attracted to the view that inflation expectations are a key driving factor in the inflation process.",2007-03-23
"Of course, many other factors also influence inflation, and some of these provide other possible explanations for the recent changes in inflation dynamics.",2007-03-23
"For example, smaller coefficients on unemployment gaps and energy prices in traditional Phillips curve equations may reflect the influence of lower and less-variable inflation on the frequency with which firms change their prices.",2007-03-23
"In the context of a low-inflation environment, firms may have concluded that they can leave their prices fixed for longer periods at little cost, causing inflation to be less responsive to shocks, particularly if they are transitory.",2007-03-23
"In this way, monetary policy may have affected the slope of the Phillips curve without having affected the manner in which expectations are formed.",2007-03-23
"Also, from the mid-1980s through the first years of this decade, energy price movements were smaller and more transitory.",2007-03-23
"We see this in futures markets, in which oil prices in far-dated futures contracts moved much less than spot prices over this period, suggesting that people expected a quick reversal in any rise in oil prices.",2007-03-23
Such transitory shocks to energy price would presumably have a smaller effect on inflation than the more-persistent oil price shocks of the 1970s and early 1980s.,2007-03-23
"Increased globalization and other sources of increased competition may also have lowered the sensitivity of domestic inflation to aggregate demand, thereby flattening the Phillips curve.",2007-03-23
"However, the evidence on this last point is limited and inconclusive.11 Policy Implications These stylized facts--that inflation has become less persistent and now responds less to aggregate demand and supply shocks--can lead to inappropriate policy advice.",2007-03-23
"If we take these facts to be structural and attributable to factors other than monetary policy, we might interpret them as suggesting that the Federal Reserve could respond less to shocks and yet be confident that inflation would remain at a low level.",2007-03-23
"In addition, the smaller coefficient on unemployment gaps in traditional Phillips-curve models, which seems to imply that the sacrifice ratio has gone up, might lead us to think that reducing inflation is very costly because it requires long periods of high unemployment.",2007-03-23
"As a result, policymakers might decide that such an attempt would not be worthwhile and so would be less likely to try to reduce inflation if it were undesirably high.",2007-03-23
"If used in model simulation exercises, the flatter Phillips curve might also suggest that getting inflation down to a particular desired level could take an inordinately long time.",2007-03-23
"However, if we instead attribute the observed changes in inflation dynamics to better monetary policy and a resultant better anchoring of inflation expectations, then such policy conclusions are unwarranted.",2007-03-23
"Under this alternative interpretation, the reason that inflation has become less persistent is that monetary policy, in carrying out its dual mandate of promoting both price stability and maximum sustainable employment, has been vigilant in maintaining a low rate of inflation on average.",2007-03-23
"But if the monetary authorities were to become complacent and to think that they could get away with not reacting to shocks that, in their mistaken view, no longer have the potential to cause inflation to rise persistently, then inflation expectations would surely become unhinged again.",2007-03-23
"In short, complacency that might arise from the current low inflation persistence might result in deja vu all over again and return us to an era like the Great Inflation.",2007-03-23
"These are exactly the concerns expressed in Tom Sargentâ€™s (2000) book on the rise and fall of U.S. inflation, in which he worries that a misunderstanding of the inflation process might again lead to a high-inflation equilibrium.",2007-03-23
"If inflation has indeed become less persistent because better monetary policy has anchored inflation expectations more solidly, the monetary authorities may find that they have less need to induce large swings in economic activity to control inflation.",2007-03-23
"If this hypothesis is correct, cyclical movements in interest rates need not be as great as was necessary when expectations were unanchored.",2007-03-23
"Consistent with its dual mandate, the Fed must therefore continue to respond aggressively to shocks that have potentially persistent adverse effects on both inflation and real activity.",2007-03-23
"Because long-run inflation expectations are a key driver of trend inflation, the monetary authorities need to monitor long-run inflation expectations closely.",2007-03-23
"If they find that they are losing credibility with the markets, so that inflation expectations begin to drift and rise above (or fall below) a desired level, they must take actions to restore their credibility.",2007-03-23
"At the Federal Reserve, we understand the importance to the health of the economy of anchoring inflation expectations.",2007-03-23
"This is why Federal Reserve officials continually reiterate our commitment to maximum sustainable employment and price stability, why we have been willing to make preemptive strikes against both inflationary and deflationary pressures, and why we remain vigilant about developments in the economy that could lead to persistent departures of inflation from levels that are consistent with price stability.",2007-03-23
"My view--that recent changes in inflation dynamics result primarily from better-anchored inflation expectations and not from structural change or simply the achievement of a persistent low rate of inflation--implies some very good news: Potentially inflationary shocks, like a sharp rise in energy prices, are less likely to spill over into expected and actual core inflation.",2007-03-23
"Therefore, the Fed does not have to respond as aggressively as would be necessary if inflation expectations were unanchored, as they were during the Great Inflation era.",2007-03-23
"Indeed, this can help explain why the recent sharp rises in energy prices have had a much more benign effect on the real economy than they did in the 1970s--a point that then-Governor Ben Bernanke made three years ago.",2007-03-23
"Although solidly anchored inflation expectations are indeed highly desirable, they could pose a bit of a problem for monetary policy if they were at a level somewhat above or below the rate preferred by policymakers.",2007-03-23
"In some early models that used the rational expectations assumption, changing inflation expectations was relatively easy and thus implied sacrifice ratios that were extremely low, suggesting that the monetary authorities could shift inflation at little cost.",2007-03-23
"However, the historical record suggests that permanently lowering inflation expectations may require keeping monetary policy tight for a substantial period, resulting in considerable output and employment losses for a time.",2007-03-23
"On the other hand, as Christy and David Romer (2002) have pointed out, the Federal Reserve in the 1970s overestimated the cost of reducing inflation because estimates of sacrifice ratios by Arthur Okun and other economists at that time proved to be too high.12 As a historical note, this provides one explanation for the Federal Reserveâ€™s tolerance of such high inflation at the time.",2007-03-23
"The disinflation after October 1979, carried out by the Federal Reserve under the leadership of Paul Volcker using words, procedures, and actions that were a sharp break from the past, produced a much lower cost of disinflation than policymakers had anticipated during the 1970s.",2007-03-23
I think these considerations leave us with fairly wide bounds on what the costs might be of permanently shifting long-run inflation expectations that are already anchored.,2007-03-23
Implications for Inflation Forecasts I have argued here that the most attractive explanation for recent changes in inflation dynamics is that expectations have become better anchored.,2007-03-23
Inflation is now less persistent and more likely to gravitate to a trend level that is determined by where long-run inflation expectations have settled.,2007-03-23
What implication does this have for forecasts of future inflation?,2007-03-23
"In this framework, the first priority is to determine where inflation expectations may be anchored.",2007-03-23
"According to the latest reading from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF), long-term inflation expectations are currently around 2 percent, as measured by the PCE price index that the FOMC has emphasized.",2007-03-23
"The private forecasters appear to have held this view for many years, given that long-run expectations for CPI inflation in the SPF have been running at around 2-1/2 percent since the late 1990s, and that the average historical wedge between the CPI measure and the PCE measure of inflation has been about 50 basis points.13 Of course, the views of professional forecasters may not be representative of what the average person or firm is thinking.If we turn to the financial markets, we find that inflation expectations extracted from a comparison of the yields between Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) and standard Treasury securities seem consistent with an anchor at or perhaps a little above 2 percent in terms of PCE inflation.14 I say â€œseem consistent,â€ because we cannot be sure about at least one of the items used in the extraction, the premium paid to investors to compensate them for inflation risk.",2007-03-23
"In the case of households, long-term inflation expectations from the Reuters/Michigan survey have been running much higher for a number of years, at around 3 percent.",2007-03-23
"However, this figure seems overstated in light of the persistent bias found in the short-term inflation expectations reported by this survey.",2007-03-23
"Correcting for the bias, these survey results are probably more in line with PCE inflation closer to 2 percent.15 As for firms, we unfortunately have no good data on their inflation expectations.",2007-03-23
"Taken together, the data suggest to me that long-run inflation expectations are currently around 2 percent.",2007-03-23
"If long-run expectations are in fact about 2 percent, where is actual inflation likely to be headed in the next year or two?",2007-03-23
"While recognizing how embarrassingly wrong such prognostications often turn out to be, I think that we can be reasonably optimistic that core PCE inflation will gradually drift down from its latest twelve-month reading of 2-1/4 percent.",2007-03-23
This process may take a while in light of the recent rebound in prices for gasoline and other petroleum products.,2007-03-23
"These price increases have boosted the cost of producing many non-energy goods and services, and as firms gradually pass on these higher costs to their customers, monthly readings on the change in core prices are likely to be higher than they otherwise would be.",2007-03-23
"Once this process is completed, however, we might expect consumer price inflation to move into better alignment with long-run expectations and thus settle in around 2 percent.",2007-03-23
"Of course, our understanding of the empirical links between our measures of expected inflation and actual inflation is sufficiently poor that things could well go awry with this forecast.",2007-03-23
"Moreover, many things could happen in the coming months to alter the outlook, as the recent fluctuations in energy markets and swings in GDP growth illustrate.",2007-03-23
"Looking to the medium term, I am less optimistic about the prospects for core PCE inflation to move much below 2 percent in the absence of a determined effort by monetary policy.",2007-03-23
"For the most part, this assessment--which I should stress is subject to considerable uncertainty--flows from my view that long-term expectations appear to be well anchored at a level not very far below the current rate of inflation.",2007-03-23
"If so, a substantial further decline in inflation would require a shift in expectations, and such a shift could be difficult and time consuming to bring about, as I noted earlier.",2007-03-23
"In this environment, the unemployment rate fell to 4 percent, and the underlying rate of price inflation slowed, on net, despite very high rates of resource utilization.",2001-06-14
Productivity Growth and Cost Reductions So how did this confluence of positive events come about?,2001-06-14
The dominant force of late appears to have been a significant increase in the structural rate of productivity growth.,2001-06-14
"Output per hour in the nonfarm business sector--a conventional measure of productivity--increased at an annual rate of almost 3 percent between 1995 and 1999, roughly twice the average pace that had prevailed over the preceding two decades.",2001-06-14
"The most important explanation for this increase in the rate of productivity growth, I suspect, is longer-term structural changes arising from the boom in capital spending and the revolution in information technology.",2001-06-14
Technological Change and Productivity Growth Bob Solow--the MIT economist who won the Nobel Prize in economics for his work on the theory of economic growth--once quipped that you can see computers everywhere except in the productivity statistics.,2001-06-14
"A few years ago that situation began to change, and we now have strong evidence that the faster productivity growth our economy has experienced is, in fact, due partly to the information technology revolution.",2001-06-14
Research by Federal Reserve Board economists Steve Oliner and Dan Sichel sheds some light on the sources of this faster productivity growth.,2001-06-14
The high (and rising) levels of business investment raised the amount of capital per worker and thereby boosted productivity.,2001-06-14
"About 1/2 percentage point of the increase in productivity growth over the 1995-99 period can be attributed to this so-called ""capital deepening,"" most of which reflected greater spending by businesses on computers, software, and communications equipment.",2001-06-14
Oliner and Sichel estimate that the consolidated influences of information technology investments account for about two-thirds of the acceleration in productivity since 1995.,2001-06-14
"That trend productivity has picked up and that high-tech investments are the source of the acceleration are important facts, but by now they are not new observations.",2001-06-14
The second feature of high-tech equipment that sets it apart from other classes of capital is the sensitivity of demand to fluctuations in the cost of capital.,2001-06-14
The latest research suggests that the demand for computers is quite sensitive to movements in the cost of capital.,2001-06-14
The combination of an apparently high price elasticity and a rapid decline in relative computer prices--20 percent per year over the past decade--likely led to the boom in high-tech investment.,2001-06-14
"In many industries, investments in information technologies have helped firms to cut back on the volume of inventories that they hold as a precaution against glitches in their supply chain or as a hedge against unexpected increases in aggregate demand.",2001-06-14
The focus on cost reduction has worked to head off the development of inflationary pressures in this expansion.,2001-06-14
"Productivity and the Current Macroeconomic Setting As you are aware, the United States is experiencing a period of subpar growth.",2001-06-14
"For the last three quarters, the annualized growth rate has been 1 3/4 percent, which is well below the trend rate of growth that many think our economy can sustain.",2001-06-14
"During this period, productivity grew at an annual rate of about 2 ½ percent during the second half of 2000 and declined at an annual rate of 1 ¼ percent during the first quarter of this year.",2001-06-14
"This slowing in productivity growth has led a number of observers to ask whether the acceleration of productivity of the latter part of the 1990s was a cyclical phenomenon, which was bound to come to an end when the economy slowed, or a structural one.",2001-06-14
"Cyclical forces, such as the inability of businesses to add to their payrolls as rapidly as they would have liked in response to the rise in demand, probably played some role in these productivity gains.",2001-06-14
"However, I believe that the answer to the question is that most of the growth in productivity was structural, or trend, and not cyclical.",2001-06-14
"We should also be mindful that even during the period between 1995 and 2000, productivity increases on a quarterly basis fluctuated; the trend increase that is so clear now did not progress unabated.",2001-06-14
Two fundamental factors lead me to be cautiously optimistic that the much of the improvement in productivity is likely to be sustained.,2001-06-14
"Notable advances in microprocessors, or semiconductors, have been key to the enhanced productivity growth that we have experienced.",2001-06-14
"A second reason to expect that much of the improvement in productivity growth is trend and not cyclical is that businesses indicate in their words and their deeds a commitment to improving productivity and maintaining costs by substituting capital, mainly IT capability, for labor.",2001-06-14
Overall growth of the economy has slowed to a pace between 1 percent and 2 percent at an annual rate for the most recent three quarters.,2001-06-14
"However, investment in equipment and software has held at relatively high levels and is still sufficient to maintain relatively rapid growth of capital services.",2001-06-14
"Moreover, end-use demand for communications services seems to remain strong.",2001-06-14
The Role of Government Policy You will have noted that I have not mentioned the role of government policy in creating a higher rate of trend productivity growth.,2001-06-14
"As a policymaker, I'd like to think that well-executed monetary and fiscal policies--each focused importantly on their respective long-run goals--played some role in creating economic conditions that fostered noninflationary economic growth.",2001-06-14
"It is important to note, however, that although sound policy undoubtedly helped create the conditions for growth, macroeconomic policy cannot create growth itself.",2001-06-14
"Again, as with macroeconomic policy, a policy of deregulating industry cannot create greater potential growth, but it can create the conditions under which such growth might occur.",2001-06-14
"Thus, the United States has experienced a demand for educational services catering to participants at various stages in life.",2001-06-14
"The demand for skill development and upgrading has been met in a number of ways--through on-the-job training, at so-called corporate universities, and in a range of public and private institutions of higher learning.",2001-06-14
"In addition, the U.S. government influenced the increase in productivity growth by supporting the early development of what later became known as the Internet.",2001-06-14
The Macroeconomic Implications of Faster Productivity Growth Theory teaches us that the step-up in the growth rate of productivity will have important and pervasive implications for the performance of the economy.,2001-06-14
The main reason policymakers and economists are interested in the growth rate of productivity is that it is the crucial determinant of the rate of change in the general standard of living.,2001-06-14
"If productivity increases 1 ½ percent per year on average, the standard of living will double about every 46 years--or about every two generations.",2001-06-14
"On the other hand, if trend productivity growth steps up to 3 percent per year, the standard of living will double roughly every 23 years--or about every generation.",2001-06-14
A second important reason for being interested in the growth rate of productivity is that in the near term it affects both the supply of and demand for goods and services.,2001-06-14
"On the supply side, the effect is fairly clear and immediate: An increase in trend productivity growth implies a more rapid pace of growth of the economy's productive capacity.",2001-06-14
"Separately, businesses may respond to the increase in trend productivity growth by stepping up the pace of their investment in plant and equipment, further boosting the growth in the supply potential of the economy.",2001-06-14
How does the increase in trend productivity growth play out on the demand side of the economy?,2001-06-14
"In addition, stock market investors will react to the pickup in productivity growth by looking ahead, recognizing the improved prospects for future earnings, and bidding up equity prices today.",2001-06-14
"The run-up in equity prices implies a reduction in the cost of capital for businesses, which could support a further increase in investment demand, especially on the part of firms that rely on this market for at least part of their funding.",2001-06-14
"And to put a rough number on the impact on aggregate activity more recently, simulations by the Board staff using our econometric model of the economy suggest that wealth generated in the equity markets over the past four years added about 1 percentage point to the growth rate of real GDP.",2001-06-14
"Overall, the stock market, working through the spending decisions of both households and businesses, will act to bring forward the demand effects of the improved outlook for supply, potentially even pushing demand up ahead of the increase in supply.",2001-06-14
It is important to emphasize that higher productivity growth translates into higher real income growth for employees.,2001-06-14
"But real incomes should increase even for workers whose compensation is not directly linked to company performance, as profitable business opportunities bolster the demand for scarce labor.",2001-06-14
Conclusion Obviously the history of the productivity surprise in the United States is a long and complex one.,2001-06-14
"But policymakers watch financial markets carefully for another reason, which is that asset prices and yields are potentially valuable sources of timely information about economic and financial conditions.",2004-04-15
"Because the future returns on most financial assets depend sensitively on economic conditions, asset prices--if determined in sufficiently liquid markets--should embody a great deal of investors' collective information and beliefs about the future course of the economy.",2004-04-15
"As you will see, asset prices provide information, particularly about market expectations, that is difficult to obtain elsewhere.",2004-04-15
"However, a recurring theme of my remarks will be that extracting accurate information from asset prices and yields is more difficult and requires greater sophistication than is commonly supposed.",2004-04-15
Ongoing research in financial economics thus has great potential to provide practical assistance to monetary policy makers.,2004-04-15
"As usual, the views I will express today are not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.1 Market Expectations of Inflation: The Information in Inflation-Indexed Securities I will begin by discussing what financial markets can tell us about inflation expectations.",2004-04-15
"The inflation expectations of financial-market participants are of particular interest to central bankers, for several reasons.",2004-04-15
"First, as price stability is a key objective of monetary policy, the Federal Reserve puts substantial resources into forecasting inflation.",2004-04-15
"To the extent that financial markets serve to aggregate private-sector information about the likely future course of inflation, data on asset prices and yields might be used to validate and perhaps improve the Fed's forecasts.",2004-04-15
"Second, inflation expectations are of interest to policymakers independent of inflation itself.",2004-04-15
"A considerable literature suggests that successful monetary policies should stabilize, or ""anchor,"" inflation expectations so as to prevent them from becoming a source of instability in their own right (Goodfriend, 1993; Evans and Honkapohja, 2003).",2004-04-15
"Finally, knowledge of the expectations of inflation in financial markets permits the calculation of real interest rates, which are important indicators of both the condition of the economy and the stance of monetary policy.",2004-04-15
"Although clues about inflation expectations abound in financial markets, inflation-indexed securities would appear to be the most direct source of information about inflation expectations and real interest rates.2 Government securities whose realized yields depend on inflation, known on the Street as ""linkers,"" have become increasingly common in industrial countries, Japan being the latest nation to introduce an inflation-indexed government bond.",2004-04-15
"The U.S. Treasury began issuing TIIS (for Treasury inflation-indexed securities), more popularly known as TIPS (for Treasury inflation-protected securities), in January 1997.",2004-04-15
"To provide the promised real yield, TIPS coupon and principal payments are escalated based on increases in the consumer price index from the time at which the security was issued.",2004-04-15
"The difference between the real yield guaranteed by an inflation-linked security and the nominal yield provided by a conventional security of the same maturity is known as the breakeven inflation rate or, alternatively, as inflation compensation.",2004-04-15
The vertical distance between the two lines is known as breakeven inflation at the ten-year horizon.,2004-04-15
The bottom panel uses overlapping issues of nominal securities and TIPS to disaggregate breakeven inflation into the rate that applies to bonds maturing five years from now and the implied forward breakeven rate from five to ten years out.,2004-04-15
The breakeven rate of inflation is often treated as a direct reading of investors' expectations of inflation.,2004-04-15
"Under this interpretation, the lower line in the bottom panel of Figure 1 is an estimate of market inflation expectations over the next five years, and the upper line represents five-year forward expectations of inflation, that is, today's expectation of what average inflation will be between 2009 and 2014.",2004-04-15
"Unfortunately, as a measure of market participants' expected inflation, breakeven inflation has a number of problems (Sack, 2000; Shen and Corning, 2001).",2004-04-15
"First, and probably the most important, breakeven inflation includes a return to investors for bearing inflation risk, implying that the breakeven rate likely overstates the market's expected rate of inflation.",2004-04-15
"Estimates of the inflation risk premium for bonds maturing during the next five to ten years are surprisingly large, generally in a range between 35 and 100 basis points, depending on the time period studied (Ang and Bekaert, 2003; Goto and Torous, 2003; Buraschi and Jiltsov, 2004).",2004-04-15
"If the inflation risk premium averages 50 basis points, for example, then breakeven inflation will overstate the market's true expectation of inflation by half a percentage point, a substantial amount.",2004-04-15
A further complication is that inflation risk premiums are not constant but instead appear to vary over time as economic circumstances change.,2004-04-15
"Second, although the issuance of inflation-protected securities has risen significantly, the outstanding quantities of these securities remain much smaller than those of conventional Treasury securities.",2004-04-15
"All else equal, the likely presence of a liquidity premium in the TIPS return tends to make breakeven inflation an underestimate of expected inflation, thus offsetting to some degree the effect of the inflation risk premium.3 Like inflation risk premiums, liquidity premiums on TIPS appear to vary over time, further complicating the interpretation of breakeven inflation.",2004-04-15
"Hence, an indexed security typically has a longer duration with respect to real interest rate changes than does the nominal security, a difference that affects the relative riskiness of real and nominal securities.4 More generally, because TIPS returns are imperfectly correlated with the yields on both nominal Treasuries and stocks, some investors demand TIPS for general diversification purposes--a demand that appears to have increased significantly as investors have become more familiar with this new type of asset.",2004-04-15
"As the supply of TIPS has been fairly limited, the rise in demand by institutional investors and others may push down the equilibrium real return on TIPS and thus raise measures of breakeven inflation.5 A separate issue that bears on the relevance of breakeven inflation for policymaking is that TIPS returns depend on the overall consumer price index (CPI), whereas for many purposes policymakers are more interested in the behavior of core inflation, a measure of inflation that strips out volatile food and energy prices.",2004-04-15
"In fact, TIPS returns appear sensitive to fluctuations in oil prices.",2004-04-15
"As you can see in Figure 1, breakeven inflation rates have proven surprisingly volatile over their short history.",2004-04-15
"For example, when nominal Treasury yields swung sharply during the spring and summer of 2003, ten-year breakeven inflation moved sharply as well, declining about 40 basis points as the bond market rallied, then rising about 80 basis points when nominal yields came back up (top panel).",2004-04-15
"This effect was seen also in inflation compensation at the five-to-ten-year horizon (bottom panel), a rather counterintuitive result.",2004-04-15
What should we make of the volatility of breakeven inflation over recent years?,2004-04-15
"One interpretation is that inflation expectations are not as well anchored as policymakers would like (see Bernanke, 2004, for additional evidence on this point).",2004-04-15
"The fact that inflation compensation tends to react strongly both to releases of macroeconomic data and to unexpected changes in monetary policy (Gurkaynak, Sack, and Swanson, 2003) supports this interpretation.",2004-04-15
"Still, at this point I think we need to be cautious about drawing strong conclusions about the short-run behavior of expected inflation from the data on breakeven inflation.",2004-04-15
The fact that the volatility of breakeven inflation is so much greater than that of standard survey measures of inflation expectations (such as those collected by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia for professional forecasters or by the University of Michigan for consumers) should give us pause.,2004-04-15
"The responsiveness of breakeven inflation to what might be construed primarily as liquidity disturbances, such as the Russian debt crisis and recent bouts of mortgage hedging activity that roiled Treasury markets, suggests that variable liquidity premiums, together with varying inflation risk premiums, contaminate breakeven inflation as a measure of expected inflation.6 I have emphasized some reasons to be cautious in interpreting breakeven inflation as expected inflation.",2004-04-15
"Nevertheless, I expect that the usefulness of inflation-indexed securities as a tool for measuring expected inflation will increase over time.",2004-04-15
"The liquidity of TIPS should continue to improve as the share of government debt issued in inflation-linked form continues to rise, particularly if the Treasury decides to expand the range of maturities of indexed bonds that it offers.",2004-04-15
"Moreover, as I will discuss briefly later in the talk, our ability to model risk and liquidity premiums is improving, which will help us control for an important source of volatility in breakeven inflation.",2004-04-15
"Finally, the universe of inflation-linked financial assets seems to be increasing, which will allow for fruitful comparisons and cross-checking.",2004-04-15
"Although these contracts are not yet widely traded, they may at some point provide useful measures of breakeven inflation out to the maturity of the shortest-term TIPS, thereby filling in an important portion of the term structure of breakeven inflation.",2004-04-15
Interest Rates and Spreads as Leading Indicators An alternative approach to extracting information from financial markets is to examine a range of asset prices and yields to determine whether they are useful as leading indicators of economic developments.,2004-04-15
Financial prices meet several key criteria for being useful leading indicators.,2004-04-15
"As I already noted, asset prices and yields are inherently forward looking and thus may contain information about future economic conditions not evident in other series.",2004-04-15
"Moreover, asset prices, unlike many data series, are available on a timely and continuous basis and are not revised.",2004-04-15
"At least since the 1930s, when Wesley Mitchell and Arthur Burns (1938) published their pioneering work, economists have noted the usefulness of asset prices in forecasting economic activity--though perhaps we should keep in mind Paul Samuelson's wry observation that ""the stock market has predicted nine of the last five recessions.""",2004-04-15
"Although many financial quantities have been used in forecasting (an index of stock prices is included in the official index of leading indicators), interest rates on various financial instruments have perhaps been most often cited for their value as leading indicators.7 For example, in a 1992 paper, Alan Blinder and I found evidence that the federal funds rate, the short-term interest rate used by the Federal Reserve as its policy instrument, has significant predictive power for a variety of measures of economic activity.",2004-04-15
"Among these variables were the spread between the ten-year and one-year Treasury yields (the term spread), the yield differential between commercial paper and Treasury bills (the public-private spread), the change in the ten-year Treasury yields, and the nominal exchange rate.8 Thus, Stock and Watson found that two of the best seven macroeconomic forecasting variables were interest rate spreads, and four of the best seven forecasters were financial in nature.",2004-04-15
"To some extent, it captures the stance of monetary policy.",2004-04-15
"For example, when the yield curve is sharply upward sloping, as is the case today, one can usually conclude that monetary policy is in an expansionary mode (because the short-term policy rate lies below the average of expected future short-term rates).",2004-04-15
"Either an expected pickup in economic growth or higher expected future inflation would also tend to raise long-term rates relative to short rates, steepening the yield curve.",2004-04-15
"Evidence for the predictive power of the slope of the yield curve has been found for other industrialized countries as well as for the United States.9 Although the evident information content of the term spread and other yields and spreads is intriguing, these variables--like breakeven inflation--hardly provide a foolproof forecasting tool.",2004-04-15
"For example, the Stock-Watson indicator and other indicators based on interest rates and spreads signaled the 1990-91 recession very weakly and rather late.",2004-04-15
"For example, Ang, Piazzesi, and Wei (2003) have used modern financial theory to construct a model of the Treasury yield curve that closely links the behavior of real GDP and a few key interest rates.",2004-04-15
"In particular, their framework incorporates the possibility of two-way causality, allowing for both interest-rate effects on the economy and the impact of economic developments on interest rates.",2004-04-15
"These authors show that combining financial and macroeconomic elements in a single model permits better forecasts of both GDP and of interest rates than can be achieved through less formal methods.11 Other work, for example by Ang and Bekaert (2003), shows how modeling the links between interest rates and the economy may help us obtain more efficient forecasts of inflation.",2004-04-15
"Similarly, better estimates of inflation risk premiums would prove useful for adjusting breakeven inflation rates from TIPS to get more reliable measures of expected inflation.",2004-04-15
Market Expectations of Monetary Policy What do markets expect about the future course of monetary policy?,2004-04-15
"These contracts are traded in highly liquid markets.12 Moreover, by their nature they are closely tied to expectations of monetary policy changes, as both reflect rates paid in the interbank market, the market that is targeted by the Federal Reserve's open-market operations.13 Implied forward values of short-term interest rates at various horizons can be extracted from federal funds and eurodollar futures contract prices in a straightforward way.",2004-04-15
"As you probably know, the payroll employment numbers announced on April 2 significantly exceeded market expectations.",2004-04-15
Figure 3 shows that the payroll data seems to have caused the market to price in an expectation of a higher federal funds rate target over the entire policy horizon.,2004-04-15
"Of course, that change in policy expectations is consistent with the significant rise in Treasury yields that occurred after the employment report.",2004-04-15
"As with inflation-indexed securities, forward interest rates implied by futures contracts do not necessarily correspond to market expectations of the short-term rate, because of the presence of premiums for interest-rate risk.14 Indeed, research suggests that risk premiums in federal funds and eurodollar futures contracts are not trivial and may vary over time.",2004-04-15
"The implication is that, although futures prices provide good estimates of market expectations of policy at short horizons of six months or so, at longer horizons they can be misleading.",2004-04-15
"Once again, we see that some subtlety is required to extract the information available in asset prices.",2004-04-15
"The first type analyzes how various events, such as Federal Reserve statements; the release of minutes, testimony, or speeches by members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC); and macroeconomic news affect market expectations of monetary policy.",2004-04-15
"In particular, when the FOMC chooses to set the target for the federal funds rate at a value different from that expected by the market, asset prices tend to react strongly.",2004-04-15
"For example, in a recent paper, Kenneth Kuttner and I (2004) studied the effects on stock prices of unanticipated changes in monetary policy, as measured by settings of the federal funds rate target that differ from those implied by federal funds futures market.",2004-04-15
"We found that a surprise increase of 25 basis points in the funds rate target typically results in a decline in broad equity indexes of about 1 percent, whereas a change in the funds rate that is expected by the market has essentially no effect on stock prices.17 Our work is just one example of a number of event-study analyses that may well shed light on the effects of monetary policy and the channels of monetary policy transmission.",2004-04-15
"Policymakers are concerned not only about market expectations of output, inflation, interest rates, and other key variables, but also about the extent of market uncertainty about those and other variables.",2004-04-15
"For example, the Board's staff regularly analyzes the prices of options on eurodollar futures to estimate the degree of uncertainty that market participants have about monetary policy at different horizons.",2004-04-15
"Indeed, by examining options with different strike prices, and under some reasonable additional assumptions, one can produce a full probability distribution of market expectations for the level of the federal funds rate at various dates in the future.",2004-04-15
"Likewise, analysis of various types of options can generate distributions of expectations for economic and financial variables ranging from oil prices to the exchange value of the dollar to future stock prices.18 Conclusion Financial markets aggregate enormous amounts of information and thus provide a rich hunting ground for central bankers trying to learn about the economy.",2004-04-15
"I chose the following set: Why has the Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy now, given that economic growth has been robust for the last four years and there is no evidence that core inflation is beginning to rise?",2000-04-12
How could an increase in the underlying rate of productivity growth--an event that would appear to augur an increase in aggregate supply relative to aggregate demand--raise concerns about overheating and higher inflation?,2000-04-12
"Finally, does the fact that the five recent tightenings have resulted in very little evidence of slowing in the growth of demand indicate that monetary policy is less effective today than it used to be and, if so, why?",2000-04-12
"Before proceeding, let me remind you that the interpretation of the economic outlook and the judgments about the strategy of monetary policy I am presenting here are my own views.",2000-04-12
The Rationale for Monetary Policy Tightening: Why Now?,2000-04-12
"The rationale for monetary policy tightening is, in my judgment, quite straightforward and flows from two assessments about the current state of the economy.",2000-04-12
"First, aggregate demand has been growing faster than potential aggregate supply, even allowing for upward revisions to aggregate supply growth as a result of an acceleration in productivity.",2000-04-12
"Second, the level of output is already at least at potential (in other words, the economy is already at least at full employment) and, quite possibly, the economy is operating beyond the point of sustainable capacity.",2000-04-12
"But the key point is that, even though the rate of increase in nominal wages and core measures of inflation do not yet signal that inflation pressures are building, the balance of aggregate demand and sustainable supply today and the distinct possibility that labor and product markets will tighten further suggest an unacceptable risk of overheating and, therefore, higher inflation in the future.",2000-04-12
"The move to tighter monetary policy, beginning in mid-1999, seeks to rebalance aggregate demand and aggregate supply.",2000-04-12
"That promises to reduce the swing in interest rates that would otherwise be necessary later on and provides the best opportunity for containing inflation, extending the expansion, and yielding an overall more stable and more favorable outcome.",2000-04-12
The evidence is the consistent decline in the unemployment rate.,2000-04-12
"In a recent talk, I reviewed estimates of trend growth in potential output from surveys of professional forecasters and from model-based forecasting firms.",2000-04-12
These estimates all fell short of the more than 4 percent average growth rate of real GDP over the past four years and the 4½ percent rate over the past two years.,2000-04-12
"In the absence of an appropriate degree of tightening, I believe that this imbalance in the growth of demand and supply would persist.",2000-04-12
There is somewhat greater uncertainty about whether the economy is already operating beyond full employment.,2000-04-12
"Nevertheless, my survey also found that estimates of the nonaccelerating-inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) were consistently above the prevailing 4.1 percent unemployment rate, with estimates of the NAIRU centered close to 5 percent.",2000-04-12
"To date, there is little evidence that the rate of increase in unit labor costs or core measures of consumer price inflation are rising.",2000-04-12
"The core Consumer Price Index (CPI), for example, has advanced at a 2.1 percent rate over the past 12 months, only slightly above the lowest reading for this expansion.",2000-04-12
This makes clear that the recent tightening of monetary policy is pre-emptive--an attempt to prevent an unacceptable rise in core inflation--not a reaction to direct evidence of rising inflation.,2000-04-12
"Given the lags in monetary policy, such pre-emptive policy action is often essential to achieve favorable outcomes.",2000-04-12
"Monetary policy has, nevertheless, been adapting to heightened uncertainty about the rate of growth in potential and the size of the gap between actual and potential output.",2000-04-12
"But because there are still limits to how fast the economy can grow without further straining labor markets and to how low the unemployment rate can go without triggering higher inflation, there are limits to monetary policy's tolerance for above-trend growth and for further labor market tightening.",2000-04-12
The unemployment rate has been falling for the last four years.,2000-04-12
Core inflation remains well contained.,2000-04-12
"In my view, three developments suggest a greater risk of rising inflation going forward and hence justify the timing of the recent tightening moves.",2000-04-12
"First, the cumulative decline in the unemployment rate has, at the very least, pushed the economy closer to and, in my view, likely beyond the point of full employment.",2000-04-12
"The immediate threat of overheating from continued above-trend growth is, therefore, much greater today than previously.",2000-04-12
"Second, the growth in demand moved into a still higher gear in the second half of 1999 and recent data suggest considerable momentum in domestic demand in the first half of 2000, at the same time that the external drag from declining net exports is expected to diminish.",2000-04-12
"Third, some beneficial influences on inflation are abating or reversing: The effects of the earlier favorable relative-price shocks--including the decline in non-oil import prices and the slowdown in health care costs--are now dissipating or reversing; the temporary disinflationary effect of the increase in trend productivity growth is likely to diminish, a point I will elaborate on shortly; and the recent sharp rebound in oil prices is now pushing overall inflation higher.",2000-04-12
These developments give a sense of urgency to at least slowing the economy to trend growth and encourage increased vigilance in monitoring cost and price developments for signs of rising inflation.,2000-04-12
Productivity Shocks: Can They Be Inflationary?,2000-04-12
It has become abundantly clear that the star of the last several years has been the remarkable rebound in productivity growth.,2000-04-12
"Because higher growth of productivity translates mechanically into higher growth in potential output, it might seem that, by raising aggregate supply relative to aggregate demand, higher productivity growth would make the economy less susceptible to higher inflation.",2000-04-12
"So some have been puzzled by the Federal Reserve's appreciation of the importance of the increase in productivity growth, on the one hand, and the apparent concern with the threat of higher inflation, on the other hand.",2000-04-12
Some have even wondered whether the Federal Reserve believes that a higher productivity trend might actually be an adverse as opposed to a favorable development.,2000-04-12
Higher productivity is unambiguously good.,2000-04-12
"But the monetary policy that accompanies a productivity shock, on the other hand, could be good or bad.",2000-04-12
We are trying to combine the productivity shock with a monetary policy that reaps the full benefits of higher productivity growth and avoids turning what should be a favorable event into one that threatens higher inflation and greater economic instability over the longer haul.,2000-04-12
"Effects on Aggregate Demand, Inflation, and Real Interest Rates To conduct such a monetary policy, we must recognize that higher productivity growth has at least three major effects on the macro economy, in addition to its effect on sustainable growth rates.",2000-04-12
"It affects aggregate demand, inflation, and equilibrium real interest rates.",2000-04-12
Productivity and aggregate demand.,2000-04-12
Higher productivity growth has apparently increased aggregate demand through at least three channels.,2000-04-12
"First, the higher trend growth in productivity likely reflects, in part, technological innovations that have, in turn, resulted in new profitable investment opportunities.",2000-04-12
In this way higher productivity growth may spur an investment boom.,2000-04-12
"Second, the perceived enhancement in profit opportunities has contributed to an increase in business earnings expectations and, hence, higher equity prices.",2000-04-12
Higher equity prices have also reduced the cost of capital and reinforced the investment boom.,2000-04-12
"Finally, to the extent that households expect higher productivity growth to continue, their perceptions of the resulting higher path for future real compensation would further boost consumer spending today.",2000-04-12
The effect of increased wealth and expected future real compensation on holdings of consumer durables and other tangible assets today lead to accelerator-type effects that can be especially large contributors to aggregate demand.,2000-04-12
"Potentially, these three forces are powerful enough to cause the growth in aggregate demand initially to outpace the growth in aggregate supply, in the absence of any offsetting tightening in the stance of monetary policy.",2000-04-12
"In fact, as I noted earlier, it appears that the growth in aggregate demand has been exceeding the upward-revised estimate of the growth in aggregate supply over the last few years.",2000-04-12
The linkages I have described from higher productivity growth to more robust growth in aggregate demand are one possible explanation for this imbalance.,2000-04-12
But this explanation is less important than the conclusion that we are on the mark in perceiving an imbalance in the growth rates of demand and supply.,2000-04-12
"The FRB-US model, developed at the Board of Governors, gives some credibility to the linkages that I have highlighted between productivity and aggregate demand.",2000-04-12
"When the assumed productivity trend is raised in this model, the near-term effect on aggregate demand exceeds the initial effect on aggregate supply, as long as households and firms recognize that there has been a sustained shift in growth.",2000-04-12
The temporary disinflationary effect of an unexpected increase in the productivity trend.,2000-04-12
"In the long run, inflation is a monetary phenomenon and independent of the rate of productivity growth.",2000-04-12
"In the short-run, on the other hand, an unexpected increase in trend productivity growth can yield a disinflationary bonus for a while.",2000-04-12
The source of the disinflationary effect in the last few years has clearly not been that aggregate supply is growing faster than aggregate demand.,2000-04-12
"Instead the source, in my view, is an asymmetric response of nominal wages and prices to the productivity shock.",2000-04-12
"If wages adjust more slowly to an unexpected increase in productivity growth than prices, the initial effect of higher productivity growth will be a decline in the growth of unit labor costs and in price inflation.",2000-04-12
"For a time, lower price increases feed back into reduced pressure on nominal wages.",2000-04-12
But once wages fully respond to the higher productivity trend--a process that appears to take several years to complete--the disinflationary effect of the productivity shock will dissipate.,2000-04-12
"In the interim, for any given unemployment rate, inflation will be lower than otherwise, and, as a result, the economy can operate at a lower unemployment rate without adverse inflationary consequences for a period of time.",2000-04-12
"Therefore, despite a decline in the unemployment rate, there may be little urgency for an increase in nominal interest rates.",2000-04-12
Productivity and the equilibrium real interest rate.,2000-04-12
An increase in the trend rate of productivity growth will also generally result in a higher equilibrium real interest rate.,2000-04-12
"Classical economic theory holds that the economy's equilibrium real interest rate is determined by the interaction of ""productivity"" and ""thrift.""",2000-04-12
"That is, the equilibrium real interest rate at full employment has to balance saving (driven by the thrift motive) and investment (responding to the productivity and, hence, profitability of capital).",2000-04-12
"Higher productivity growth increases the profitability of investment, increasing the demand for investment, and, hence, the equilibrium real interest rate that balances saving and investment at full employment.",2000-04-12
This is really an implication of the earlier discussion of the effect of a productivity shock on aggregate demand relative to aggregate supply.,2000-04-12
"A variety of models suggest that, under reasonable assumptions, the increase in the equilibrium real interest rate is at least one-for-one with the pick-up in the economy's growth rate.",2000-04-12
"A useful way of understanding the effect of productivity on the balance between aggregate demand and supply is in terms of the relationship between ""natural"" and ""market"" rates--a relationship Knut Wicksell put at the center of his analysis.",2000-04-12
The natural rate is the equilibrium real interest rate that I described above.,2000-04-12
The market rate is the actual (real) interest rate determined in financial markets and affected by monetary policy as well as by the balance between saving and investment.,2000-04-12
"When the market rate is below the natural rate, financial conditions are relatively stimulative and aggregate demand will be boosted to a level above potential aggregate supply.",2000-04-12
This analysis makes clear that the effect of a productivity shock on the balance between aggregate demand and supply depends critically on the monetary policy that accompanies it.,2000-04-12
"Of course, to keep market rates in line with the natural rate, we must make some judgments about the degree to which the equilibrium real interest rate is affected by an increase in productivity growth.",2000-04-12
"This depends on, in addition to the size of the increment in productivity growth, a number of other considerations.",2000-04-12
"For example, the change in the equilibrium real interest rate will also depend on the prevailing fiscal policy.",2000-04-12
"If nominal spending or even real government spending is fixed, on the other hand, a productivity shock increases the government budget surplus relative to GDP, at least partially offsetting the rise in the equilibrium real interest rate.",2000-04-12
The full effect on the equilibrium real interest rate holds when the productivity shock symmetrically affects foreign as well as domestic output growth.,2000-04-12
"If the productivity shock raises the growth rate only or predominantly in the United States, the resulting international capital flows to the United States in search of higher expected rates of return will damp the effect of the productivity shock on our equilibrium real interest rate.",2000-04-12
"As a result of the variety of effects on the equilibrium real interest rate in this episode, it takes some careful analysis to assess whether and how much the real equilibrium interest rate may have increased.",2000-04-12
"The observed strength of aggregate demand relative to aggregate supply, however, does importantly reinforce the judgment that the natural rate has indeed increased.",2000-04-12
Monetary Policy and Productivity Shocks The effect of a productivity shock on the balance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply (or equivalently on the balance between natural and market rates) depends importantly on the conduct of monetary policy.,2000-04-12
"Therefore, whether inflation turns out to be higher, lower, or unchanged in response to the productivity shock--especially once the initial disinflationary impetus dissipates--depends on the conduct of monetary policy and should not be attributed to the productivity shock itself.",2000-04-12
"In simulations with the FRB-US model, for example, aggregate demand increases faster than aggregate supply if the nominal federal funds rate is held constant or if monetary policy is assumed to follow a Taylor Rule and when households and firms are assumed to fairly quickly recognize the sharp step-up in productivity growth.",2000-04-12
The Taylor rule prescribes adjustments in the real federal funds rate in response to deviations of output from potential and inflation from some target rate.,2000-04-12
This formulation of policy yields something very close to an unchanged nominal funds rate path during the first couple of years following an increase in productivity growth.,2000-04-12
The decline in inflation raises the real federal funds rate just about as much as the Taylor Rule prescribes in light of the increase in the output gap.,2000-04-12
"Later, however, as the disinflationary force of the productivity shock dissipates, the Taylor Rule will cause increases in nominal and real interest rates that push output toward potential and contain inflation.",2000-04-12
Monetary policy could use such a shock as an opportunity to temporarily move below the unemployment rate sustainable in the long run while keeping the inflation rate unchanged.,2000-04-12
"Alternatively, monetary policy could convert the temporary disinflationary effect into a permanent one.",2000-04-12
"This would be an example of ""opportunistic disinflation"": monetary policy could take advantage of a disinflationary surprise to lower inflation without a temporary increase in the unemployment rate.",2000-04-12
"If inflation is low at the time of the shock, the incentive is great to take the benefits in a temporary decline in the unemployment rate.",2000-04-12
"Of course, policymakers could also choose a bit of both of these options, and I would interpret monetary policy as having produced this middle course during the last several years.",2000-04-12
The task of monetary policy going forward is to avoid transforming what could have been an opportunity to lower the underlying inflation rate into a balance of risks that threatens to raise inflation relative to the rate prevailing at the beginning of this episode.,2000-04-12
Is Monetary Policy Less Effective Today?,2000-04-12
"The recent increases in the federal funds rate do not appear, to date, to have slowed the momentum in demand growth.",2000-04-12
"Indeed, as I noted earlier, the economy appears to have shifted into a still higher gear just as monetary policy turned more restrictive.",2000-04-12
"As a result, some have wondered whether recent structural changes may have undermined the effectiveness of monetary policy.",2000-04-12
It is well appreciated that monetary policy affects aggregate demand with long and variable lags.,2000-04-12
"So, a limited initial effect of tighter monetary policy on demand is to be expected.",2000-04-12
"In addition, the first three quarter-point moves simply reversed the earlier cumulative easing, which may have added to demand in the second half of 1999.",2000-04-12
"So the modest effects on aggregate demand to date perhaps only confirm the relatively modest and extremely gradual nature of the current tightening, along with the usual lags.",2000-04-12
"In addition, some developments suggest that the recent policy moves may have had a more limited effect on aggregate demand than would have been expected from even this modest increase in the federal funds rate.",2000-04-12
The key to understanding the effects of monetary policy on aggregate demand is that monetary policy does not operate through the direct effect of the federal funds rate on aggregate demand.,2000-04-12
"Instead, changes in the federal funds rate and anticipations of future movements in the funds rate affect aggregate demand via their influence on a broader range of financial conditions, including short and longer-term private interest rates, equity prices, and the real exchange rate.",2000-04-12
"Financial conditions indexes that capture in one measure the full range of relevant interest rates, asset prices, and exchange rates have been constructed by Goldman Sachs and Macroeconomic Advisers.",2000-04-12
"So a second conclusion about the current experience is that the increase in the funds rate, to date, has had a smaller effect than usual--nearly zero--on overall financial conditions and hence on aggregate demand.",2000-04-12
"The apparent persistence of accommodative overall financial conditions in the face of the recent increases in the federal funds rate is principally due to the continued increase, on balance, of equity prices and the failure of the real exchange rate to appreciate further.",2000-04-12
"Figure 3 confirms that equity prices have been unusually resilient in this episode, rising by an amount near the maximum during the first nine months of significant tightenings over the period studied.",2000-04-12
Private long-term interest rates will rise further only if market participants come to believe that the Federal Reserve will tighten by more than the couple of additional moves already embedded in the yield curve or if inflation expectations begin to rise.,2000-04-12
"The fact that long-term private rates had already risen in anticipation of further Fed tightening has shortened the lag from increases in the federal funds rate to the ultimate effect on aggregate demand relative to past experience and thereby has actually added to, rather than subtracted from, the effectiveness of monetary policy.",2000-04-12
"No one channel of monetary policy--in terms of the financial conditions index, no one component--should be singled out as of controlling importance.",2000-04-12
"Still, monetary policy must take into account the overall response of financial conditions in judging the appropriate magnitude of any cumulative change in the federal funds rate.",2000-04-12
"There also has been concern that some sectors of the economy--specifically investment in high-tech equipment, a component that has been an important contributor to the strength of aggregate demand--may be relatively insensitive to higher interest rates, therefore reducing the overall response to higher interest rates in this episode of policy tightening.",2000-04-12
"The housing sector has often borne a disproportionate burden of higher interest rates, at least initially.",2000-04-12
But the reality is that monetary policy always has had uneven effects across the economy.,2000-04-12
"We have a single instrument that, by necessity, must be used to achieve balance between aggregate demand and potential aggregate supply.",2000-04-12
Variations in sectoral responses will be unavoidable given the different lags and different interest sensitivities of the various components of aggregate demand.,2000-04-12
"Another often-asked question about monetary policy is whether, once a decision is made to correct emerging imbalances, policy should move gradually or more forcefully.",2000-04-12
"But when considerable uncertainty remains about the appropriate course and aggressiveness of the policy response--especially when policy is moving pre-emptively against the threat of higher inflation, without any direct corroboration from data on inflation--a more gradualist approach allows policymakers to assess the data along the way and adjust accordingly the desired path of interest rates.",2000-04-12
The risk in this approach is that imbalances become larger and more disruptive to correct if resource utilization tightens further or inflation expectations pick up.,2000-04-12
The appropriate speed of adjustment might also depend on the degree to which the bond markets reflect policymakers' expectations about likely further increases in short-term interest rates.,2000-04-12
"That is, it may be more appropriate to move short-term interest rates slowly when long-term interest rates have already adjusted by an amount that policymakers believe is sufficient to achieve their objectives.",2000-04-12
Conclusion The combination of favorable relative-price and productivity shocks in this expansion are the principal sources of the exceptional combination of robust output growth and declining unemployment on the one hand and stable to declining inflation on the other hand.,2000-04-12
"As the disinflationary effects of relative-price shocks and faster productivity growth dissipate, monetary policy must be prepared to deal with more traditional concerns about the balance between growth of demand and supply, the relationship between output and potential, and the danger of overheating.",2000-04-12
"As these concerns have become more pressing, monetary policy has responded in an effort to rebalance aggregate demand and supply and contain the risk of higher inflation.",2000-04-12
A productivity shock is unambiguously good.,2000-04-12
But the monetary policy that accompanies it can be good or bad.,2000-04-12
"A good monetary policy is one that allows the economy to realize the full benefits of the higher growth while respecting the fact that limits--albeit new ones--remain and that, if exceeded, the ultimate result will be rising inflation, threatening the sustainability of the expansion.",2000-04-12
Monetary policy remains fully capable of getting the job done.,2000-04-12
Policymakers have to adjust the timing and cumulative size of tightenings to ensure that the effect on overall financial conditions will promote a continuation of this economic expansion and an accompanying low and stable rate of inflation.,2000-04-12
"To date, despite a current account deficit exceeding 6 percent of our gross domestic product (GDP), we--or more exactly, the economic entities that comprise the U.S. economy--are experiencing few difficulties in attracting the foreign saving required to finance it, as evidenced by the recent upward pressure on the dollar.",2005-11-14
"The markets are not behaving in the way that some, if not most, analysts anticipated as the U.S. current account deficit rose above its previous high of 3-1/2 percent of GDP recorded in 1986.",2005-11-14
"Of course, deficits that cumulate to ever-increasing net external debt, with its attendant rise in servicing costs, cannot persist indefinitely.",2005-11-14
"Even if such returns on U.S. assets stay high, the rise of concentration risks in foreign official and private portfolios could still induce investors to slow their accumulation of dollar claims and thereby delimit the size of the financeable U.S. current account deficit.",2005-11-14
"The outcome encompasses the full array of domestic and international product and asset prices, including interest rates.",2005-11-14
"The array of bilateral exchange rates between the dollar and foreign currencies appears to be particularly important to the current account balance, although, of course, exchange rates, like all other prices, are determined interactively and simultaneously.",2005-11-14
"To the extent that an economy harbors elements of inflexibility, so that prices and quantities are slow to respond to new developments, the deficit-adjustment process is likely to adversely affect the levels of output and employment.",2005-11-14
A nation's current account balance thus is essentially a market phenomenon that is not readily subject to rebalance by targeting one or more policy variables such as the exchange rate.,2005-11-14
"To be sure, if the exchange rate of the dollar, through intervention, is persistently pressed higher or lower, the whole set of previously noted relationships would shift accordingly.",2005-11-14
"To be sure, policy initiatives to increase interest rates, which would elevate the propensity of households to save, would reduce the need for domestic investment to be financed by borrowed foreign saving.",2005-11-14
"However, the additional inflow of capital arising from higher U.S. interest rates would boost the dollar's value and offset the narrowing of the imbalance.",2005-11-14
"Alternatively, a discretionary reduction in our federal budget deficit would work toward narrowing the current account deficit but, if history is any judge, to an uncertain and possibly small extent.",2005-11-14
The rise of our deficit and our ability to finance it appears to coincide with a pronounced new phase of globalization that has emerged in the past decade.,2005-11-14
"This phase is characterized by a major acceleration in U.S. productivity growth and the decline in what economists call home bias, the parochial tendency to invest domestic savings in one's home country.",2005-11-14
"Greater rates of productivity growth in the United States, compared with still-subdued rates abroad, have apparently engendered comparable differences in risk-adjusted expected rates of return and hence in the demand for U.S.-based investment assets.",2005-11-14
"Only in the past decade has expanding trade been associated with the emergence of ever-larger U.S. trade and current account deficits, matched by a corresponding widening of the aggregate external surpluses of many of our trading partners.",2005-11-14
"Indeed, all of these factors working simultaneously determine the extent to which domestic savers successfully reach beyond their borders to, on net, invest in foreign assets and thereby create current account surpluses and deficits.",2005-11-14
"That ex post relationship, the correlation between actual--instead of intended--domestic saving and domestic investment was the object of the seminal work by Feldstein and Horioka a quarter century ago.4 Without the evident worldwide fall in home bias over the past decade, noted earlier, the United States would not have been able to finance its recent current account deficits, and, accordingly, these deficits would have been smaller.",2005-11-14
"In recent years, the negative tail of the distribution of current account balances has been, of course, dominated by the U.S. deficit.",2005-11-14
"Given that we have yet to experience difficulties in funding a current account deficit that exceeds 6 percent of our GDP, what are the limits to the foreign markets' absorption of claims on U.S. residents?",2005-11-14
Funding of our current account deficit likely will become more difficult when home bias approaches its practical minimum.,2005-11-14
"Presumably, well before the practical lower limits of home bias are reached, effective constraints on deficit funding, and hence on the deficit itself, are likely to come from foreign investors' fear of portfolio concentrations of claims on the residents and government of the United States.",2005-11-14
"Adjusting for exchange rate changes, the dollar's share was 4 percentage points less than three years earlier, and the euro's share was more than 5 percentage points greater.6 Monetary authorities have been somewhat more inclined to hold dollar obligations.",2005-11-14
"Since early 2002, the dollar's share has been little changed after adjusting for movements in exchange rates.",2005-11-14
Most analysts would contend that U.S. interest rates were lowered by the world's accumulation of dollars.,2005-11-14
"Accordingly, in the event of a significant diminishing of the dollar's reserve currency status, U.S. interest rates would presumably rise.",2005-11-14
"Most recently, the flexibility of our market-driven economy has allowed us, thus far, to weather reasonably well the steep rise in spot and futures prices for oil and natural gas that we have experienced over the past two years.",2005-11-14
"The net effect, to the surprise of most, has been what appears to be a decline in the structural unemployment rate in the United States over the past quarter century.",2005-11-14
"At the Fed, we like to say that monetary policy is data dependent.",2019-10-08
"We must sort out in real time, as best we can, what the profound changes underway in the economy mean for issues such as the functioning of labor markets, the pace of productivity growth, and the forces driving inflation.",2019-10-08
"I will then turn to three challenges our dynamic economy is posing for policy at present: First, what would the consequences of a sharp rise in the price of oil be for the U.S. economy?",2019-10-08
"Second, with terabytes of data increasingly competing with truckloads of goods in economic importance, what are the best ways to measure output and productivity?",2019-10-08
"Put more provocatively, might the recent productivity slowdown be an artifact of antiquated measurement?",2019-10-08
"Given our mandate of maximum employment and price stability, this question is at the very core of our work.",2019-10-08
I will discuss how we are using big data to improve our grasp of the job market in the face of such revisions.,2019-10-08
"After exploring them, I will comment briefly on recent developments in money markets and on monetary policy.",2019-10-08
"World War I was breaking out in Europe, and over the next four years the war would fuel profound growth and transformation in the U.S. economy.1 But you could not have seen this change in the gross national product data; the Department of Commerce did not publish those until 1942.",2019-10-08
What Are the Consequences of an Oil Price Spike?,2019-10-08
Let's turn now to the first question of the consequences of an oil price spike.,2019-10-08
"Since then, remarkable advances in the technology for finding and extracting oil have led to a rapid increase in production to levels higher than ever before.3 In 2018, the United States became the world's largest oil producer.4 Oil exports have surged, imports have fallen (figure 2), and the U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that this month, for the first time in many decades, the United States will be a net exporter of oil.5 As monetary policymakers, we closely monitor developments in oil markets because disruptions in these markets have played a role in several U.S. recessions and in the Great Inflation of the 1960s and 1970s.",2019-10-08
"Traditionally, we assessed that a sharp rise in the price of oil would have a strong negative effect on consumers and businesses and, hence, on the U.S. economy.",2019-10-08
"Today a higher oil price would still cause dislocations and hardship for many, but with exports and imports nearly balanced, the higher price paid by consumers is roughly offset by higher earnings of workers and firms in the U.S. oil industry.",2019-10-08
"Moreover, because it is now easier to ramp up oil production, a sustained price rise can quickly boost output, providing a shock absorber in the face of supply disruptions.",2019-10-08
"Thus, setting aside the effects of geopolitical uncertainty that may accompany higher oil prices, we now judge that a price spike would likely have nearly offsetting effects on U.S. gross domestic product (GDP).",2019-10-08
How Should We Measure Output and Productivity?,2019-10-08
Let's now turn to the second question of how to best measure output and productivity.,2019-10-08
"In 1987, Nobel Prizeâ€“winning economist Robert Solow quipped that ""you can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.",2019-10-08
"""6 In the second half of the 1990s, this measurement puzzle was at the heart of monetary policymaking.7 Chairman Alan Greenspan famously argued that the United States was experiencing the dawn of a new economy, and that potential and actual output were likely understated in official statistics.",2019-10-08
"Where others saw capacity constraints and incipient inflation, Greenspan saw a productivity boom that would leave room for very low unemployment without inflation pressures.",2019-10-08
"In light of the uncertainty it faced, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) judged that the appropriate riskâ€‘management approach called for refraining from interest rate increases unless and until there were clearer signs of rising inflation.",2019-10-08
"Under this policy, unemployment fell near record lows without rising inflation, and later revisions to GDP measurement showed appreciably faster productivity growth.8 This episode illustrates a key challenge to making data-dependent policy in real time: Good decisions require good data, but the data in hand are seldom as good as we would like.",2019-10-08
Productivity is again presenting a puzzle.,2019-10-08
"Official statistics currently show productivity growth slowing significantly in recent years, with the growth in output per hour worked falling from more than 3 percent a year from 1995 to 2003 to less than half that pace since then.9 Analysts are actively debating three alternative explanations for this apparent slowdown: First, the slowdown may be real and may persist indefinitely as productivity growth returns to moreâ€‘normal levels after a brief golden age.10 Second, the slowdown may instead be a pause of the sort that often accompanies fundamental technological change, so that productivity gains from recent technology advances will appear over time as society adjusts.11 Third, the slowdown may be overstated, perhaps greatly, because of measurement issues akin to those at work in the 1990s.12 At this point, we cannot know which of these views may gain widespread acceptance, and monetary policy will play no significant role in how this puzzle is resolved.",2019-10-08
"As in the late 1990s, however, we are carefully assessing the implications of possibly mismeasured productivity gains.",2019-10-08
"Moreover, productivity growth seems to have moved up over the past year after a long period at very low levels; we do not know whether that welcome trend will be sustained.",2019-10-08
Recent research suggests that current official statistics may understate productivity growth by missing a significant part of the growing value we derive from fast internet connections and smartphones.,2019-10-08
"And, adding to the measurement challenge, many of these services are free, which is to say, not explicitly priced.",2019-10-08
"Researchers have tried to answer these questions in various ways.13 For example, Fed researchers have recently proposed a novel approach to measuring the value of services consumers derive from cellphones and other devices based on the volume of data flowing over those connections.14 Taking their accounting at face value, GDP growth would have been about 1/2 percentage point higher since 2007, which is an appreciable change and would be very good news.",2019-10-08
"Growth over the previous couple of decades would also have been about 1/4 percentage point higher as well, implying that measurement issues of this sort likely account for only part of the productivity slowdown in current statistics.",2019-10-08
Let me now turn from the measurement issues raised by the information age to an issue that has long been at the center of monetary policymaking: How tight is the labor market?,2019-10-08
Answering this question is central to our outlook for both of our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability.,2019-10-08
"Until recently, the official data showed job gains over the year through March 2019 of about 210,000 a month, which is far higher than necessary to absorb new entrants into the labor force and thus hold the unemployment rate constant.",2019-10-08
"Several years ago, we began a collaboration with the payroll processing firm ADP to construct a measure of payroll employment from their data set, which covers about 20 percent of the nation's private workforce and is available to us with a roughly one-week delay.15 As described in a recent research paper, we constructed a measure that provides an independent read on payroll employment that complements the official statistics.16 While experience is still limited with the new measure, we find promising evidence that it can refine our real-time picture of job gains.",2019-10-08
"For example, in the first eight months of 2008, as the Great Recession was getting underway, the official monthly employment data showed total job losses of about 750,000 (figure 4).",2019-10-08
"Our new measure, had it been available in 2008, would have been much closer to the revised data, alerting us that the job situation might be considerably worse than the official data suggested.17 We believe that the new measure may help us better understand job market conditions in real time.",2019-10-08
"The preview of the BLS benchmark revision leaves average job gains over the year through March solidly above the pace required to accommodate growth in the workforce over that time, but where we had seen a booming job market, we now see more-moderate growth.",2019-10-08
"Of course, the pace of job gains is only one of many job market issues that figure into our assessment of how the economy is performing relative to our maximum-employment mandate and our assessment of any inflationary pressures arising in the job market.",2019-10-08
"Before wrapping up, I will discuss recent developments in money markets and the current stance of monetary policy.",2019-10-08
Our influence on the financial conditions that affect employment and inflation is indirect.,2019-10-08
The Federal Reserve sets two overnight interest rates: the interest rate paid on banks' reserve balances and the rate on our reverse repurchase agreements.,2019-10-08
"Overnight interest rates spiked, and the effective federal funds rate briefly moved above the FOMC's target range.",2019-10-08
"While a range of factors may have contributed to these developments, it is clear that without a sufficient quantity of reserves in the banking system, even routine increases in funding pressures can lead to outsized movements in money market interest rates.",2019-10-08
"This volatility can impede the effective implementation of monetary policy, and we are addressing it.",2019-10-08
"Consistent with a decision we made in January, our goal is to provide an ample supply of reserves to ensure that control of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily by setting our administered rates and not through frequent market interventions.",2019-10-08
"Reserve balances are one among several items on the liability side of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, and demand for these liabilitiesâ€”notably, currency in circulationâ€”grows over time.",2019-10-08
I want to emphasize that growth of our balance sheet for reserve management purposes should in no way be confused with the large-scale asset purchase programs that we deployed after the financial crisis.,2019-10-08
"Neither the recent technical issues nor the purchases of Treasury bills we are contemplating to resolve them should materially affect the stance of monetary policy, to which I now turn.",2019-10-08
"Our goal in monetary policy is to promote maximum employment and stable prices, which we interpret as inflation running closely around our symmetric 2 percent objective.",2019-10-08
"At present, the jobs and inflation pictures are favorable.",2019-10-08
"Many indicators show a historically strong labor market, with solid job gains, the unemployment rate at half-century lows, and rising prime-age labor force participation.",2019-10-08
Inflation is somewhat below our symmetric 2 percent objective but has been gradually firming over the past few months.,2019-10-08
"FOMC participants continue to see a sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective as most likely.",2019-10-08
"Growth around much of the world has weakened over the past year and a half, and uncertainties around trade, Brexit, and other issues pose risks to the outlook.",2019-10-08
"As those factors have evolved, my colleagues and I have shifted our views about appropriate monetary policy toward a lower path for the federal funds rate and have lowered its target range by 50 basis points.",2019-10-08
"As we move closer to price stability, the necessity of measuring prices accurately has become an especial challenge.",1997-11-07
Biases of a few tenths in annual inflation rates do not matter when inflation is high.,1997-11-07
"They do matter when, as now, a debate has emerged over whether our economies are moving toward price deflation.",1997-11-07
"In today's advanced economies, allocative decisions are primarily made not by governments but by markets, and the central guide to the efficient allocation of resources in a market economy is prices.",1997-11-07
"Prices are the signals through which tastes and technology affect the decisions of consumers and producers, directing resources toward their highest valued use.",1997-11-07
"Of course, this signaling process would work with or without government statistical agencies that measure individual and aggregate price levels, and in this sense, price measurement probably is not fundamental for the overall efficiency of the market economy.",1997-11-07
"Indeed, vibrant market economies existed long before government agencies were established to measure prices.",1997-11-07
"Nonetheless, in a modern monetary economy, accurate price measurement is of considerable importance, increasingly so for central banks whose mandate is to maintain financial stability.",1997-11-07
"Accurate price measures are necessary for understanding economic developments, not only involving inflation but also involving real output and productivity.",1997-11-07
"If the general price level is estimated to be rising more rapidly than is in fact the case, then we are simultaneously understating growth in real output and productivity.",1997-11-07
"Under these circumstances, policymakers must be cognizant of the shortcomings of our published price indexes to avoid misguided actions that will provoke unintended consequences.",1997-11-07
"Clearly, central bankers need to be conscious of the problems of price measurement as we gauge policies designed to promote price stability and maximum sustainable economic growth.",1997-11-07
"Moreover, many economic transactions, both private and public, are explicitly tied to movements in some published price index, most commonly a consumer price index; and some transactions that are not explicitly tied to a published price index may nevertheless take such an index into account less formally.",1997-11-07
"If the price index is not accurately measuring what the participants in such transactions believe it is measuring, then economic transactions will be skewed.",1997-11-07
"The measured price indexes have played an especially prominent role in Germany, both in terms of public perceptions of inflation performance and as a guide for policymakers.",1997-11-07
The Bundesbank's long-standing commitment to price stability and the public's support for that commitment derive at least to some extent from Germany's experiences with hyperinflation earlier this century.,1997-11-07
"Given this experience with the devastation that such inflation can bring to the economy and to people's lives, it comes as no surprise that your public and your policymakers give such careful scrutiny to the available measures of inflation.",1997-11-07
Germany has a reputation for special vigilance in guarding the stability of the price level and has achieved an admirable record of success in maintaining low inflation over the postwar period.,1997-11-07
"From the standpoint of monetary policy, this very success makes accurate price measurement all the more important.",1997-11-07
"When measured inflation is high, we can be confident that the proper direction of monetary policy is to bring inflation lower.",1997-11-07
"But when measured inflation is low, the proper direction of monetary policy, as I indicated, could depend crucially on the accuracy of those measurements.",1997-11-07
"The importance of accurate price measurement was particularly apparent during unification, when it became necessary to gauge productivity in East and West Germany on a comparable basis.",1997-11-07
"Initial estimates of East German productivity relative to that of the West were considerably higher than later, more accurate estimates showed to be the case.",1997-11-07
"These differences, we are told, owed largely to the difficulties in adjusting the prices of East German products to take into account that they were, on average, of lower quality than the equivalent items produced in the West.",1997-11-07
"In thinking about the problems of price measurement, a distinction must be made between the measurement of individual prices, on the one hand, and the aggregation of those prices into indexes of the overall price level, on the other.",1997-11-07
"The notion of what we mean by a general price level--or more relevantly, its change--is never unambiguously defined.",1997-11-07
"Moreover, in practice, aggregation can be complicated because standard price indexes frequently assume that individuals and businesses purchase the same basket of goods and services over time--whereas, in fact, people substitute some goods for others when relative prices change and as new goods are introduced.",1997-11-07
"How one aggregates individual prices, of course, depends on the purpose of the measure.",1997-11-07
"It is the measurement of individual prices, not the aggregation of those prices, that is so difficult conceptually.",1997-11-07
"At first glance, observing and measuring prices might not appear especially daunting.",1997-11-07
"After all, prices are at the center of virtually all economic transactions.",1997-11-07
But dividing that nominal value change into components representing changes in real quantity versus price requires that one define a unit of output that is to remain constant over time.,1997-11-07
Defining such a constant-quality unit of output is the central conceptual difficulty in price measurement.,1997-11-07
"Such a definition may be clear for unalloyed aluminium ingot of 99.7 percent purity for the vast proportion of transactions; consequently, its price can be compared over time with a degree of precision adequate for virtually all producers and consumers of aluminium ingot.",1997-11-07
"Similarly, the prices of a ton of cold rolled steel sheet, or of a linear meter of cotton broad woven fabric, can be reasonably compared over a period of years.",1997-11-07
"But when the characteristics of products and services are changing rapidly, defining the unit of output, and thereby adjusting an item's price for improvements in quality, can be exceptionally difficult.",1997-11-07
"These problems are becoming pervasive in modern economies as service prices, which are generally more difficult to measure, become more prominent in aggregate price measures.",1997-11-07
The continual introduction of new goods and services onto the markets creates special challenges for price measurement.,1997-11-07
"The area of medical care, where technology is changing in ways that make techniques of only a decade ago seem archaic, provides some particularly striking illustrations of the difficulties involved in measuring quality-adjusted prices.",1997-11-07
"How, then, will we measure inflation in the future if our measurement techniques become increasingly obsolete?",1997-11-07
"We must keep in mind that, difficult as the problem seems, consistently measured prices do exist in principle.",1997-11-07
"Embodied in all products is some unit of output, and hence of price, that is recognizable to those who buy and sell the product if not to the outside observer.",1997-11-07
"Furthermore, so long as people continue to exchange nominal interest rate debt instruments and contract for future payments in terms of dollars or other currencies, there must be a presumption about the future purchasing power of money no matter how complex individual products become.",1997-11-07
"Market participants do have a sense of the aggregate price level and how they expect it to change over time, and these views must be embedded in the value of financial assets.",1997-11-07
"The emergence of inflation-indexed bonds, while providing us with useful information, does not solve the problem of ascertaining an economically meaningful measure of the general price level.",1997-11-07
"By necessity, the total return on indexed bonds must be tied to forecasts of specific published price indexes, which may or may not reflect the market's judgment of the future purchasing power of money.",1997-11-07
"To the extent they do not, of course, the implicit real interest rate is biased in the opposite direction.",1997-11-07
"Moreover, we are, as yet, unable to separate compensation for inflation risk from compensation for expected inflation.",1997-11-07
"Eventually, financial markets may develop the instruments and associated analytical techniques for unearthing these implicit changes in the price level with some precision.",1997-11-07
"In those circumstances, then--at least for purposes of monetary policy--these measures could obviate the more traditional approaches to aggregate price measurement now employed.",1997-11-07
"They may help us understand, for example, whether markets perceive the true change in aggregate prices to reflect fixed or variable weight indexes of the components or whether arithmetic or logarithmic weighting of the components is more appropriate.",1997-11-07
"But, for the foreseeable future, we shall have to rely on our statistical agencies to produce the price data necessary to assess economic performance and to make economic policy.",1997-11-07
This technique associates changes in a product's price with changes in product characteristics.,1997-11-07
"In the United States, prior to the mid-1980s, computer prices simply were held constant in the national accounts.",1997-11-07
"Now, with the introduction of hedonic techniques, the accounts show computer prices declining at double-digit rates, surely a more accurate estimate of the true quality-adjusted price change.",1997-11-07
The few other countries that have introduced these techniques--France being the most recent--show computer prices declining much more rapidly than in the majority of countries that have not yet done so.,1997-11-07
The issues surrounding the appropriate measurement of computer prices also illustrate some of the difficulties of valuing goods and services when there are significant interactions among users of the products.,1997-11-07
"Therefore, even in the case of personal computers, where we have made such great strides in measuring quality changes, I suspect that important phenomena still may not be adequately captured by our published price indexes.",1997-11-07
"Despite the advances in price measurement that have been made over the years, there remains considerable room for improvement.",1997-11-07
"In the United States, a group of experts empaneled by the Senate Finance Committee--the Boskin commission--concluded that the consumer price index has overstated changes in the cost of living by roughly one percentage point per annum in recent years.",1997-11-07
"About half of this bias owed to inadequate adjustment for quality improvement and the introduction of new goods, and about half reflected the manner in which the individual prices were aggregated.",1997-11-07
"Recent work by staff economists at the Federal Reserve Board has added corroborating evidence of price mismeasurement, using a macroeconomic approach that is essentially independent of the microstatistical exercises.",1997-11-07
"Specifically, employing disaggregated data from the national income and product accounts, this research finds that the measured growth of real output and productivity in the service sector is implausibly weak, given that the return to owners of businesses in that sector apparently has been well-maintained.",1997-11-07
Much more reasonable is the view that prices have been mismeasured and that the true quality-adjusted prices have been rising more slowly than the published price indexes.,1997-11-07
"Properly measured, output and productivity trends in these service industries might be considerably stronger than suggested by the published data.",1997-11-07
"Assuming, for example, no change in productivity for these industries would imply a price bias consistent with the Boskin commission findings.",1997-11-07
"Of course, the United States is not the only country that faces challenges in constructing an accurate measure of inflation.",1997-11-07
"In a recent survey of consumer price indexes in its member countries, the OECD found that most countries felt that measurement bias was smaller in magnitude in their own countries than in the United States.",1997-11-07
"Many countries' responses were prepared by the countries' statistical agencies, which tend to take a somewhat more sanguine view of the adequacy of the existing price statistics than do outside economists.",1997-11-07
"Indeed, as I noted previously, most European countries still have yet to adopt the most up-to-date techniques for measuring computer prices in their national accounts.",1997-11-07
"Indeed, issues of price measurement may be especially important for the European countries entering into monetary union.",1997-11-07
"For a region with a single monetary policy, a single, consistently estimated measure of inflation is necessary to gauge the region's economic performance.",1997-11-07
"Toward that end, as you know, Eurostat publishes harmonized indexes of consumer prices that are constructed using a common basket of goods and services for each EU member state and using similar statistical methodology.",1997-11-07
"Subsequent to monetary union, harmonized consumer prices can be used as the best available measure of inflation in the Euro area.",1997-11-07
"In the United States, for example, the CPI calculated on this harmonized basis would have increased three or four tenths of a percentage point more slowly than the published CPI, on average, over the past few years, largely because prices of owner-occupied housing have been rising more rapidly than the other components.",1997-11-07
"Arguably, the published index, with broader coverage, is more relevant to assessing inflation trends in the United States than would be the harmonized index.",1997-11-07
"As long as relative prices can and do diverge across countries, the harmonized indexes need to contain as broad a range of items as is practical.",1997-11-07
"As monetary union proceeds, then, it would be to the advantage of monetary authorities in the Euro area to have a consistent measure of inflation defined over a broad basket of goods and services that is measured according to established statistical methods.",1997-11-07
"Indeed, measuring prices consistently across countries could be an important step toward making price measurement more accurate everywhere, if harmonization results in each country's best practices being adopted throughout the monetary union.",1997-11-07
"Moreover, different prices of the same tradable good across the community might signal inefficiencies of distribution which were not evident from other sources.",1997-11-07
Harmonization of CPIs in Europe is just one of many examples demonstrating why price measurement techniques cannot be static.,1997-11-07
"The information revolution, which lies behind so much of the rapid technological change that makes prices difficult to measure, may also play an important role in helping our statistical agencies acquire the necessary speed and agility to better capture the changes taking place in our economies.",1997-11-07
But the possibilities offered by information technology for the improvement of price measurement may turn out to be much broader in scope.,1997-11-07
Today my goal is to explain my outlook for the U.S. economy as well as how that perspective shapes my views on the appropriate approach to monetary policy.1 I have three points I would like you to take away from my comments.,2021-10-19
"First, while there has been a significant slowdown in third quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth, it should rebound in the first half of 2022.",2021-10-19
"Second, I believe that substantial progress has been made on both the inflation and employment legs of our dual mandate.",2021-10-19
"Finally, the next several months are critical for assessing whether the high inflation numbers we have seen are transitory.",2021-10-19
"If monthly prints of inflation continue to run high through the remainder of this year, a more aggressive policy response than just tapering may well be warranted in 2022.",2021-10-19
"In terms of economic growth, data for the third quarter of 2021 show that the economic recovery slowed as the effects of the Delta variant caused consumers and businesses to start pulling back on some forms of economic activity such as travel and leisure.",2021-10-19
"I and most other forecasters expected that real GDP would grow close to the very strong rate posted in the first half of the year, but it now appears that GDP growth will be closer to 3 percent at an annual rate.",2021-10-19
"Meanwhile, we have seen labor shortages in many regions and many sectors that seem unwarranted given the level of unemployment and other indicators of slack in the labor market.",2021-10-19
All of this recent experience encourages me to believe that the moderation in the expansion of economic activity in recent months that is directly related to the Delta surge will be a temporary phenomenon.,2021-10-19
"I expect that this slowdown has only delayed the economic recovery into the first half of 2022, and thus I moved what I thought would be strong growth in the second half of this year into the first half of next year.",2021-10-19
"This delay means that my medium-term outlook for economic growth really has not changed much at all, and that I forecast the strong recovery will continue.",2021-10-19
"Despite these unexpectedly low numbers, there is still some good news from the September reportâ€”namely, that the disappointing number was due to unexpected declines in employment by state and local governments that may be attributed to limited labor supply that will work itself out in coming months.",2021-10-19
"Nevertheless, the numbers are concerning, given that as many as 8 million workers may have rolled off unemployment insurance programs in September.",2021-10-19
"The September jobs report also showed the unemployment rate falling four-tenths of 1 percent, from 5.2 percent to 4.8 percent.",2021-10-19
"It is striking that, in 16 months, the unemployment rate has fallen from 14.8 percent in April 2020 to just 4.8 percent now.",2021-10-19
"However, one data series, such as the unemployment rate, is insufficient at capturing the overall status of the labor market.",2021-10-19
Now let me focus on the Federal Reserve's goals for monetary policy.,2021-10-19
"As the minutes of the September Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting conveyed, many participants judge that we have achieved substantial progress on our inflation goal.3 With regard to substantial further progress on our employment objective, I believe we have now met that criterion despite the disappointing jobs reports for August and September.",2021-10-19
"Furthermore, the September unemployment rate of 4.8 percent is not that far from the 3.5 percent unemployment rate that was realized in February 2020.",2021-10-19
"While there is still room to improve on the employment leg of our mandate, I believe we have made enough progress such that tapering of our asset purchases should commence following our next FOMC meeting, which is in two weeks.",2021-10-19
Inflation Inflation has been running higher this year than I and most forecasters expected.,2021-10-19
"The unexpected inflation we have observed has raised costs for households and businesses and complicated their planning, which has a real effect on people's lives.",2021-10-19
"For the Fed, the question is whether higher inflation this year undermines moving toward our economic goals.",2021-10-19
"On that score, I continue to believe that the escalation of inflation will be transitory and that inflation will move back toward our 2 percent target next year.",2021-10-19
"That said, I am still greatly concerned about the upside risk that elevated inflation will not prove temporary.",2021-10-19
We have seen substantial increases in many prices.,2021-10-19
Lumber prices skyrocketed through May but have largely retraced that increase in the past few months.,2021-10-19
Prices for used cars rose substantially from mid-2020 to mid-2021 but now seem to have stabilized at this higher level.,2021-10-19
"At present, I am closely watching prices for housing services (rent and owners' equivalent rent), which saw modest increases last year but have picked up recently.",2021-10-19
"In addition, energy prices have moved up noticeably in recent months, and market conditions suggest risk of further increases.",2021-10-19
"As I said earlier, I still see supply and demand working here to moderate price increases so that inflation moves back toward 2 percent.",2021-10-19
But I also see some upside pressures on inflation that bear watching.,2021-10-19
"Through our business contacts, we continue to hear stories about bottlenecks at almost every stage of production and distributionâ€”for example, plants that shut down because of a shortage of one or more crucial inputs; a poor cotton crop in the United States due to weather, which is driving up prices; and clogged ports and trucker shortages.",2021-10-19
"That apparently has not made its way into prices yet, but how long before it becomes a factor driving inflation?",2021-10-19
"Firms are reporting that they have more pricing power now than they have had in many years, as consumers seem to be accepting higher prices.",2021-10-19
The simple answer is that I believe the next few months will be crucial to understanding whether elevated rates of inflation last and if that will trigger a lasting effect on the U.S. economy.,2021-10-19
"We will know more as time goes on about whether inflation in the prices of those goods and services will level off or even fall, as lumber prices have, and how other prices will evolve.",2021-10-19
"But, importantly, we will also know whether this period of higher inflation has started to affect expectations of future inflation.",2021-10-19
"A critical aspect of our new framework is to allow inflation to run above our 2 percent target (so that it averages 2 percent), but we should do this only if inflation expectations are consistent with our 2 percent target.",2021-10-19
"If inflation expectations become unanchored, the credibility of our inflation target is at risk, and we likely would need to take action to re-anchor expectations at our 2 percent target.",2021-10-19
"This raises a couple of key questions: Whose inflation expectations do we examine, and how do we determine if they are unanchored?",2021-10-19
"With regard to the first question, we measure inflation expectations two ways.",2021-10-19
"First, we survey the public and ask them what they expect the inflation rate to be in coming years.",2021-10-19
"Second, we can infer inflation expectations from differences in yields between Treasury securities that are indexed for inflation and those that are not.",2021-10-19
"These breakeven inflation measures from the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities market are referred to as ""market based"" measures of inflation compensation.",2021-10-19
Survey measures give us an idea of what the average household expects inflation to be in the coming years.,2021-10-19
"Presumably, this measure of expectations is important because it should influence households' wage demands as they seek compensation for an increasing cost of living.",2021-10-19
"This is why I have always preferred market-based measures of inflation expectations, because they are formed by investors who are betting with real money about future inflation.",2021-10-19
This brings us to another question: Are inflation expectations anchored around our inflation target of 2 percent?,2021-10-19
Survey measures have shown a dramatic increase in inflation expectations over the past few months.,2021-10-19
"The recent New York Fed measure has short- and medium-term inflation expectations at 5.3 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively.",2021-10-19
This is eye opening and a genuine cause for concern should households embed these expectations in wage demands.,2021-10-19
"However, market-based measures of inflation expectations and the five-year inflation expectations from the New York Fed survey continue to be anchored near our 2 percent target.",2021-10-19
"I also look at the Board of Governors staff's common inflation expectations measure, which distills a signal from both surveys and market-based inflation gauges.",2021-10-19
This gives me some comfort that the recent run of high inflation readings has not led to an unanchoring of inflation expectations.,2021-10-19
"It is important to account for all measures of inflation expectations and not ""cherry pick"" the measure that one finds most comforting.",2021-10-19
I would like to follow up on this last point as it pertains to thinking about inflation.,2021-10-19
"As I mentioned earlier, a lot of commentators, including me, have deflected concerns about high inflation readings being the result of ""outliers"" or ""idiosyncratic"" price movements.",2021-10-19
"As a result, recent high inflation readings are transitory and not broad based.",2021-10-19
But there is a fallacy in doing so that one should avoid in judging whether higher inflation is indeed transitory.,2021-10-19
"There are sound reasons for this, such as when we exclude volatile food and energy prices to get a measure of ""core"" inflation; that kind of measure often is more stable and can tell us whether the underlying forces behind inflation are moving as rapidly as it might seem from headline inflation.",2021-10-19
"A similar logic applies to trimmed mean measures of inflation, such as the Cleveland Fed trimmed mean consumer price index and the Dallas Fed trimmed mean PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation rate.",2021-10-19
These measures censor the tails of the price change distribution to avoid having average inflation distorted by extreme price movements.,2021-10-19
"However, inflation is distilled from many prices, and those prices do not move uniformly.",2021-10-19
"As a result, we may be led to ""falsely"" dismiss certain price movements and risk being misled as to the true inflation rate.",2021-10-19
"Consider a three-good economy with goods A, B and C, and look at how their prices increase over time.",2021-10-19
"In one world, the price of each good goes up 2 percent every year.",2021-10-19
"Thus, average inflation is 2 percent every year, and there is no reason to question that measure, as it is broad based.",2021-10-19
This is typically what we have in mind when we think about trend inflation.,2021-10-19
"In this world, inflation is meeting the FOMC's 2 percent target and there is no need for a policy change.",2021-10-19
Now consider a world in which there are sharp price changes that are staggered across the goods.,2021-10-19
"In year 1, the price of good A goes up 5 percent, while the price of goods B and C increase 2 percent.",2021-10-19
"If we assume equal weights for each good, the inflation rate for this economy is 3 percent.",2021-10-19
"This repeats in year 2, with the price of good B increasing 5 percent while the other two have increases of 2 percent.",2021-10-19
"In this economy, inflation averages 3 percent each year, which is above the FOMC's 2 percent inflation target.",2021-10-19
"First, if one used a trimmed-mean measure of inflation, you would throw out the highest and the lowest readings for each year.",2021-10-19
The average inflation rate would be 2 percent every year.,2021-10-19
"Thus, over a three-year period, a trimmed mean measure of inflation would be 2 percent and indicate we are hitting our inflation target when the true measure would be 3 percent per year.",2021-10-19
"A second way of manipulating the data is to say in year 1, ""Look, inflation is being driven by good A, which had an idiosyncratic, outsized price increase.",2021-10-19
"If you throw it out, the underlying inflation rate is 2 percent.""",2021-10-19
"Then in year 2, you say, ""Good B had an idiosyncratic price increase, so throw it out.""",2021-10-19
"Again, by selectively throwing out unusually high price increases for individual goods, you would conclude that inflation over the three-year period is 2 percent and we are hitting the inflation target when, in fact, it was 3 percent.",2021-10-19
"Third, one can justify throwing out good A in the first year by saying it did not reflect a broad-based price increaseâ€”the prices of 67 percent of the goods rose 2 percent.",2021-10-19
"So, based on these goods, we are hitting our inflation target.",2021-10-19
"Finally, one could claim, correctly, that the large price increase for good A is ""transitory""â€”it went up strikingly in year 1 but then dropped back, meaning inflation should fall back to our inflation target in coming periods.",2021-10-19
"But that will mislead you in terms of understanding the true inflation rate, because you are putting zero probability that a large spike in inflation will happen to another good in the future.",2021-10-19
"The moral of this little example is that one needs to be careful when selectively ignoring data seriesâ€”be it used car prices, food and energy prices, or household surveys of inflation expectations.",2021-10-19
"All of these series convey important information about the evolution of inflation, and one should exhibit caution in dismissing data as outliers.",2021-10-19
"We must keep our eyes open to inflationary pressures, wherever they come from, with consistency and rigor and stand ready to adjust policy if we conclude that such a change is warranted.",2021-10-19
"This brings me to how I believe monetary policy should evolve in the coming months, based on the outlook I have described.",2021-10-19
"Our test for this step was making ""substantial further progress"" toward our employment and inflation goals.",2021-10-19
"After years of running below 2 percent, the recent and sustained increase in inflation clearly represents substantial progress toward our goal.",2021-10-19
"And the continued gains in employment, despite a couple of months of a slowdown, along with results across a range of labor market indicators, indicate to me that there has also been substantial further progress toward maximum employment.",2021-10-19
"Importantly, this action should not tighten financial conditions, since a later 2021 tapering has already been priced in by most participants.",2021-10-19
"I believe the pace of continued improvement in the labor market will be gradual, and I expect inflation will moderate, which means liftoff is still some time off.",2021-10-19
"That said, as I mentioned earlier, if my upside risk for inflation comes to pass, with inflation considerably above 2 percent well into 2022, then I will favor liftoff sooner than I now anticipate.",2021-10-19
"A major consideration will be my judgment about whether inflation expectations are at risk of becoming ""unanchored""â€”rising substantially and persistently above 2 percent.",2021-10-19

"July 14, 2020 Navigating Monetary Policy through the Fog of COVID Governor Lael Brainard At the Perspectives on the Pandemic Webinar Series, hosted by the National Association for Business Economics, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share Watch Live The COVID-19 contraction is unprecedented in modern times for its severity and speed.",2020-07-14
"Following the deepest plunge since the Great Depression, employment and activity rebounded faster and more sharply than anticipated.",2020-07-14
"Looking ahead, it likely will be appropriate to shift the focus of monetary policy from stabilization to accommodation by supporting a full recovery in employment and a sustained return of inflation to its 2 percent objective.1 A variety of data suggest the economy bottomed out in April and rebounded in May and June.",2020-07-14
Payroll employment rebounded strongly in May and June.,2020-07-14
"Over May and June, payroll employment increased by 7.5 million, the unemployment rate fell 3.6 percentage points, and the labor force participation rate rose 1.3 percentage points.4 The large bounceback is a sharp contrast to the Global Financial Crisis, when the initial employment decline was shallower and it took much longer before a similar share of the initial job losses was recouped.",2020-07-14
"They likely were driven by an earlier-than-expected rollback of COVID-related restrictions as businesses ramped up hiring and consumers exhibited more comfort engaging in commercial activities, as well as by a boost to employment from the Paycheck Protection Program.",2020-07-14
These developments mostly occurred after the reference period for the June employment report.,2020-07-14
"After declining at a fast clip through early June, initial claims for unemployment insurance have moved roughly sideways in recent weeks and remained at a still elevated level of 1.3 million in the week ending July 4.5 Some high-frequency indicators tracked by Federal Reserve Board staff (including mobility data and employment in small businesses) suggest that the strong pace of improvement in May and the first half of June may not be sustained.",2020-07-14
"According to the Current Population Survey, the number of employed persons fell by 14.2 percent from February to June among African Americans and by 13.4 percent among Hispanicsâ€”significantly worse than the 10.4 percent decline for the population overall.6 Separately, on the other side of our dual mandate, inflation has receded further below its 2 percent objectiveâ€”reflecting weaker demand along with lower oil prices in recent months.",2020-07-14
"Both core and total PCE price inflation measures have weakened, with the 12-month percent changes through May standing at 1.0 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively.7 Measures of inflation expectations are mixed; while market-based measures have moved below their typical ranges of recent years, survey measures have remained relatively stable within their recent historical ranges.8 Nonetheless, with inflation coming in below its 2 percent objective for many years, the risk that inflation expectations could drift lower complicates the task of monetary policy.",2020-07-14
Several daily and weekly retail spending indicators tracked by Federal Reserve Board staff suggest that household spending increased quickly in response to stimulus payments and expanded unemployment insurance benefits.,2020-07-14
"Household spending stepped up in mid-April, coinciding with the first disbursement of stimulus payments to households and a ramp-up in the payout of unemployment benefits, and showed the most pronounced increases in the states that received more benefits.9 With some of the fiscal support measures either provided as one-off payments or slated to come to an end in July, the strength of the recovery will depend importantly on the timing, magnitude, and distribution of additional fiscal support.",2020-07-14
"In addition to the headwinds facing demand, there could be persistent effects on the supply side of the economy.",2020-07-14
"In downside scenarios, there could be some persistent damage to the productive capacity of the economy from the loss of valuable employment relationships, depressed investment, and the destruction of intangible business capital.",2020-07-14
"Last month, a majority of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants indicated they expect economic activity to decline notably this year and recover only gradually over the following two years.",2020-07-14
A majority of FOMC participants indicated that they expect core inflation to remain below our 2 percent objective and employment to fall short of its maximum level at least through the end of 2022.,2020-07-14
"Looking ahead, it will be important for monetary policy to pivot from stabilization to accommodation by supporting a full recovery in employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective on a sustained basis.",2020-07-14
"As we move to the next phase of monetary policy, we will be guided not only by the exigencies of the COVID crisis, but also by our evolving understanding of the key longer-run features of the economy, so as to avoid the premature withdrawal of necessary support.",2020-07-14
"The likelihood that the policy rate is at the lower bound more frequently risks eroding expected and actual inflation, which could further compress the room to cut nominal interest rates in a downward spiral.",2020-07-14
"With underlying inflation running below 2 percent for many years and COVID contributing to a further decline, it is important that monetary policy support inflation expectations that are consistent with inflation centered on 2 percent over time.",2020-07-14
"And with inflation exhibiting low sensitivity to labor market tightness, policy should not preemptively withdraw support based on a historically steeper Phillips curve that is not currently in evidence.",2020-07-14
"Instead, policy should seek to achieve employment outcomes with the kind of breadth and depth that were only achieved late in the previous recovery.11 With the policy rate constrained by the effective lower bound, forward guidance constitutes a vital way to provide the necessary accommodation.",2020-07-14
"For instance, research suggests that refraining from liftoff until inflation reaches 2 percent could lead to some modest temporary overshooting, which would help offset the previous underperformance.12 Balance sheet policies can help extend accommodation by more directly influencing the interest rates that are relevant for household and business borrowing and investment.",2020-07-14
Then I want to talk in more detail about how monetary policy is determined.,2005-02-07
"The role of the Board vis-à-vis the regional Banks was elevated in the aftermath of the stock market crash of 1929 and in the early years of the Great Depression, but the combination of centralized and regional responsibilities remains an important strength of the Federal Reserve System, as I'll explain shortly when I discuss the formulation of monetary policy.",2005-02-07
The emphasis was on providing currency and reserves to meet seasonal demands and on assisting banks in accommodating the credit needs of commerce and business.,2005-02-07
"Today, the Federal Reserve's duties fall into four general areas--some that would have been familiar to the central bankers in the Fed's early years and some that would have been unfamiliar: maintaining the stability of the financial system and containing systemic risk that may arise in financial markets supervising and regulating banking organizations to ensure the safety and soundness of the nation's banking and financial system and to protect consumers from harm in their use of credit and banking services playing a major role in operating and overseeing the nation's payment system, including providing certain financial services to financial institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign official institutions conducting monetary policy in pursuit of stable prices and maximum sustainable employment We have an all-too-recent example of the Fed as a source of financial stability in its response to the financial aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, which occurred just before I joined the Board in December 2001.",2005-02-07
"Monetary Policy But it is monetary policy--and the Fed's principal monetary lever, the federal funds rate, which is the interest rate on overnight loans of reserves between depository institutions--that earns the Federal Reserve all that ink and airtime.",2005-02-07
"Each of the seven members of the Board wields a vote, as does the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York by virtue of that Bank's unique responsibility for implementing monetary policy decisions through the open market operations of its Domestic Trading Desk.",2005-02-07
"As currently formulated, the announcement has four parts: the first states the target for the federal funds rate; the second briefly explains the Committee's analysis of current economic conditions; the third provides the Committee's assessment of the risks to price stability and economic growth; and the last provides Committee members' votes.",2005-02-07
"Before the advent of FOMC statements, market observers had to infer shifts in monetary policy by watching the New York Fed's open market operations, and trying to guess whether the Fed was easing or tightening monetary policy.",2005-02-07
This move is the latest in a long sequence of changes that the Federal Reserve has implemented over the past decade to enhance the openness and transparency of monetary policymaking.,2005-02-07
"For that reason, speeding up the release of the minutes was seen as helping markets interpret our policy actions in the context of evolving economic developments and so better anticipate the course of interest rates.",2005-02-07
My impression is that most investors agree that the change is an improvement in openness and transparency of monetary policy.,2005-02-07
"The Chairman also delivers twice-a-year reports to the Congress on monetary policy, where he speaks for the FOMC.",2005-02-07
"As I mentioned, our goals--price stability and maximum sustainable employment--are set by law, but we are afforded the political independence to make the sometimes unpopular decisions required to achieve those goals.",2005-02-07
This topic is under active review by the Federal Reserve and our peers in many other economies.2 Looking Back The report explores the important question of whether the new monetary policy tools are likely to be sufficiently powerful in the next downturn.,2020-02-21
"The report assesses how unconventional toolsâ€”including forward guidance, balance sheet policies, negative nominal interest rates, yield curve control, and exchange rate policiesâ€”have performed over the past few decades.",2020-02-21
"This approach adds to what we have learned from earlier papers that have examined the performance of unconventional policy tools with respect to individual components of financial conditionsâ€”most notably, long-term sovereign yields, but also mortgage rates, equities, exchange rates, and corporate debt spreads.3 Empirically assessing the question in the report is not only important, but also challenging, as the report readily acknowledges.",2020-02-21
"The delays often reflected concerns about the putative costs and risks of these policies, such as stoking high inflation and impairing market functioning.",2020-02-21
"Looking Ahead The current generation of central bankers faces a different core challenge than the last generation, with substantially smaller scope for cutting interest rates to buffer the economy and inflation that is low and relatively unresponsive to resource utilization.",2020-02-21
"With trend inflation running below the symmetric 2 percent objective, there is a risk that inflation expectations have slipped.",2020-02-21
"With price inflation showing little sensitivity to resource utilization, policy may have to remain accommodative for a long time to achieve 2 percent inflation following a period of undershooting.",2020-02-21
"With the equilibrium interest rate very low, the Federal Open Market Committee can cut the federal funds rate by only about half as much as it has done historically to buffer the economy from recession.",2020-02-21
"Consequently, the policy rate is likely to be constrained by the lower bound more frequently, likely at times when inflation is below target and unemployment is elevated.",2020-02-21
"The likelihood that the policy rate will be stuck at the lower bound more frequently risks eroding expected inflation and actual inflation, which could further compress the room to cut nominal interest rates in a downward spiral.",2020-02-21
"Equally important, we should adopt a strategy that successfully achieves maximum employment and average inflation outcomes of 2 percent over time.",2020-02-21
The lessons from the crisis would argue for an approach that commits to maintain policy at the lower bound until full employment and target inflation are achieved.,2020-02-21
This forward guidance could be reinforced by interest rate caps on short-term Treasury securities over the same horizon.,2020-02-21
"Forward guidance that commits to refrain from lifting the policy rate from its lower bound until full employment and 2 percent inflation are achieved is vital to ensure achievement of our dual-mandate goals with compressed conventional policy space.7 To strengthen the credibility of the forward guidance, interest rate caps could be implemented in tandem as a commitment mechanism.",2020-02-21
"Based on its assessment of how long it is likely to take to achieve full employment and target inflation, the Committee would commit to capping rates out the yield curve for a period consistent with its expectation for the duration of the outcome-based forward guidance.",2020-02-21
One important benefit is that this approach would smoothly move to capping interest rates on the short-to-medium segment of the yield curve once the policy rate moves to the lower bound and avoid the risk of delays or uncertainty that could be associated with asset purchases regarding the scale and timeframe.,2020-02-21
The interest rate caps would transmit additional accommodation through the longer rates that are relevant for households and businesses in a manner that is more akin to conventional policy and more continuous than quantitative asset purchases.,2020-02-21
Setting the horizon on the interest rate caps to reinforce forward guidance on the policy rate would augment the credibility of the yield curve caps and thereby diminish concerns about an open-ended balance sheet commitment.,2020-02-21
"Once target inflation and full employment are achieved, and the caps expire, any short-to-medium-term Treasury securities that were acquired under the program would roll off organically, unwinding the policy smoothly and predictably.",2020-02-21
"This approach should avoid some of the tantrum dynamics that have led to premature steepening of the yield curve in several jurisdictions.8 Today's low-inflation, low interest rate environment requires not only new recession-fighting tools but also a new strategy to address the persistent undershooting of the inflation targetâ€”and the risk to inflation expectationsâ€”well before a downturn.",2020-02-21
"Various strategies have been proposed that seek to make up for past inflation deviations from target.9 To be successful, formal makeup strategies, such as an average-inflation-targeting rule, require that market participants, households, and businesses understand the policy in advance and find it credible.",2020-02-21
"While formal average-inflation-targeting rules have some attractive properties in theory, they could be difficult to communicate and implement in practice due to time-inconsistency problems as well as uncertainty about underlying economic parameters.10 I prefer flexible inflation averaging that would aim to achieve inflation outcomes that average 2 percent over time.",2020-02-21
Flexible inflation averaging would imply supporting inflation a bit above 2 percent for some time to compensate for the inflation shortfall over previous years and anchor inflation expectations at 2 percent.,2020-02-21
"Flexible inflation averaging would bring some of the benefits of a formal average-inflation-targeting rule, but it could be more robust and simpler to communicate and implement.",2020-02-21
"Following several years when inflation has remained in the range of 1-1/2 to 2 percent, the Committee could target inflation outcomes in a range of 2 to 2-1/2 percent for a period to achieve inflation outcomes of 2 percent, on average, overall.",2020-02-21
"By committing to achieve inflation outcomes that average 2 percent over time, the Committee would make clear in advance that it would accommodate rather than offset modest upward pressures to inflation in what could be described as a process of opportunistic reflation.11 This approach will help move inflation expectations back to our 2 percent objective, which is critical to preserve conventional policy space.",2020-02-21
"It is important to emphasize that for monetary policy to be effective, it will be key for policymakers to communicate their strategy clearly in advance to the public, to act early and decisively, and to commit to providing the requisite accommodation until full employment and target inflation are sustainably achieved.",2020-02-21
This was one of the important conclusions of this year's U.S. Monetary Policy Forum report.,2020-02-21
"Fiscal Policy Even with a revamped monetary policy strategy and expanded tools, there are risks.",2020-02-21
"As the authors note, persistent very low levels of long-run rates could hamper the ability of monetary policy to support the economy in a downturn through the traditional mechanism of pushing down long-term rates.12 Moreover, the equilibrium interest rate or, possibly, inflation expectations could be lower than most current estimates, with the implication that unconventional policies would need to compensate for a larger reduction in the conventional policy buffer.13 Accordingly, in addition to a forceful response from monetary policy, robust countercyclical fiscal policy is vital.",2020-02-21
"The reduced conventional monetary policy buffer makes the importance of fiscal support during a downturn even greater than it has been in the past, and the case for fiscal support is especially compelling in the context of very low long-term interest rates.",2020-02-21
"Not only is fiscal policy more vital when monetary policy is constrained by the lower bound, but research suggests it is also more powerful.14 Whereas monetary policy is powerful but blunt, fiscal policy can be more targeted in its effects.",2020-02-21
"This is especially important today, when a large share of American households have low liquid savings and are particularly vulnerable to periods of unemployment or underemployment.",2020-02-21
"Just as monetary policymakers are actively reviewing their tools and strategies, now is the time to undertake a review of fiscal tools and strategies to ensure they are ready and effective.",2020-02-21
The new normal of low interest rates and inflation also has implications for the interplay between financial stability and monetary policy.,2020-02-21
"In the decades when the Phillips curve was steeper, inflation tended to rise as the economy heated up, which would prompt the Committee to raise interest rates to restrictive levels.",2020-02-21
"These interest rate increases would have the effect of tightening financial conditions more broadly, thereby naturally damping financial imbalances as the expansion extends.",2020-02-21
"With trend inflation persistently below target and a flat Phillips curve, not only is the policy rate expected be low for long due to the decline in the neutral rate, but the policy rate may also remain below the neutral rate for longer in order to move inflation back to target sustainably.",2020-02-21
"The expectation of a long period of accommodative monetary policy and low rates, during a period with sustained high rates of resource utilization, is conducive to risk-taking, providing incentives to reach for yield and take on additional debt.",2020-02-21
"To the extent that the combination of a low neutral rate, a flat Phillips curve, and low underlying inflation may lead financial imbalances to become more tightly linked to the business cycle, it is important to use tools other than monetary policy to temper the financial cycle.",2020-02-21
"In today's new normal, a combination of strengthened structural safeguards along with countercyclical macroprudential tools is important to enable monetary policy to stay focused on achieving maximum employment and target inflation.15 The countercyclical capital buffer, which was not available before the crisis, is particularly well designed to address financial imbalances over the cycle.",2020-02-21
"To be fully effective, proactive use of an expanded toolkit needs to be coupled with a new strategy that achieves average inflation outcomes of 2 percent along with maximum employment over time.",2020-02-21
"According to the latest World Economic Outlook from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), consumer price inflation in the advanced economies over the decade beginning in 1997 and ending next year looks set to come in at an average annual rate of less than 2 percent, down from 3-1/2 percent for the previous ten years.",2005-11-03
"The IMF figures for the United States show a smaller but still substantial decline in headline inflation, from about 3-3/4 percent to 2-1/2 percent.",2005-11-03
"The drop in inflation for the non-industrial economies has been more striking, with average inflation falling from double to single digits over the same time periods.1 As someone who started work as a monetary policymaker in 1997, I am happy to acknowledge the accomplishments of many policymakers at the Federal Reserve and in other central banks around the world.",2005-11-03
"Thanks to their success in fighting inflation, the central banking profession enjoys a very high standing.",2005-11-03
"And as a related matter, we might say that monetary credibility, which I would define as the perception in the private sector that central banks will do what it takes to keep inflation under control, is also quite high.",2005-11-03
"The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) at its most recent meeting increased the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 4 percent, and observed: The cumulative rise in energy and other costs has the potential to add to inflation pressures; however, core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained.",2005-11-03
".With underlying inflation expected to be contained, the Committee believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.",2005-11-03
"Nonetheless, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.",2005-11-03
"Unfortunately, however, the story over the past twenty years is not so uniformly positive for growth.",2005-11-03
"Again according to IMF figures, growth among the non-industrial economies appears to have increased to about 5-1/4 percent in the decade beginning in 1997, compared with growth of 3-3/4 percent in the previous ten years.",2005-11-03
"Growth in the United States has also moved slightly higher over the two periods, from 3 percent to 3-1/4 percent.",2005-11-03
"However, growth in the other industrial economies has softened, to less than 2-1/2 percent in the recent decade from more than 3 percent in the previous one.",2005-11-03
"This decline reflects slowing in some of the larger economies--Japan, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands--as well as the effect of the Asian crisis in 1997 on newly industrialized Asian economies.2 To me, it is axiomatic that monetary credibility, by reducing the level and variability of inflation, lays the foundations for stronger and more-sustained economic growth.",2005-11-03
"In my remarks today, I want to discuss anecdotal and academic evidence for the relationship between monetary policy credibility and economic growth and to do so in two segments: first, the link between monetary policy credibility and inflation performance and, second, the link between inflation performance and longer-run economic growth.",2005-11-03
"Monetary Policy Credibility and Inflation Performance Outcomes Does monetary credibility help secure lower inflation, less-variable inflation, and inflation that is less sensitive to shocks?",2005-11-03
"Low and stable inflation must start with sound policy--that is, policy that keeps output near potential and offsets shocks to supply and demand appropriately.",2005-11-03
"When the central bank is viewed to be both committed to and effective at keeping inflation contained, inflation expectations will tend to be anchored.",2005-11-03
"And so long as the central bank pursues sensible policies, those expectations will tend to be self-fulfilling, as they should lead to movements in prices and wages that are consistent with inflation staying low and stable.",2005-11-03
"Conversely, if credibility is lacking and inflation expectations are high, firms will be raising prices, and workers will be demanding large wage increases, making it more costly, in terms of jobs and output, for the central bank to tighten policy sufficiently to achieve low inflation.",2005-11-03
"In the past two years, crude oil prices have about doubled.",2005-11-03
"During the 1970s, similar run-ups set off sharp increases in global inflation.",2005-11-03
"Today, by contrast, core inflation rates both in the United States and abroad, while they have moved up some, remain essentially contained.",2005-11-03
"In large part, they remain so because central banks, including the Federal Reserve, have substantially bolstered their commitment to price stability since the 1970s and markets are now much more confident that monetary authorities will keep inflation from rebounding.",2005-11-03
"Accordingly, rising oil prices have not triggered a sharp rebound in long-term inflation expectations, and we have not seen the anticipatory hikes in prices and wages that were so destabilizing a few decades back.",2005-11-03
"In essence, monetary credibility helps the central bank do its job, by inducing private sector participants also to take actions that help achieve the central bank's low inflation objective.",2005-11-03
"Of course, given the persistence of high energy prices that the global economy has confronted of late, policymakers cannot be complacent.",2005-11-03
Central bankers must reinforce their credibility and validate the confidence of market participants by actively leaning against inflationary pressures long before inflation itself builds.,2005-11-03
"Again, the FOMC has done just that through its commitment to adjust policy as required to keep inflation at bay.",2005-11-03
"Aside from such anecdotal evidence, much formal research supports the view that a strong commitment to price stability helps reduce and stabilize inflation.",2005-11-03
"For example, Gagnon and Ihrig, staff economists at the Federal Reserve, have studied the effects of monetary policy on the response of inflation to currency depreciation.3 They show that, over the past few decades, the sensitivity of inflation to currency depreciation has generally declined in industrial economies.",2005-11-03
"For 18 of the 20 industrial countries studied, the authors find that the rate of pass-through of currency depreciation to inflation fell as the rate of inflation declined between 1971 and 2000, with pass-through in the second half of the sample period averaging about a third of what it was in the first half.",2005-11-03
"In addition, they find that these declines tended to be larger in countries where central banks increased the weight they placed on fighting inflation.",2005-11-03
"The Gagnon and Ihrig result represents evidence that a strong commitment to price stability can lead to more-stable prices, but it leaves open the extent to which central bank credibility--as opposed to policy action--contributes to this outcome.",2005-11-03
"Other research, conducted by Laxton and N'Diaye at the IMF, shows that a model of inflation and unemployment performs better when inflation expectations are entered into the model as a function of long-term bond yields than when such expectations are assumed to depend on past inflation alone.4 Thus, their research affirms the influence of inflation expectations on actual inflation.",2005-11-03
"Finally, there is considerable literature on the effects of central bank independence on inflation.5 In one standard view, politically motivated desires to stimulate the economy, run budget deficits, or redistribute wealth in favor of one social group or another are important sources of inflationary pressure.",2005-11-03
"These pressures have long been part of the political landscape, and indeed, it was for these reasons that the framers of the Federal Reserve sought to insulate the Fed from political pressures.6 That central bank independence frees the monetary authority to pursue price stability more diligently, resulting in lower and less-variable inflation, is supported by many studies.7 Inflation tends to be lower in countries where there are legal and other institutional safeguards to central bank independence.",2005-11-03
"In spite of this ample academic evidence of the role of good policy and central bank independence in achieving price stability, we must face the fact that the particular contribution of monetary credibility, as contrasted with the contribution of central bank policies themselves, is difficult to measure.",2005-11-03
"Not only does effective central bank policy lead to good inflation outcomes, but it is the primary contributor to monetary credibility.",2005-11-03
"The research I have briefly described makes clear that a commitment to fighting inflation, low inflation expectations, and central bank independence all contribute to restraining inflation.",2005-11-03
"Moreover, theory and intuition tell us that monetary credibility will be greatest when the central bank does what it is supposed to do: offset economic shocks to keep price pressures from building and thereby keep inflation itself low and stable.",2005-11-03

"Empirical research attempting to establish solid links between low inflation and sustainable economic growth has met with mixed success, in part because of the many complicated factors determining both inflation and growth.",2005-11-03
"Following seminal work by Stanley Fischer, researchers seem to agree that extreme inflation rates, say above 40 percent per year, are associated with reduced economic growth.8 Such high rates of inflation are often a sign of an economy in or approaching crisis, and once inflation crosses the threshold of 40 percent, inflation is considerably more unstable and likely to rise.",2005-11-03
"Under such conditions, firms have great difficulty in setting prices and consumers in appraising them.",2005-11-03
"In general, growth slows during such crises, as evidenced by the collapse of the Argentine economy during its hyperinflation at the end of the 1980s or the ravages of the European hyperinflations of the 1920s.",2005-11-03
"In these situations, the association between growth and inflation is clear, although causality can be difficult to disentangle.",2005-11-03
But what can we say about lower inflation rates?,2005-11-03
Is the pace of economic development slower when inflation is at 15 percent than when it is at 5 percent?,2005-11-03
Research by IMF staff economists Khan and Senhadji has turned up a negative association between inflation and growth.,2005-11-03
"Using nonlinear estimation techniques, these economists report finding thresholds above which inflation significantly slows growth.9 The thresholds identified in this work are 1 percent to 3 percent for industrial economies and 11 percent to 12 percent for developing economies.",2005-11-03
"Levine and Renelt (1992), for example, found no robust relationship in exhaustive cross-section studies, and many researchers using other techniques have also failed to detect a significant relationship.10 The problem may lie in identifying the direction of causation: In the short-to-medium run, causality may run from higher growth to higher inflation, as business-cycle pressures push spending and activity above the economy's capacity.",2005-11-03
"This direction of causality may obscure the negative relationship, running from higher inflation to lower growth, presumed to hold in the longer term.",2005-11-03
"Of course, as a central banker, it makes sense to me that lower and more-stable inflation, by making the returns to saving and investment more predictable and by diminishing the likelihood of shocks to the financial system, should encourage economic growth.",2005-11-03
"For example, the United States has experienced a higher average, and less volatile, growth rate since the mid-1980s.",2005-11-03
"This ""Great Moderation"" has been attributed by most observers, at least in part, to improved monetary policy and, by extension, to lower and more-stable inflation.11 Low and stable inflation offers other benefits as well, which may affect the growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) over time.",2005-11-03
These include reducing the arbitrary redistributions of wealth and income associated with higher and more-variable inflation and shrinking the distortions to resource allocation in the tax code.,2005-11-03
"12 Accordingly, and I am obviously not alone in this view, it is clear that central banks should strive to achieve low, stable inflation.",2005-11-03
"Of course, low inflation is at best a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for growth.",2005-11-03
"In many poor economies, inflation may be less of an obstacle to development than poor governance, inadequate education, and legal systems that fail to protect property rights or to enforce commercial contracts.",2005-11-03
"Yet, no tradeoff forces countries to choose between lowering inflation and reforming their institutions.",2005-11-03
"On the contrary, high inflation is often a sign of institutional breakdown, and reducing inflation may help to rebuild confidence in economic and political prospects.",2005-11-03
"Conclusion In conclusion, let us not forget that the declines in inflation over the past two decades and the resulting boost to monetary credibility we currently enjoy were earned with some economic pain, as the pace of economic activity was slowed, at times severely, to bring inflation down.",2005-11-03
"With longer-run inflation expectations better anchored now throughout the world, I believe that global economic growth will be stronger and more resilient as a result.",2005-11-03
The question you and I might be asking right now is: What is a monetary policymaker doing here?,2000-02-23
"My assignment is to answer this question: How do the prevailing surplus and, especially, decisions about the allocation of future potential surpluses affect the formulation and conduct of monetary policy?",2000-02-23
"Using this concept will allow us to focus on the implications of alternative combinations of monetary and fiscal policies--yielding the same level of aggregate demand--for the real interest rate, the composition of output, and the current account balance.",2000-02-23
"However, other important features of recent macroeconomic experience--specifically the absence of a large decline in real interest rates and the significant deterioration in the current account balance--appear at least superficially inconsistent with the predictions from the standard analytics.",2000-02-23
Perhaps even more important are other developments that have affected real interest rates and the current account balance over the same period.,2000-02-23
"I conclude by discussing the implications for monetary policy of options for the allocation of the ""potential"" surplus.",2000-02-23
I focus on two ways in which fiscal policy choices could affect monetary policy.,2000-02-23
"First, fiscal policy choices will affect the interest rate consistent with full employment and price stability.",2000-02-23
"Second, a gradual reduction and ultimate retirement of the federal government debt would require changes in the way monetary policy is implemented.",2000-02-23
There are infinite combinations of monetary and fiscal policies that yield the same level of aggregate demand.,2000-02-23
"The different combinations result in different outcomes for the level of real interest rates, the composition of output, and the current account balance.",2000-02-23
The IS curve shows the combinations of interest rate (R) and output (Y) consistent with equilibrium in the output market.,2000-02-23
The LM curve shows the combinations of interest rate and output consistent with equilibrium in the market for money.,2000-02-23
The intersection of the curve shows the unique combination of the interest rate and output consistent with equilibrium in all markets simultaneously.,2000-02-23
Let's start from a simple case in which the level of capacity is given at a moment in time and the intersection of IS and LM curves determines the prevailing level of aggregate demand.,2000-02-23
"I will assume that the intersection takes place at potential output, so that the outcome is consistent with the broad objectives of monetary policy: price stability and full employment.",2000-02-23
Evaluating alternative fiscal policies at an unchanged level of output--and specifically at potential output--also allows us to abstract from cyclical changes in the deficit and thereby to focus exclusively on changes in the structural budget balance.,2000-02-23
The position of the LM curve is determined in part by the stance of monetary policy.,2000-02-23
"In this case, we could view the level of the money stock as being adjusted by open market operations to be consistent with the Federal Reserve's target for the interest rate.",2000-02-23
"Alternatively, we could draw the LM curve as a horizontal line at the prevailing interest rate target set by the FOMC.",2000-02-23
"In Figure 1 (6 KB), I depict two of the infinite number of combinations of IS and LM curves that intersect at potential output--the intersection at B corresponding to a looser fiscal and tighter monetary policy than the intersection at A.",2000-02-23
"A combination of tighter fiscal and looser monetary policy (point A compared with point B in figure 1 (6 KB)) implies a lower interest rate, a higher share of investment (and, in general, of interest-sensitive components of spending) in GDP, a lower value of the dollar, and a higher level of net exports and hence of the current account surplus.",2000-02-23
"In addition, more sophisticated models would also show explicitly the increase in the exchange rate and the associated decline in the current account balance in response to a policy mix that resulted in higher real interest rates.",2000-02-23
"Not only do changes in tax rates and spending affect aggregate demand, they can also affect aggregate supply, for example, when they alter after-tax wage rates and after-tax rates of return to saving and investment.",2000-02-23
The Politics of the Policy Mix: Does Monetary Policy Respond to Fiscal Policy?,2000-02-23
"Over the last 20 years, these decisions generally have been based on considerations that have more to do with long-run objectives such as promotion of higher longer-term growth, than with short-run stabilization.",2000-02-23
"The Federal Reserve then sets its policy to achieve the broad objectives assigned to it, specifically, price stability and full employment.",2000-02-23
"Fiscal decisions are, in turn, affected by budget forecasts that are partly contingent on monetary policy assumptions.",2000-02-23
"Monetary policymakers smooth the transition to the new equilibrium, by minimizing the effect on output relative to full employment and on prices.",2000-02-23
"Because monetary policy adjusts continuously to changes in the economy, including those resulting from fiscal policy, it makes sense to think that fiscal policy decisions are made first and monetary policy decisions are conditional on the fiscal decisions.",2000-02-23
So does this mean that monetary policy responds directly to fiscal policy actions?,2000-02-23
"That is, monetary policy responds to changes in fiscal policy in much the same way that it responds to other influences on the economy, such as equity prices, exchange rates, or the demand for U.S. exports due to changed growth prospects abroad.",2000-02-23
Each and all of these developments affect both the macroeconomic developments and the forecast that drive adjustments in monetary policy in pursuit of full employment and price stability.,2000-02-23
It is also important not to overstate the role monetary policy plays in shaping the policy mix.,2000-02-23
"In terms of our diagram, the game is fundamentally over when the fiscal decision pins down the intersection of the IS curve and the vertical line at full employment.",2000-02-23
"One possibility, of course, is that the Federal Reserve adjusts its open market operations to move the interest rate to this point.",2000-02-23
"In a regime in which the Fed implements policy by choosing a target for the money stock, either the money stock could be adjusted to move the LM curve to this point, or price flexibility would ultimately get the job done, with the emphasis on the ultimately.",2000-02-23
"The role of active monetary policy is to avoid the need for price flexibility--that is, to prevent the fiscal decision from either temporarily lowering output below its full employment level or permanently increasing prices.",2000-02-23
"Under a plausible policy rule--for example, utilizing actual or forecast output gaps and inflation rates--the interest rate would be reset over time until it was consistent with the intersection of the IS curve and the vertical line at potential output and price stability.",2000-02-23
The message of such an interest rate rule is that monetary policy responds only indirectly to fiscal policy.,2000-02-23
"That is, the rule specifies the adjustment of the interest rate to changes in output and prices (the indirect approach), not the adjustment to changes in tax rates or spending (as would be the case in a direct approach).",2000-02-23
"However, if we look at the reduced form equation for the now endogenous monetary policy instrument, we shall, to be sure, find--lurking on the right-hand side--the exogenous components of the fiscal policy decision--the level of discretionary spending and the benefit and tax rates.",2000-02-23
"In the ""real world,"" of course, many factors besides fiscal policy are likely to be affecting inflation and output.",2000-02-23
Comparing the Theoretical Prediction to Recent Experience The swing from budget deficit to surplus has been much more dramatic than was expected when the fiscal year 1994 budget was adopted.,2000-02-23
"Such a dramatic swing in the budget balance might have been expected to yield a particularly dramatic confirmation of the predictions of the analytic model, in the form of a sharp decline in real interest rates and a significant improvement in the current account balance.",2000-02-23
"In fact, during the period of a dramatic swing in the budget balance, real interest rates have not declined, and the current account balance has significantly deteriorated.",2000-02-23
"In addition, in the analytics, by holding output fixed at potential, we abstracted from the effect of cyclical influences on the budget balance, on interest rates, and on the current account.",2000-02-23
"The key to getting the right answer in the analysis is to identify correctly the multiple shocks that induced the swing in the ratio of deficit to GDP and that affected the real interest rate and current account, as well as to take into account the effect of the cyclical developments.",2000-02-23
I assumed in the analytics of the policy mix that that any non-cyclical change in the deficit was due to a change in policy--some combination of increases in tax rates and cutbacks in government spending.,2000-02-23
"But to apply this to our dynamic economy, we have to allow for uncertainty about the level of potential output at a given time and the growth in potential output over time.",2000-02-23
"However, the more serious problem with the application of the conventional framework is the failure to account for structural change, specifically a decline in the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) and an increase in trend growth.",2000-02-23
More rapid trend income growth would also increase the growth of imports and hence cause a deterioration in the current account.,2000-02-23
"In addition, higher trend productivity growth, driven by an increase in the profitability of investing in new technology, would raise the equilibrium real interest rate and encourage capital flows to the United States to take advantage of higher returns on capital.",2000-02-23
"This in turn would lead to an appreciation of the dollar, further augmenting the current account deficit.",2000-02-23
"Once again, it appears that the increase in the economy's trend rate of productivity growth is playing a starring role in our explanation of recent macroeconomic developments.",2000-02-23
"In discussing the interaction between the swing in the federal budget and the increase in the productivity trend, I have focused on how the latter may have offset the tendency of the former to lower real interest rates.",2000-02-23
"The increase in the equilibrium real interest rate, expected as a result of an increase in the productivity trend, is also a ceteris paribus result.",2000-02-23
"For example, if tax rates are constant and government spending remains a constant share of GDP, then the higher productivity trend will, in general, yield a higher equilibrium real interest rate.",2000-02-23
"However, if real (or nominal) government spending is held constant, the surplus will rise over time as a share of GDP, putting downward pressure on the equilibrium real rate, offsetting, at least in part, the effect on the real rate of the higher trend productivity.",2000-02-23
But the recent episode underscores the difficulty of actually predicting real interest rates and the current account when unknowable shocks will surely intervene along the way.,2000-02-23
"Rather, my assignment is to connect fiscal and monetary policy decisions.",2000-02-23
I have emphasized the value of evaluating fiscal policy options in models that incorporate reasonable monetary policy reaction functions.,2000-02-23
"Doing so builds in the indirect response of monetary policy to fiscal policy changes, consistent with the logic of the policy mix.",2000-02-23
"This is, in effect, the approach I followed my discussion of the analytics of the policy mix by assuming that monetary policy is reset--albeit indirectly--in response to a change in fiscal policy.",2000-02-23
"The other options involve increased fiscal stimulus and, as a result, will be accompanied, ceteris paribus, by a higher equilibrium real interest rate in the long run.",2000-02-23
They would also likely result in a lower share of investment in output and a higher current account deficit than the option that preserves higher surpluses.,2000-02-23
"Ceteris paribus, monetary policy--run off a sensible reaction function--will end up validating the higher equilibrium real interest rate, to keep prices from accelerating indefinitely.",2000-02-23
The Implications of Debt Retirement for Monetary Policy Operations One additional consequence of the choice among these options is that preserving the surpluses would lead to a gradual decline in and ultimately the retirement of the federal government debt.,2000-02-23
"The prospects for such an outcome depend, of course, on the realized growth rate of income and hence tax revenue and one's assumption about the starting base of expenditures and the appropriate baseline for its rate of growth.",2000-02-23
"Once the baby boomers begin to retire, the social security trust fund will be progressively run down, and at some point, the overall budget will likely move from surplus to deficit again.",2000-02-23
"Although the Treasury market has been the traditional vehicle for monetary policy operations in recent decades, the Federal Reserve Act provides authority for the Federal Reserve to purchase a fairly wide range of other assets--including obligations of federal agencies, certain obligations of state and local governments, foreign exchange, and sovereign debt.",2000-02-23
"There would, of course, be transitional issues as monetary policy operations adapted.",2000-02-23
But we surely maintain the effectiveness of our monetary policy operations.,2000-02-23
So a decision about whether or not to hold on to the surpluses and ultimately retire the government debt should not be affected by any concern that this option might undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy.,2000-02-23
Some have been concerned that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury might be working at cross purposes today to the extent that reductions in the Treasury debt supply have lead to declines in longer-term Treasury rates at a time when monetary policy is aiming to slow the pace of economic activity to a more sustainable rate.,2000-02-23
"To date, the main impact of Treasury operations and debt management prospects has been on longer-term Treasury rates, with only a small spillover effect on the financial variables that affect private spending decisions--short- and longer-term private interest rates, equity prices, and exchange rates.",2000-02-23
"To the extent that Treasury debt management operations affect the private interest rates or other financial conditions that matter for private spending decisions, the FOMC can always adjust its policy settings as appropriate to achieve its objectives.",2000-02-23
"They understand that they make crucial contributions to the policymaking process, not only in the realm of monetary policy but in banking, payments, consumer affairs, and other areas, and they bring great pride and professionalism to their work.",2004-03-27
"The theme of the panel is ""Monetary Policy Modeling: Where Are We and Where Should We Be Going?""",2004-03-27
"So I think the best I can do is highlight three general areas in which much good work has already been done, including research by Messrs. Henderson, Porter, and Tinsley, but in which further progress would be enormously helpful to monetary policymaking in practice.",2004-03-27
The first area is the characterization of good monetary policy in increasingly realistic and complex model environments.,2004-03-27
"We have learned a great deal in recent years about the effects of monetary policy in dynamic, stochastic, sticky-price models, with Michael Woodford's recent book (Woodford, 2003) perhaps best representing the state of the art.",2004-03-27
"For example, in some of these models, strict inflation targeting--a policy of keeping inflation at zero at all times--is the optimal policy.",2004-03-27
"The Erceg-Henderson-Levin (EHL) paper explores the implications for monetary policy of a plausible complication, the inclusion in the model of nominal wage stickiness as well as price stickiness.",2004-03-27
"Specifically, in the EHL model, monetary policy can no longer achieve a fully optimal outcome but instead faces tradeoffs among its objectives.",2004-03-27
"For example, Canzoneri, Cumby, and Diba consider further complications of the sticky-price, sticky-wage model, including capital investment and habit formation in consumption, while Benigno and Woodford explore the case in which the steady state of the model is not Pareto optimal, as assumed by EHL.",2004-03-27
"A second important area, one that will always be central to monetary policy, is macro forecasting.",2004-03-27
"Because monetary policy works with a lag, the ability of policymakers to stabilize the economy depends critically on our ability to peer into our cloudy crystal balls and see something resembling the future.",2004-03-27
One of the key variables to be forecast is inflation.,2004-03-27
"A variety of approaches to forecasting inflation are used at the Board, of course.",2004-03-27
One of Dick Porter's many contributions was to develop a monetary approach to forecasting inflation at medium-term horizons.,2004-03-27
"That equation is of course the quantity equation, MV = PY, or money times velocity equals the price level times output.",2004-03-27
This equation can be used to define a link between money growth and inflation that depends on the evolution of the velocity of money.,2004-03-27
"This approach seems to work reasonably well at predicting inflation at medium-term horizons, and the forecasts of this model are reported routinely to the Board of Governors.",2004-03-27
"Because good forecasts are so crucial to good monetary policy, I hope and expect to see a great deal more work exploring the robustness of alternative forecasting methods.",2004-03-27
"For example, a rich recent literature on learning and macroeconomics has emphasized that actual inflation and inflation expectations may to some degree evolve independently, and that effective monetary policy stabilizes inflation expectations as well as inflation itself (Orphanides and Williams, 2003).",2004-03-27
"For example, Kozicki and Tinsley (2001) show that it is far easier to make sense of the term structure of Treasury yields if one assumes that expectations about long-run inflation adjust in a reasonable adaptive manner.",2004-03-27
"In a paper presented at a recent conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Kozicki and Tinsley (2003) develop an empirical model of the economy under the assumptions that the Fed's implicit inflation target is subject to permanent shocks and that the public learns about the Fed's target over time.",2004-03-27
"Although simple, their model allows for a much richer and realistic description of the evolution of monetary policy and the economy.",2004-03-27
"For example, their approach gives empirical content to the idea of imperfect monetary policy credibility; in their model, monetary policy is credible when private expectations of long-run inflation tend to align closely with the central bank's true underlying inflation target.",2004-03-27
"I call the remarkable combination of healthy growth, low unemployment, low inflation, a soaring stock market, and declining federal budget deficit the ""good news"" economy.",1997-09-17
And the third challenge is to assess the risks in the current environment and determine how monetary policy should be positioned to keep the good news coming.,1997-09-17
"Second, in assessing the current environment and its implications for monetary policy, uncertainties require us to balance historical regularities and newer possibilities.",1997-09-17
"Cyclical regularities clearly in evidence include accelerator effects, changing tolerances for risk, and cyclical swings in the unemployment rate and in profits.",1997-09-17
Two other regularities that I especially want to focus on today are the Phillips Curve and the trend growth in output.,1997-09-17
"The latter regularities define limits -- limits to the sustainable level of output, at any moment, and, once that level of capacity is reached, to the growth of output over time.",1997-09-17
"If these limits are exceeded, as typically happens during a cyclical expansion, the economy eventually overheats, inflation increases, and the expansion is undermined as policy is forced to rein in demand.",1997-09-17
"Transitory influences, clearly among the stars of the current episode, feature a coincidence of favorable supply shocks that have restrained inflation.",1997-09-17
"Finally, structural adjustments, in this episode, hint at a decline in NAIRU and/or an increase in trend growth.",1997-09-17
"Before moving to the substance of my talk, let me remind you that my remarks on the outlook and monetary policy, today and always, are my views.",1997-09-17
"We have been recently blessed with relatively strong cyclical growth, the lowest unemployment rate in 24 years, the lowest inflation in 31 years, an impressive investment boom, soaring equity prices and a 5-year decline in the federal budget deficit that may take the deficit to below 1/2% of GDP in fiscal 1997.",1997-09-17
And the key in the near term may be crosscurrents that appear likely to both moderate output growth and keep inflation relatively well contained.,1997-09-17
"In the case of output growth, the crosscurrents are the continued strength in demand and the expected slowing in inventory investment.",1997-09-17
"As a result, demand is expected to remain strong in the second half of the year, paced by a rebound in consumer spending and complemented by continued strength in business fixed investment.",1997-09-17
"Forecasters know, however, that the composition or mix of output in one quarter -- specifically the mix between final demand and inventory investment -- often provides an important hint of what is to come.",1997-09-17
"The resulting slowdown in inventory investment is likely, therefore, to be a significant drag on production in the second half of this year, offsetting, at least in part, the expected rebound in final demand.",1997-09-17
"On the inflation side, there are also important crosscurrents at work.",1997-09-17
"I have been concerned about two considerations that suggest that inflation may well rise over time: the possibility that the economy is operating today beyond its sustainable capacity and the likelihood that the transitory factors that have, on balance, been restraining inflation will diminish in importance over time.",1997-09-17
"However, three other influences that, in my view, have gradually become more significant considerations, are likely to moderate the tendency for inflation to rise in the near term.",1997-09-17
"First, lower-than-expected overall and core inflation and continued modest pace of wage change over this year will encourage more restrained increases in wages and prices over the coming year.",1997-09-17
"Lower inflation leads to lower inflation expectations, reinforcing the prospect for low inflation ahead.",1997-09-17
"In this case, inertia is our friend and the result is a virtuous wage-price spiral, at least for a while.",1997-09-17
"Second, some of the transitory factors, especially the appreciation of the dollar and resulting decline in import prices, appear to have longer legs and are likely to contribute more toward restraint on inflation in coming quarters than earlier appeared likely.",1997-09-17
"Third, the upward adjustment to profits in the July NIPA revisions suggests there is more of a profit cushion that could delay the pass-through of higher compensation to price increases.",1997-09-17
"While these crosscurrents suggest moderation in both output growth and inflation, crosscurrents don't necessarily balance.",1997-09-17
"With respect to output growth, the crosscurrents do point toward slower growth in the second half compared to the first half, but is important whether the slower growth turns out to be near trend, holding utilization rates constant, or above trend, pushing utilization rates still higher.",1997-09-17
"But there is a risk that growth will continue to be above trend, pushing utilization rates up, from already high levels.",1997-09-17
"With respect to inflation, the netting of the crosscurrents suggests a modest increase in inflation in 1998, albeit from a steadily downward-revised and very low rate in 1997.",1997-09-17
"I will pay very close attention to the source of any rebound in inflation, specifically the degree to which it reflects simply the dissipation of some of the favorable supply shocks that have contributed to the very low inflation this year and the degree to which it reflects the more persistent effect of high utilization rates.",1997-09-17
"As a result, I will be focusing more on core than overall inflation rates and paying particularly close attention to labor costs, given that labor markets appear tighter than product markets and therefore more likely to be the source of any increase in inflation pressures.",1997-09-17
"Still, any increase in inflation would begin from a lower base and may be more modest than previously appeared likely.",1997-09-17
"The bottom line is that past performance, in several important dimensions, has been extraordinary and that prospects look favorable for continued expansion and relatively low inflation.",1997-09-17
"Still, monetary policy must be alert to the potential of a developing upward trend in inflation in an economy that may already be operating beyond its sustainable capacity and possibly still growing at an above-trend rate.",1997-09-17
Limits on What Monetary Policy Can Do The first challenge is to avoid becoming complacent.,1997-09-17
"Specifically, there are dimensions of economic performance which are less stellar, such as the slow average growth rate in GDP in the 1990s, a continuation of the effects of the productivity slowdown that began in the early 1970s.",1997-09-17
"And there remain lingering social strains associated with a gradual increase in income inequality, interacting with the low average growth rate in productivity to produce a long period of relatively stagnant real income for the median income family.",1997-09-17
This less rosy perspective on the current state of the economy was suggested by several members of Congress during the recent oversight hearings on monetary policy.,1997-09-17
"I think the point is an important one and I agree that we should not let the recent favorable performance of inflation, unemployment and equity prices distract our attention from the importance of confronting a slow average rate of increase in living standards and lingering social problems that both reflect and are exacerbated by a widening in income inequality.",1997-09-17
"However, other than through its pursuit of its legislative mandates of price stability and maximum sustainable employment, monetary policy cannot make a major contribution to the resolution of these problems.",1997-09-17
"Monetary policy, in particular cannot remedy increases in income inequality, raise the trend rate of increase in living standards, or combat inadequate opportunities for upward mobility out of poverty.",1997-09-17
"It is, as always, important that we carry out our traditional responsibilities well, accommodating the maximum sustainable growth and achieving the maximum sustainable level of employment.",1997-09-17
"Regularities The second challenge is to explain why performance has been so favorable, at least in terms of inflation and unemployment.",1997-09-17
"In doing so, I will focus on cyclical expansions that have not been dominated by dramatic external shocks, such as the two episodes that were marked by steeply rising world oil prices -- first in the early 1970s and again in the late 1970s and early 1980s.",1997-09-17
The economy typically makes a rapid transition from declining output (the definition of recession) to above-trend growth.,1997-09-17
"In a loose way, trend growth refers to the growth in the economy's productive capacity.",1997-09-17
"When growth is above trend, production is expanding faster than the economy's productive capacity and, as a result, resource utilization rates rise.",1997-09-17
Rising capacity utilization rates and falling unemployment rates are thus a typical feature of an expansion period.,1997-09-17
"The natural dynamic of an expansion is for above-trend growth to continue until demand overtakes capacity, despite the best efforts of policy to avoid cyclical excesses.",1997-09-17
"Expansions do not die of old age or lethargy, a spontaneous weakening of aggregate demand, but rather of an accumulation of imbalances, specifically with demand outstripping the limits of sustainable level of input utilization and growth of output.",1997-09-17
The resulting rise in inflation becomes a threat to the continued expansion.,1997-09-17
"In this story, NAIRU sets a limit to how far the economy can expand before overheating sets in and inflation rises, and the Phillips Curve traces out an important part of the dynamics of inflation, how fast it responds to excess demand.",1997-09-17
"Of course, the Phillips Curve framework has always been much easier to describe than to implement, given uncertainties about the estimates of NAIRU, given the fact that empirical regularities between inflation and unemployment always left much of the variation in inflation unexplained, and given the importance of supply shocks with significant, though transitory, effects on the inflation-unemployment nexus.",1997-09-17
"Nevertheless, the regularity in the cyclical sensitivity of inflation, as embedded in the Phillips Curve, has proved to be an important guide to both forecasters and monetary policymakers in the past.",1997-09-17
"It is possible that the Phillips Curve and NAIRU is simply the wrong analytical framework, but I doubt it and am not aware of another model of inflation dynamics that is ready to take its place.",1997-09-17
"I would just note that these favorable supply shocks include an appreciation of the dollar and consequent decline in import prices; a slowing in the rate of increase in benefit costs, concentrated in a slowdown in costs for health care insurance; a faster rate of decline in computer prices than earlier, reflecting the quicker pace of innovation; and more recently, a decline in oil prices and a slower rate of increase in food prices.",1997-09-17
One regularity of past expansions has been the close relationship between two widely used measures of resource utilization -- the capacity utilization and unemployment rates.,1997-09-17
"In this case, it did not matter which one was used as a proxy for excess demand; and the unemployment rate could be used interchangeably as a measure of labor market demand pressures and overall economy-wide demand pressures.",1997-09-17
The unemployment rate is flashing a warning of a very tight labor market.,1997-09-17
Why has this divergence developed and what are its implications for the relationship between inflation and unemployment?,1997-09-17
"The resulting absence of excess demand in the product market is, in my view, an important factor explaining the frequently reported absence of pricing leverage by firms.",1997-09-17
Nothing gives a firm pricing leverage like excess demand.,1997-09-17
"In addition, the resulting inability of firms to pass on higher costs in higher prices likely has altered the way firms operate in the labor market, making them more reluctant to bid aggressively for workers, contributing to a slower rate of increase in wages than we would otherwise have expected at prevailing labor utilization rates.",1997-09-17
"It is possible that the gap that has opened between the unemployment and capacity utilization rates may be a factor that has, in effect, lowered NAIRU in this expansion.",1997-09-17
"Possibilities The most intriguing explanations for the recent favorable performance are structural changes, which may have relaxed the capacity constraints that are the core of the cyclical regularities story, or made these constraints more flexible than in the past, or tempered the ability and/or willingness of firms to respond to excess demand by raising wages and prices.",1997-09-17
"There are two possibilities that have been widely discussed: that the economy can now sustain a lower unemployment rate without rising inflation (i.e., that NAIRU has declined) and that, once capacity has been reached, the economy is now capable of faster growth, compared to the estimates of trend growth reported earlier.",1997-09-17
"A lot of the discussion about this episode focuses on sorting out the relative importance of the two possibilities -- specifically, whether the recent favorable performance is due more to labor market structural change, as reflected in a lower NAIRU, or to product market structural change, as reflected in a higher rate of growth in productivity.",1997-09-17
"The result is a slower rate of increase in compensation at any given level of unemployment, equivalent to a decline in NAIRU.",1997-09-17
Another possible explanation is the divergence between the unemployment and capacity utilization rates in this expansion that I discussed earlier.,1997-09-17
"Some workers, to be sure, gain, by opportunities for employment that otherwise would have been denied.",1997-09-17
Has there been an increase in trend productivity?,1997-09-17
Another possibility is that the trend rate of increase in productivity -- and hence the economy's sustainable rate of growth in GDP -- has recently increased.,1997-09-17
There is some confusion in many discussions of productivity growth about the implications of measurement bias.,1997-09-17
"It is widely accepted that there is a downward bias in measured productivity growth, the mirror image of the upward bias in measured inflation.",1997-09-17
The measurement issue is relevant to explaining the inflation-unemployment experience in the current episode only if the bias has recently become more serious.,1997-09-17
"Note also that if the measurement bias has increased, this would imply that both actual and potential output growth are higher than reported, with no obvious implication for the gap between actual and potential output, and hence for inflation pressures.",1997-09-17
"Sources of higher productivity growth, all of which should show up in measured productivity, include a return on years of corporate restructuring and the increase in capital per worker associated with the current investment boom, much of which is linked to technological change, specifically the information revolution.",1997-09-17
No other explanation has the ability to explain as many features of the current experience as an increase in trend productivity.,1997-09-17
"There are, however, some problems with this story as the principal explanation for the favorable inflation performance.",1997-09-17
"First, a productivity explanation would resonate better if the puzzle were why higher wage change was not being passed on in higher prices.",1997-09-17
But the greater puzzle is the slow pace of increase in compensation per hour at prevailing unemployment rates.,1997-09-17
"This is more clearly the case after the downward revision in compensation in the July NIPA revisions, bringing that measure of compensation per hour more in line with the Employment Cost Index.",1997-09-17
"Given the rate of increase in compensation, an unchanged trend growth in productivity of 1.1%, for example, seems quite consistent with recent price performance.",1997-09-17
"Although not without some serious shortcomings, the published productivity data provide little encouragement to the view that there has been a significant improvement in underlying productivity growth.",1997-09-17
"The growth in measured productivity over this expansion has, in fact, been disappointing.",1997-09-17
"Over 1994 and 1995, in particular, measured productivity was nearly flat.",1997-09-17
"Although it has accelerated over the last two years, this is consistent with another cyclical regularity, the tendency for productivity to accelerate with economic activity.",1997-09-17
"And the rate of growth over the last year, even with the sharp upward revision in the second quarter, is 1.2%, just above the 1.1% average rate of increase over the period from the early 1970s up to the beginning of this expansion.",1997-09-17
"For example, the acceleration in productivity to a 1.2% rate over the last year, at a time when the unemployment rate was dropping to a level that would suggest less productive workers were being drawn on, leaves open the possibility that the productivity trend has quickened.",1997-09-17
Perhaps the strongest case for an increase in the productivity trend comes from the higher rate of growth over the past two years if productivity is measured from the income side of the national accounts.,1997-09-17
"Balancing regularities and possibilities In my testimony at the Congressional oversight hearings, I presented a range of estimates for NAIRU and trend growth from the CBO, Council of Economic Advisers, DRI, Macroeconomic Advisers and Professor Robert Gordon.",1997-09-17
"The range for NAIRU was 5.4% to 5.9% and for trend growth, 2.1% - 2.3%.",1997-09-17
"I presented these estimates in my testimony to emphasize the continuing importance the profession attaches to NAIRU, the central tendency of current NAIRU estimates, and the absence of significant upward adjustments to estimates of trend growth.",1997-09-17
The Challenge for Monetary Policy Some day we shall look back on this episode with historical perspective and perhaps -- and only perhaps -- have a better ability to sort out what contributed to the favorable outcome and the extent to which the prevailing coexistence of low unemployment and stable low inflation proved permanent or transitory.,1997-09-17
"Monetary policy, however, is made in real time.",1997-09-17
The appropriate stance of monetary policy should reflect both the increased uncertainty surrounding the failure of historical regularities to predict the better-than-expected outcome in terms of inflation and unemployment and the best judgment about regularities as we update our estimates of NAIRU and trend growth in response to current data.,1997-09-17
"At one extreme, the uncertainty about the source of the recent performance might be viewed as so great that the best course for monetary policy is a reactive posture, waiting for clear signs that inflation is rising and only tightening in response to such evidence.",1997-09-17
A prudent approach would continue to lean against the cyclical winds by adjusting policy in response to persistent increases in utilization rates as well as in response to changes in underlying inflation.,1997-09-17
And it is important to keep in perspective any questions about how tight labor markets might be or whether near-term growth might remain above trend.,1997-09-17
"Before the 1980s, research papers, economic commentary, and textbooks here and abroad were full of discussions of the causes and consequences of high inflation and of the political difficulty of bringing it under control.",2003-10-01
It looked then like inflation had become a more or less permanent feature of the economic landscape.,2003-10-01
"Concepts associated with deflation such as liquidity traps and the zero bound on nominal interest rates had, for practical purposes, disappeared from economic thought.",2003-10-01
"But, beginning around 1980, central banks around the world seem to have ganged up on inflation, fought the fight, and won.",2003-10-01
"The International Monetary Fund's consumer price index for industrial countries registered an annual rate of inflation exceeding 12 percent in 1980, but by 2002 the rate had dropped to just 1.4 percent.",2003-10-01
"In the United States, consumer price inflation excluding food and energy fell from 12.4 percent in 1980 to 2.4 percent in 2002.",2003-10-01
Japan has actually had negative rates of inflation for the past four years.,2003-10-01
"The drop in inflation in many prominent emerging-market countries has been even more breathtaking (Rogoff, 2003).",2003-10-01
Perhaps just as remarkable as the abrupt fall in worldwide inflation is the widespread agreement on the reasons for its fall.,2003-10-01
"Macroeconomists had long understood that, in the famous words of Milton Friedman, ""inflation is everywhere and always a monetary phenomenon.""",2003-10-01
"Perhaps because of advances in understanding the inflation process, perhaps because of worrisome increases in inflation rates, perhaps because of a discovery that the economic costs of fighting inflation were not as high as previously believed, central bankers in the 1980s suddenly began to use their monetary control to limit the rate of increase in prices.",2003-10-01
"Now that something like price stability has arrived, two important policy questions present themselves: Is a mere determination to achieve price stability adequate for central banks to stabilize prices, or should their determination be backed up by more formal institutional structures, such as in inflation-targeting regimes?",2003-10-01
Exactly how stable do we want prices to be--rising at a measured rate of zero or at some other rate?,2003-10-01
Maintaining Price Stability Price stability is widely understood to be a feasible objective and to be sustainable with little long-run cost in terms of output and unemployment.,2003-10-01
"Indeed, many believe that greater price stability should also stabilize output, and that the improved allocation of resources coming from price stability should promote productivity and raise living standards in the long run.",2003-10-01
"As a part of this consensus, central banks around the developed world are now firmly determined to achieve and maintain price stability.",2003-10-01
"Much of the world--countries in the British Commonwealth (the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand), in Scandinavia (Finland, Norway, and Sweden), in eastern Europe (the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland) and many emerging-market countries (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, South Africa, and Thailand)--have buttressed this determination to maintain price stability by adopting formal inflation-targeting regimes.",2003-10-01
"The regimes vary, but the key element is an explicit commitment to meet a publicly stated numerical target rate of inflation within a particular time frame.",2003-10-01
The targets and commitments are accompanied by reports giving inflation forecasts and plans for meeting inflation goals.,2003-10-01
"All regimes provide some leeway in meeting their goals--inflation rates do not have to be brought down to the target levels immediately, and special factors can be taken into account.",2003-10-01
But the regimes must have a credible plan for meeting inflation targets at least over the medium run.,2003-10-01
"Recently the European Central Bank (ECB) has adopted a system that has some elements of an inflation-targeting regime, though it lacks many of the accountability features.",2003-10-01
"A few industrial countries--the United States, Japan, and Switzerland--have resisted pressures to adopt formal inflation-targeting regimes.",2003-10-01
Debates continue in these countries about the desirability of adopting more formal inflation-targeting procedures.,2003-10-01
"The inflation targeters point to the advantages of transparency, commitment, and accountability; non-targeters point to the loss of flexibility and the reduction in the ability to meet alternative goals such as high employment and financial stability.",2003-10-01
I can see the advantages of transparency and commitment and of giving financial markets some indication about the central bank's inflation goals.,2003-10-01
"I can also see the fear that, in practice, such regimes may in fact constrain actions in ways that could be rigid, inflexible, and perhaps unnecessary in bringing down inflation.",2003-10-01
There are two ways to evaluate the effect of formal inflation-targeting regimes.,2003-10-01
"In the early days of inflation targeting, a number of researchers took the first approach and compared the inflation performance of targeting countries before and after the inflation-targeting regime was introduced.",2003-10-01
"In these studies, which measured actual inflation rates and inflation premiums on long-term bonds (to measure expected inflation), one could find evidence that inflation targeting seemed to have worked to bring down inflation and its persistence (see, for example, Kuttner and Posen, 1999; and Freeman and Willis, 1995).",2003-10-01
But these early studies took place at the time of a worldwide drop in inflation rates.,2003-10-01
"Just as inflation-targeting countries could show elements of improved inflation performance, nontargeting countries could as well.",2003-10-01
"The second approach to studying the effect of targeting, cross-section analysis, compares inflation performance for targeting and nontargeting countries.",2003-10-01
"The advent of the ECB created a huge impediment to such studies because it came into being midway through the relevant data period, and it initiated a centralized regime that had aspects of inflation targeting for many of the large countries that had previously not had such a regime.",2003-10-01
"It is difficult to know whether the ECB countries should be considered inflation targeters in the last half of the time-series sample, and it is especially difficult to interpret the experience of these countries.",2003-10-01
"Over the 1994-2002 period, seven prominent inflation-targeting industrial countries had a mean inflation rate of consumer prices of 2.1 percent per year with a standard deviation of 1.7 percent.",2003-10-01
"One could consider Japan a special case and eliminate it from the latter group, but the two-country results would still show slightly lower and more stable inflation in the nontargeting countries.",2003-10-01
"Ball and Sheridan (2003) have done that, also making an adjustment for initial rates of inflation.",2003-10-01
Their conclusion is similar to an earlier cross-section finding of Cecchetti and Ehrmann (1999) that inflation aversion increased in both targeting and nontargeting countries.,2003-10-01
"To summarize these international data, one might say that something brought inflation down in the 1980s and 1990s, but success was fairly uniform across both the inflation-targeting and nontargeting countries.",2003-10-01
"When one does ""before and after"" tests for individual inflation-targeting countries spanning this period, inflation targeting often looks successful in bringing about low rates of inflation and in reducing inflation variability and persistence.",2003-10-01
"But by the late 1990s, inflation had fallen in all industrial countries, and it is hard to find much difference in inflation performance between inflation-targeting and nontargeting countries--if anything, inflation has been lower and more stable in the latter group.",2003-10-01
"One is therefore tempted to conclude that the general understanding of the inflation process and a firm determination to achieve price stability, more than the inflation-targeting regime itself, has been the key element in reducing inflation.",2003-10-01
How Stable Should Prices Be?,2003-10-01
"Collectively, the central banks of the world have done well in reducing inflation, generally moving from an inflationary regime to one of reasonably stable prices.",2003-10-01
"All the way to exactly stable prices with a measured inflation rate that averages zero, or somewhat short of that goal?",2003-10-01
I will argue strongly that central banks should stop short of zero--that a low positive rate of inflation is optimal.,2003-10-01
One involves the so-called zero bound on nominal interest rates; the other involves labor markets.,2003-10-01
"Regarding the zero bound, as inflation drops toward zero, nominal interest rates drop toward real rates, which themselves might be low if the reason inflation is dropping involves negative demand shocks.",2003-10-01
"At these low rates, the central bank is poorly positioned to respond to further negative demand shocks.",2003-10-01
"Because of the zero bound, it is impossible for nominal interest rates to decline further, but it is still possible for inflation to decline to below zero--that is, for deflation to set in.",2003-10-01
The combination implies that real interest rates may actually start to rise in the face of negative demand shocks.,2003-10-01
"In this range, the central bank loses much of its ability to respond to these negative demand shocks by lowering real rates of interest.",2003-10-01
"As many have pointed out, the central bank could still respond to negative demand shocks by expanding money growth in various ""nontraditional"" ways.",2003-10-01
"Today the standard thinking is that the central bank can and should avoid dealing with these difficulties by guiding the economy toward a low, positive rate of inflation, not a zero rate.",2003-10-01
"If nominal wages cannot be cut for workers who, for whatever reason, become less productive, labor market flexibility is enhanced by having low positive overall rates of inflation that effectively cut real wages for these workers.",2003-10-01
One of the great difficulties in compiling price indexes is in adjusting them for changes in the quality of goods and services.,2003-10-01
"Casual evidence indicates that failure to make accurate adjustments can create a bias that could be quite large--indeed, King (2002) gives some heuristic illustrations that suggest that the true prices of some consumer durables have not risen at all since as far back as 1915!",2003-10-01
The statistical agencies compiling consumer prices in the United States--the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the consumer price index (CPI) and the Department of Commerce for the personal consumption expenditure deflator (PCE)--try valiantly to deal with these quality-change biases.,2003-10-01

"As the economy approached full employment, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the monetary policymaking arm of the Federal Reserve System, was faced with the classic problem of managing the mid-cycle slowdown--that is, of setting policy to help guide the economy toward sustainable growth without inflation.",2008-01-10

"Continued increases in the prices of energy and other commodities, together with high levels of resource utilization, kept the Committee on inflation alert.",2008-01-10
"But perhaps an even greater challenge was posed by a sharp and protracted correction in the U.S. housing market, which followed a multiyear boom in housing construction and house prices.",2008-01-10
"Since early 2007, financial market participants have been focused on the high and rising delinquency rates of subprime mortgages, especially those with adjustable interest rates (subprime ARMs).",2008-01-10
"Although poor underwriting and, in some cases, fraud and abusive practices contributed to the high rates of delinquency that we are now seeing in the subprime ARM market, the more fundamental reason for the sharp deterioration in credit quality was the flawed premise on which much subprime ARM lending was based: that house prices would continue to rise rapidly.",2008-01-10
"When house prices were increasing at double-digit rates, subprime ARM borrowers were able to build equity in their homes during the period in which they paid a (relatively) low introductory (or â€œteaserâ€) rate on their mortgages.",2008-01-10
"However, when declining affordability finally began to take its toll on the demand for homes and thus on house prices, borrowers could no longer rely on home-price appreciation to build equity; they were accordingly unable to refinance and found themselves locked into their subprime ARM contracts.",2008-01-10
"For example, even as delinquencies on subprime ARMs have soared, loss rates on subprime mortgages with fixed interest rates, though somewhat higher recently, remain in their historical range.",2008-01-10
"On the way up, expansive subprime lending increased the effective demand for housing, pushing up prices and stimulating construction activity.",2008-01-10
"On the way down, the withdrawal of this source of demand for housing has exacerbated the downturn, adding to the sharp decline in new homebuilding and putting downward pressure on house prices.",2008-01-10
"Investors have also been concerned that, by further weakening the housing sector, the problems in the subprime mortgage market may lead overall economic growth to slow.",2008-01-10
"Thus, banks too became subject to valuation uncertainty, as could be seen in their share prices and other market indicators such as quotes on credit default swaps.",2008-01-10
More-expensive and less-available credit seems likely to impose a measure of financial restraint on economic growth.,2008-01-10
"Thus, notwithstanding the effects of multi-billion dollar write-downs on the earnings and share prices of some large institutions, the banking system remains sound.",2008-01-10
The Federal Reserve accordingly has taken a number of steps to help markets return to more orderly functioning and to foster its macroeconomic objectives of maximum sustainable employment and price stability.,2008-01-10
"Broadly, the Federal Reserveâ€™s response has followed two tracks: efforts to support market liquidity and functioning and the pursuit of our macroeconomic objectives through monetary policy.",2008-01-10

"Recently, however, incoming information has suggested that the baseline outlook for real activity in 2008 has worsened and the downside risks to growth have become more pronounced.",2008-01-10
"Notably, the demand for housing seems to have weakened further, in part reflecting the ongoing problems in mortgage markets.",2008-01-10
"In addition, a number of factors, including higher oil prices, lower equity prices, and softening home values, seem likely to weigh on consumer spending as we move into 2008.",2008-01-10
Financial conditions continue to pose a downside risk to the outlook for growth.,2008-01-10
A second consequential risk to the growth outlook concerns the performance of the labor market.,2008-01-10
"Last weekâ€™s report on labor-market conditions in December was disappointing, as it showed an increase of 0.3 percentage point in the unemployment rate and a decline in private payroll employment.",2008-01-10
"Heretofore, the labor market has been a source of stability in the macroeconomic situation, with relatively steady gains in wage and salary income providing households the wherewithal to support moderate growth in real consumption spending.",2008-01-10
"Even as the outlook for real activity has weakened, there have been some important developments on the inflation front.",2008-01-10
"Most notably, the same increase in oil prices that may be a negative influence on growth is also lifting overall consumer prices and probably putting some upward pressure on core inflation measures as well.",2008-01-10
"Last year, food prices also increased exceptionally rapidly by recent standards, further boosting overall consumer price inflation.",2008-01-10
"Thus far, inflation expectations appear to have remained reasonably well anchored, and pressures on resource utilization have diminished a bit.",2008-01-10
"However, any tendency of inflation expectations to become unmoored or for the Fedâ€™s inflation-fighting credibility to be eroded could greatly complicate the task of sustaining price stability and reduce the central bankâ€™s policy flexibility to counter shortfalls in growth in the future.",2008-01-10
"Accordingly, in the months ahead we will be closely monitoring the inflation situation, particularly as regards inflation expectations.",2008-01-10

"Milton Friedman--whose effect on monetary policy, especially here at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, is legendary--is one with such sharply refined skills.",2001-10-11

"Simply put, financial markets work more efficiently when their participants do not have to waste effort inferring the stance of monetary policy from diffuse signals generated in the day-to-day implementation of policy.",2001-10-11
And being clear about that stance has not constrained our ability to adjust the stance of monetary policy in either direction.,2001-10-11
"In recent years, we have achieved a far better balance, in my judgment, between transparency and effective monetary policy implementation than we thought appropriate in the past.",2001-10-11

"Hence, we must assume that embodied in all products is some unit of output, and hence of price, that is recognizable to producers and consumers and upon which they will base their decisions.",2001-10-11
"Doubtless, we will develop new techniques of price measurement to unearth those units as the years go on.",2001-10-11
"It is crucial that we do, for inflation can destabilize an economy even if faulty price indexes fail to reveal it.",2001-10-11
"For all these conceptual uncertainties and measurement problems, a specific numerical inflation target would represent an unhelpful and false precision.",2001-10-11
"Rather, price stability is best thought of as an environment in which inflation is so low and stable over time that it does not materially enter into the decisions of households and firms.",2001-10-11
"Nonetheless, I cannot help but conclude that the progress that the Federal Reserve has achieved over the years in moving toward this old definition of price stability has contributed to the improvement in our nation's longer-term growth prospects that became evident in the latter part of the 1990s.",2001-10-11
"So, for the time being, our conventional measures of the overall price level will remain useful.",2001-10-11
But I also want to emphasize the importance of setting monetary policy as part of a longer-run strategy that provides guidance of how to juggle multiple targets in the short run while maintaining a focus on achieving price stability in the long run.,1996-09-08
"I will begin with a brief discussion of the objectives of monetary policy, then turn to the outlook issues that are, in my judgment, central to near-term policy decisions, and end with a few comments on one aspect of longer-run strategic considerations.",1996-09-08
"I include full employment, growth (meaning the growth in productive capacity), and price stability.",1996-09-08
Understanding this specialization will prevent us from expecting more from monetary policy than it can promise to deliver and help us better appreciate the singular nature of the long-run objective for monetary policy.,1996-09-08
"Economic theory, in the form of the long-run neutrality of money, tells us that monetary policy cannot affect the level or growth rate of output in the long run.",1996-09-08
So don't saddle monetary policy with responsibilities for stimulating the growth of productive capacity.,1996-09-08
If it were easy to produce more long-run growth simply by printing money we would have monetized our way to dramatically higher living standards a long time ago.,1996-09-08
"What monetary policy does do, according to economic theory, is set the rate of inflation in the long run.",1996-09-08
"As I said in my opening statement in my confirmation hearings, when it comes to assigning responsibility for inflation, the buck literally stops at the Federal Reserve.",1996-09-08
Price stability is therefore the singular and unique long-run objective for monetary policy.,1996-09-08
"Fiscal policy, on the other hand, can be an instrument of growth policy, through its effect on national saving via the structural budget deficit, through incentive effects on work, saving and investment via tax rates and tax structure, and through public investment in human capital and physical infrastructure.",1996-09-08
"While we should not overstate what fiscal policy can deliver on this score, we should remember where the levers for growth policy are located.",1996-09-08
"My reading is that both monetary and fiscal policies, via their influence on aggregate demand, affect output and employment in the short run.",1996-09-08
"In practice, recently and for the indefinite future, fiscal policy is dominated with the task of reducing the deficit, leaving the stabilization objective almost exclusively in the hands of the Federal Reserve.",1996-09-08
"Outlook Issues Challenging Monetary Policy Today There are two questions related to the current economic outlook that, in my view, challenge monetary policy in the near term.",1996-09-08
"First, in the absence of policy adjustment, is the economy slowing or likely to slow to trend quickly enough to stabilize the unemployment rate at its current level?",1996-09-08
"Second, is the current unemployment already so low that remaining at this level would trigger a steady increase in the rate of inflation?",1996-09-08
All have growth near 2% in the second half of 1996 and through 1997.,1996-09-08
"Of course, one has to be careful interpreting these forecasts, because some of the private sector forecasts that have growth slowing to trend do so in the context of an assumed modest tightening of monetary policy, but many suggest a slowing to trend without such an adjustment.",1996-09-08
I should note that growth itself does not cause inflation.,1996-09-08
"However, above-trend growth, without an accompanying increase in participation rates, implies further decline in the unemployment rate which may already be at or even below its full employment level.",1996-09-08
"A further decline in the unemployment rate, from its current level, would, in turn, increase the risk of an acceleration of inflation.",1996-09-08
"In that case, a slowdown to trend would not be sufficient to prevent an acceleration in inflation.",1996-09-08
This indicates we are below NAIRU and should expect a steady rise in the inflation rate going forward.,1996-09-08
"The problem with this conclusion is that we would have expected, in this case, some upward pressure on prices over the past two years.",1996-09-08
"I do not want to ignore the possibility that transitory favorable supply shocks can, for a while, offset the effect of a below-NAIRU unemployment rate on inflation.",1996-09-08
But I do not believe that special factors alone can explain away the tension between an unemployment rate persistently below traditional estimates of NAIRU and the stable to declining inflation over the past two years.,1996-09-08
"Indeed, I expect many don't appreciate how well behaved inflation has been over this period.",1996-09-08
"Over the year ended in the second quarter, most broad measures of inflation, both product and expenditure-side measures, have been near 2% and when measured net of food and energy, below 2%.",1996-09-08
"A couple of examples: For the chain-type GDP deflator, the inflation rate over this period was 2.2% and the last available reading, for the second quarter, was 2.2%.",1996-09-08
"For the Gross Domestic Purchases chain-type price index, the inflation rate over the last year was 2.0% and the rate in the second quarter was 2.1%.",1996-09-08
"In both of these cases, inflation was also lower in the year ended in the second quarter of 1996 than over the preceding year.",1996-09-08
"So inflation is quite modest, it has not evidenced any increase over the last year, and, in fact, has shown signs of further decline.",1996-09-08
"It might add that, net of food and energy, broad expenditure measures show inflation below 2% over the past year.",1996-09-08
"The CPI, the inflation measure which receives the most attention, is, admittedly, a bit of an outlier.",1996-09-08
"Its inflation rate is closer to 3% than to 2%, resulting in an unusually wide gap between the inflation rates for the CPI and other broad price indices.",1996-09-08
"Still, even in the case of the CPI, inflation is lower over the year ended in the second quarter than over the preceding year for both overall and core measures.",1996-09-08
"As a result of the recent inflation experience, estimation techniques which weight the current data more heavily (so-called time varying parameter estimation) suggest that NAIRU has declined recently and may be as low as 5 1 /2%.",1996-09-08
So one of the challenges to monetary policy is how to operate when there is a higher degree of uncertainty about where NAIRU is.,1996-09-08
I have emphasized throughout my career the importance of the expectations-augmented Phillips Curve in my view of the inflation process and its value as a forecasting tool.,1996-09-08
But the tension is there and we have to weigh the risk of higher inflation if the longer-run estimate of NAIRU proves correct against the potential that the recent stability in inflation reflects a change in structure that will persist.,1996-09-08
Tempering some of the optimism about NAIRU and recent inflation is evidence of at least a modest acceleration in wages and compensation.,1996-09-08
"This trend is of concern, although there are questions about whether or not it signals an upturn in price inflation.",1996-09-08
"Labor costs, of course, are based on total compensation not wages, so we might want, especially given the slowdown in benefit cost inflation, to keep our focus on the broader compensation measure rather than on wage change alone.",1996-09-08
"The question here is whether the current rate of increase in compensation remains consistent with stable price inflation, either because it is being accompanied, at least for a while, by a compression in profit margins or because it still remains low relative to trend productivity.",1996-09-08
"At any rate, the developments related to wages, compensation and productivity deserve particular scrutiny.",1996-09-08
"The economy continued to generate jobs at an impressive clip last month--indeed, at a pace faster than the trend growth of the labor force.",1996-09-08
"The unemployment rate dropped noticeably below the range over the past two years, to 5.1 %.",1996-09-08
"For some time now, many American workers have not fully shared in the fruits of our economic growth.",1996-09-08
"But the question is whether the recent wage gains will be real in terms of greater effective purchasing power, or whether the associated increases in costs of production will only be mirrored in an offsetting acceleration of prices.",1996-09-08
"The question is whether this process will continue in the months ahead, holding inflation in check.",1996-09-08
"But, there is no question that the latest data reinforce the sense that Chairman Greenspan expressed a couple of months ago that we are in a circumstance in which a prudent central bank must exercise heightened surveillance of the inflationary risks and stand ready to respond if necessary.",1996-09-08
Juggling Multiple Targets in the Short Run But this is just a single episode for monetary policy.,1996-09-08
"Let's assume, for the sake of the rest of my remarks, that growth slows to trend, the unemployment rate stabilizes at its current level, and inflation remains stable.",1996-09-08
What then for monetary policy?,1996-09-08
"There is, to be sure, no trade-off and hence no inconsistency between full employment and price stability in the long run.",1996-09-08
"Therefore, maximum employment (at least if interpreted as full employment or being at NAIRU) and price stability, the statutory mandate of the Federal Reserve, are compatible in the long run.",1996-09-08
Full employment can be achieved either with price stability or with positive stable inflation.,1996-09-08
"So the mandate, in my interpretation, does dictate that we move to price stability, because this is only there that we can achieve both objectives simultaneously.",1996-09-08
"That still leaves us the strategic question of how to juggle the goals of full employment and price stability in the short run when the initial conditions do involve a conflict among the ultimate objectives--for example, the current combination of modest, stable inflation and full employment.",1996-09-08
It is desirable that monetary policy respond to this challenge in a systematic way.,1996-09-08
This would allow the private sector to both anticipate where monetary policy is headed and retain confidence that the Federal Reserve remains focused on its long-run objective as it carries out its meeting-to-meeting policies.,1996-09-08
The Taylor Rule is a simple example of a strategy that juggles the two objectives in a disciplined manner without losing sight of the long-run price stability objective.,1996-09-08
The Taylor Rule varies the real federal funds rate relative to some equilibrium level in response to both the deviation of output from its full employment level and of inflation from its long-run target.,1996-09-08
"This rule, in effect, worries continuously about both output relative to potential and inflation relative to price stability.",1996-09-08
But the Taylor Rule helps illustrate some important aspects of monetary policy strategy.,1996-09-08
"The Taylor Rule would resolve the near-term conflict between objectives in the current economic environment by encouraging some slack in the economy and thereby ensuring downward pressure on inflation over time, as long as inflation were above the long-run inflation target, while still balancing along the way both the inflation and employment objectives.",1996-09-08
"Opportunistic Disinflation A couple of years ago, I gave the name ""opportunistic disinflation"" to an alternative strategy for bridging between short-run policy and long-run goals, a strategy that I observed the Federal Reserve to be following at the time.",1996-09-08
"Under this strategy, once inflation becomes modest, as today, Federal Reserve policy in the near term focuses on sustaining trend growth at full employment at the prevailing inflation rate.",1996-09-08
At this point the short-run priorities are twofold: sustaining the expansion and preventing an acceleration of inflation.,1996-09-08
"This is, nevertheless, a strategy for disinflation because it takes advantage of the opportunity of inevitable recessions and potential positive supply shocks to ratchet down inflation over time.",1996-09-08
Proponents of this strategy sometimes describe this approach as reducing inflation cycle-to-cycle or describe the economy as being one recession from price stability.,1996-09-08
"Under this strategy, if growth were to slow to trend, the unemployment rate were to remain where it is, and inflation were to remain stable, monetary policy would remain on hold, ready to respond aggressively to any acceleration of inflation, but otherwise prepared to be patient and accept the lower inflation that will accompany the next recession or favorable supply shock.",1996-09-08
So let me sum up how I look at the challenges facing monetary policy in the current economic environment and in light of the longer run strategic issues I have set out this evening.,1996-09-08
"In the near term, I believe we should be vigilant to insure that the progress made to lower inflation to the current level is sustained.",1996-09-08
"I am, as a result, focused on forecasts of near-term growth relative to trend as a forward-looking indicator of changes in utilization rates, on utilization rates themselves as forward-looking indicators of inflation pressures, on labor costs as a key factor in the transmission of demand pressure to price inflation, and, given the uncertainty about NAIRU, on readings of the current inflation rate.",1996-09-08
"In that spirit, I will provide a brief progress report on the economic recovery, as well as some remarks on the evolution of monetary policy.",2004-01-04
"Though officially the recession lasted only eight months, from March to November 2001, a period of economic underperformance began with the sharp decline in stock prices and business investment in mid-2000 and continued through the months leading up to the Iraq war this past spring.",2004-01-04
"In an effort to restore profitability in an environment of weak demand and nonexistent pricing power, businesses also worked hard to improve efficiency and cut costs.",2004-01-04
"These efforts have paid off in terms of remarkable increases in productivity, but, together with insufficient growth in aggregate demand, they also contributed to a significant decline in employment.",2004-01-04
"Indeed, the lag between the recovery in output and the recovery in employment has been significantly greater this time than it was after the 1990-91 downturn.",2004-01-04
"Monetary policy was deployed to support the weakening economy, as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) aggressively cut rates in 2001 and has continued its policy of accommodation since then.",2004-01-04
"As you know, the third quarter of the year displayed near-record levels of real economic growth, in the vicinity of 8 percent at an annual rate, and growth appears to have continued strong in the fourth quarter of 2003.",2004-01-04
"Private-sector forecasters generally expect real growth to be approximately 4 percent in 2004, and they foresee modest improvements in the unemployment rate this year and continued reductions in unemployment in 2005.",2004-01-04
"I think these predictions are broadly reasonable, and indeed I would not be surprised if the pace of real growth next year exceeded 4 percent.",2004-01-04
"With this generally upbeat scenario in mind, some observers in the markets and the media have questioned the appropriateness of the current stance of monetary policy.",2004-01-04
"More than two years after the recession trough, and following several quarters of strong growth, the historically normal pattern would be for the Fed to be well into the process of tightening policy by now.",2004-01-04
"The positive case for maintaining an accommodative monetary policy at this stage of the recovery has three elements, some of which will be familiar to many of you, at least in broad outline.",2004-01-04
"First, core inflation rates in the United States are as low today as they have been in forty years, and they have been trending downward.",2004-01-04
"For example, the twelve-month inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index, current-methods basis and excluding food and energy prices, was 2.7 percent at the recession trough in November 2001.",2004-01-04
This measure of core inflation fell to 2.0 percent as of November 2002 and to only 1.1 percent as of November 2003.,2004-01-04
"Other measures of core inflation, such as the one based on the chain price index for personal consumption expenditures, have displayed a similar pattern.",2004-01-04
"Inflation is not simply low; for my taste, it is very nearly at the bottom of the acceptable range for (measured) inflation.",2004-01-04
"In contrast, in previous episodes of recovery, inflation was above the range consistent with price stability, so that a tightening of monetary policy at an earlier stage of the expansion represented the prudent response to inflation risks.",2004-01-04
"Because inflation is so low today, monetary policy can afford to be more patient to ensure that the recovery is self-sustaining.",2004-01-04
The second unusual aspect of the current situation relevant for monetary policy is the truly remarkable increase in labor productivity that firms and workers have achieved in recent years.,2004-01-04
"Those productivity increases affect the inflation outlook in two related ways: first, by raising potential output and thus (for given growth in aggregate demand) the size of the output gap; and, second, by reducing the costs of production, which puts downward pressure on prices.",2004-01-04
"I will first address the effect of productivity on costs, returning later to the link of productivity and the output gap.",2004-01-04
"When the cost per hour of employing a worker rises more quickly than the worker's hourly productivity--the historically normal situation--then the dollar labor cost of producing each unit of output, the so-called unit labor cost, tends to rise.",2004-01-04
"Recently, however, labor productivity has grown even more quickly than the costs of employing workers, with the result that unit labor costs have declined in each of the past three years.",2004-01-04
"A decline in production costs must result in lower prices for final consumers, an increased price-cost markup for producers, or both.",2004-01-04
"In practice, both have occurred in recent years: Firms have passed on part of the reduction in costs on to final consumers in the form of lower (or more slowly rising) prices, and price-cost markups (as best we can measure them) have risen well above their historical averages.",2004-01-04
"To the extent that product-market competition erodes these markups, as is likely to occur over time, downward pressure will be exerted on the inflation rate, even if, as is likely, the recent declines in unit labor cost do not persist.2 The third unusual factor is the persistent softness of the labor market.",2004-01-04
"As I already noted, fully two years after the official recession trough, we are only just beginning to see significant gains in employment.",2004-01-04
"Of course, the unemployment rate, at about 6 percent of the labor force, is not exceptionally high by historical standards, and one can debate the degree to which structural change and other factors may have affected the level of employment that can be sustained without overheating the economy.",2004-01-04
"However, my sense is that, when one looks at the full range of information available, the labor market looks (if anything) weaker than a 6 percent unemployment rate suggests.",2004-01-04
"Similarly, the ratio of employment to the working-age population, a statistic that reflects both those who become unemployed and those who leave the labor force, has fallen significantly, by 2.8 percentage points between its peak in April 2000 and its trough this past September.",2004-01-04
"The tendency of recent job losers to leave the labor force likely masks some of the effects of job cuts on the unemployment rate, so that the current measured level of unemployment may understate the extent of job loss or the difficulty of finding new work.",2004-01-04
"Of course, a labor market that is slack and improving only slowly is likely to produce continued slow growth in nominal wages, contributing to continued moderate growth in costs.",2004-01-04
"Why has the labor market remained relatively weak, despite increasingly rapid growth in output?",2004-01-04
"Although many factors have affected the rate of job creation, I concluded in my earlier analysis that the rapid rate of productivity growth, already discussed in relation to unit labor costs, has also been an important reason for the slow pace of recovery in the labor market.",2004-01-04
"All else equal, strong productivity gains allow firms to meet a given level of demand with fewer employees.",2004-01-04
"Thus, for given growth in aggregate spending, a higher rate of productivity growth implies a slower rate of growth in employment.3 To summarize, then, the current economic situation has three unusual aspects, which together (in my view) rationalize the current stance of monetary policy.",2004-01-04
"First, inflation is historically low, perhaps at the bottom of the acceptable range, and has recently continued its decline.",2004-01-04
"Second, rapid productivity growth has led to actual declines in nominal production costs, which reduce current and future inflationary pressures.",2004-01-04
"Finally, the labor market remains soft, reflecting the fact that growth in aggregate demand has been so far insufficient to absorb the increases in aggregate supply afforded by higher productivity.",2004-01-04
A soft labor market will keep a lid on the growth in the cost of employing workers.,2004-01-04
"An accommodative monetary policy is needed, in my view, to support the ongoing recovery, particularly in the labor market.",2004-01-04
"At the same time, the risks of policy accommodation seem low, as inflation is low and inflation pressures seem quite subdued.",2004-01-04
"Citing factors such as the rise in commodity prices and the decline of the dollar, a number of observers have warned that the Federal Reserve's policies risk re-igniting inflation.",2004-01-04
"Achieving price stability in the United States was an historic accomplishment, and preserving that legacy is crucially important.",2004-01-04
"I say that not only because I think that price stability promotes long-run growth and efficiency, which I do, but also because I believe that low inflation and well-anchored inflation expectations are critical to maintaining economic stability in the short run.",2004-01-04
"Price stability is of utmost importance to the nation's economic health, and I believe that the FOMC will do whatever is necessary to be sure that inflation remains well contained.",2004-01-04
"With that preface, I will address briefly a few concerns of those who worry that inflation is poised to rise, beginning with the recent behavior of commodity prices.",2004-01-04
"A number of commodity price indexes have indeed risen sharply over the past couple of years, including a large jump in the past several months.",2004-01-04
"This acceleration has been broadly mirrored in the behavior of the core producer price indexes (PPIs) for crude and intermediate materials, probably the best and most comprehensive measures of prices at early stages of processing.",2004-01-04
Do these developments imply a significant increase in inflation risk at the level of the final consumer?,2004-01-04
"First, the recent movements in commodity prices are hardly surprising; they are in fact quite normal for this stage of the business cycle.",2004-01-04
"The acceleration in the core PPI for crude materials that we have seen is about what should have been expected, given the increases that have occurred recently in both domestic and worldwide economic activity.4 The increase in the demand for commodities from China alone has been substantial; for example, that country's share of world copper consumption is estimated to have risen from less than 5 percent in 1990 to 20 percent in 2003.",2004-01-04
"The much more moderate acceleration in intermediate goods prices can likewise be traced to the increase in economic activity, with some additional effect coming from the decline in the dollar and the indirect impact of increases in energy prices.",2004-01-04
"Second, the direct effects of commodity price inflation on consumer inflation are empirically minuscule, both because raw materials costs are a small portion of total cost and because part of any increase in the cost of materials tends to be absorbed in the margins of final goods producers and distributors.",2004-01-04
"Accelerations in commodity prices comparable to or larger than the most recent one occurred following the 1981-82 and 1990-91 recessions, as well as in 1986-87 and 1999, with no noticeable impact on inflation at the consumer level.5 A reasonable rule of thumb is that a permanent 10 percent increase in raw materials prices will lead to perhaps a 0.7 percent increase in the price of intermediate goods and to less than a 0.1 percent increase in consumer prices.",2004-01-04
"Thus the recent acceleration in commodity prices, even if it were to persist (and futures prices suggest that it will not), would likely add only a tenth or two to the core inflation rate.",2004-01-04
"In short, rising commodity prices are a better signal of strengthening economic activity than of inflation at the consumer level.",2004-01-04
Two specific commodity prices that often command attention are the prices of gold and crude petroleum.,2004-01-04
"The price of gold has increased roughly 60 percent since its low in April 2001, from about $255 per ounce to about $410 per ounce.",2004-01-04
"Gold also represents a safe haven investment, however, and I agree that there have been periods in the past when the fear that drove investors into gold was the fear of inflation.",2004-01-04
"But gold prices also respond to geopolitical tensions; these tensions have certainly heightened since 2001 and, in my view, can account for the bulk of the recent increase in the real price of gold.",2004-01-04
"Oil prices are relatively high, in the range of $33/barrel, but they have been elevated for most of the past four years, despite a broadly disinflationary environment.",2004-01-04
"According to futures markets, oil prices are expected to decline gradually over the next two years, despite accelerating economic activity, as new supplies are brought on line.",2004-01-04
"Of course, there is considerable uncertainty about what the price of oil will do, given the possibility of supply disruptions.",2004-01-04
"But if it follows the course projected by the futures market, the price of oil should have a modest disinflationary effect on overall consumer prices in the next couple of years.",2004-01-04
Let me turn now to the recent depreciation of the dollar and its implications for inflation.,2004-01-04
"Moreover, the direct effects of dollar depreciation on inflation, like those of commodity price increases, appear to be relatively small.",2004-01-04
"Perhaps more importantly, however, the evidence suggests that foreign producers tend to absorb most of the effect of changes in the value of the dollar rather than ""passing through"" these effects to the prices they charge U.S. consumers.",2004-01-04
"The extent of passthrough also appears to have declined over time, suggesting that foreign producers also lack ""pricing power"" in the current low-inflation environment in the United States.",2004-01-04
"Overall, on rough estimates, a 10 percent decline in the broad value of the dollar would be expected to add between one and three tenths to the level of core consumer prices (not the inflation rate), spread out over a period of time.",2004-01-04
"I haven't said anything yet about the rate of growth of the money supply, another indicator that is sometimes cited by those concerned about inflation, largely because there is not too much to say.",2004-01-04
"Growth in standard monetary measures such as the base and M2 has been moderate (and declining) in recent years, certainly well within expected ranges given the growth of nominal GDP and normal variation in velocity.",2004-01-04
"For example, for 2003 as a whole, growth in both the monetary base and M2 should be about equal to growth in nominal GDP.",2004-01-04
"Even should money growth rates accelerate, however, I would caution against making strong inferences about the likely behavior of inflation, except in the very long run.",2004-01-04
"Money growth has not proven to be especially useful for predicting inflation in the short run, in part because various institutional factors unrelated to monetary policy often affect the growth rate of money.",2004-01-04
"A striking example of the way special factors can affect money growth rates is the fact that M2 growth has actually been sharply negative, at about -5 percent at an annual rate, for the past three months for which data are available.",2004-01-04
"Certainly, this short-term decline in broad money is not to be taken as evidence of tight monetary policy!6 To summarize, 2003 seems to have marked the turning point for the U. S. economy, and we have reason to be optimistic that 2004 will see even more growth and continued progress in reducing unemployment.",2004-01-04
"The Federal Reserve enters 2004 with monetary policy that is unusually accommodative in historical terms, relative to the stage of the business cycle.",2004-01-04
"That accommodation is justified, I believe, by the current very low level of inflation, and by the productivity gains and the weakness in the labor market, both of which suggest that inflation is likely to remain subdued.",2004-01-04
"In my view, weighing the relative costs of the upside and downside risks also favors accommodation; in particular, it is important that we ensure, as best we can, that the current expansion will become self-sustaining and that the inflation rate does not fall further.",2004-01-04
"On the other side, as I have already noted, the achievement of price stability must not and will not be jeopardized.",2004-01-04
"We at the Federal Reserve will closely monitor developments in prices and wages, as well as conditions in the labor market and the broader economy, for any sign of incipient inflation.",2004-01-04

"June 18, 2022 Lessons Learned on Normalizing Monetary Policy Governor Christopher J. Waller At â€œMonetary Policy at a Crossroads,â€ a panel discussion hosted by the Dallas Society for Computational Economics, Dallas, Texas Share Watch Live Thank you, Meredith and Cullum and thank you to the Society for the invitation to speak to you today.",2022-06-18
"This week, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) took another significant step toward achieving our inflation objective by raising the Federal Funds rate target by 75 basis points.",2022-06-18
"The Fed is ""all in"" on re-establishing price stability, and part of that effort involves understanding the forces that have boosted inflation and also examining how policymakers responded.",2022-06-18
"Today, I intend to look back on monetary policy in 2020 and 2021, as I have before in recent speeches, but go a bit further and try to discern some lessons learned.1 In addition to the Federal Reserve's emergency lending programs, the monetary policy actions taken during this time were deemed extraordinary.",2022-06-18
"Structural changes in the economy have tended to lower interest rates and limit the room that the Federal Reserve will have to cut rates during a slowdown.2 I hope we never have another two years like 2020 and 2021, but because of the low-interest-rate environment we now face, I believe that even in a typical recession there is a decent chance that we will be considering policy decisions in the future similar to those we made over the past two years.",2022-06-18
"Besides supporting smooth market functioning, asset purchases also aided in the transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.",2022-06-18
"Over the course of 2020, the Fed's liquidity and credit facilities saw reduced demand and most of the emergency programs were decommissioned around year end.",2022-06-18
"Perhaps the most straightforward takeaway for monetary policy is that in times of severe stress, lending facilities, along with sharp cuts to the federal funds rate and the introduction of large-scale asset purchases, are very effective in reviving the economy.",2022-06-18
"There are some other lessons, I think, from the experience of tightening monetary policy, a process which was put in motion by the guidance that the FOMC issued in 2020 about how long it would keep the federal funds rate at the effective lower bound and continue asset purchases.",2022-06-18
"In September and December of 2020, the FOMC provided criteria or conditions in the meeting statement that would need to be met before the FOMC would consider raising interest rates and begin to reduce asset purchases, respectively.",2022-06-18
I mention this distinction because some have argued that the FOMC's new strategy was a factor that led the Committee to wait too long to begin tightening monetary policy.,2022-06-18
"In early 2021, the Committee began noting whether the economy was making progress toward our employment and inflation goals, and thus getting closer to decisions on unwinding our highly accommodative policy.",2022-06-18
"For asset purchases, the Committee declared that tapering would wait ""until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals.",2022-06-18
"""4 Meanwhile, the FOMC said that it would keep rates near zero until our employment goal had been reached and until inflation had reached 2 percent and was ""on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.",2022-06-18
"In November and December 2020, the unemployment rate was 6.7 percent and inflation seemed to be in check: 12-month personal consumption expenditures inflation was declining, and core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food prices, was more or less steady at 1.5 percent.",2022-06-18
The Summary of Economic Projections by FOMC participants in December 2020 had the unemployment rate moving down to 4.2 percent at the end of 2022 and inflation moving up to 2 percent only in 2023.,2022-06-18
Inflation averaging doesn't define how much above 2 percent is moderate and how long some value of elevated inflation should be tolerated.,2022-06-18
"Then, later that month, data indicated inflation was accelerating, so the Committee hastened the pace of tapering at the December meeting, making a plan to wind down purchases by early March.",2022-06-18
"Between December and March of this year inflation data came in very elevated, and at that point there was no question that inflation had been above 2 percent for ""some time.""",2022-06-18
"Given continued improvement in the labor market and the high inflation readings, the Committee began raising interest rates in March, as soon as asset purchases were completed.",2022-06-18
"However, if we had less restrictive tapering criteria and had started tapering sooner, the Committee could have had more flexibility on when to begin raising rates.6 So, by requiring substantial further progress toward maximum employment to even begin the process of tightening policy, one might argue that it locked the Committee into holding the policy rate at the zero lower bound longer than was optimal.",2022-06-18
It can be argued that this meant getting the economy back to its 2019 state with very low unemployment and inflation near 2 percent.,2022-06-18
"In closing, I hope that our country is not faced with another crisis as severe as the one precipitated by COVID, and that the Fed is not faced with the challenges of setting monetary policy under such conditions.",2022-06-18

"February 21, 2020 Financial Markets and Monetary Policy: Is There a Hall of Mirrors Problem?",2020-02-21
"Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the 2020 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, sponsored by the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, New York, New York Share Thank you to the conference organizers for inviting me here to discuss what former Chair Bernanke has famously referred to as a ""hall of mirrors"" problem: a situation in which a central bank's reaction function and financial market prices interact in economically suboptimal and potentially destabilizing ways.1 In my remarks today, I will lay out the way I think about the interplay between financial markets and monetary policy, with a focus on how I myself seek to integrate noisy but often correlated signals about the economy that I glean from models, surveys, and financial markets.2 Three Observations I begin with three unobjectionable observations.",2020-02-21
"First, because of Friedman's long and variable lags, monetary policy should beâ€”and, at the Fed, isâ€”forward looking.",2020-02-21
"Policy decisions made today will have no effect on today's inflation or unemployment rates, so good policy needs to assess where the economic fundamentals are going tomorrow to calibrate appropriate policy today.",2020-02-21
"Thus, central banks and financial markets are looking at the same data on macro fundamentals to make inferences about the future path of the economy, and, of course, any decisions on the policy path made by the central bank will influence asset prices through the discount factor.",2020-02-21
So optimal monetary policy will (almost) always be correlated with asset prices.,2020-02-21
"Second, because key variables that are crucial inputs for conducting monetary policyâ€”such as r*, u*, and expected inflation, to name just threeâ€”are both unobserved and time varying, responsible monetary policy requires informed views about how these variables evolve over time as well as a humility and an appreciation for the uncertainties surrounding baseline views, however well informed they might be.",2020-02-21
"Third, when trying to make an inference about unobserved variables like r* or expected inflation, it is generally a good idea to seek data from multiple signals correlated with the variable of interest, so long as the signals themselves are not perfectly correlated with one another.",2020-02-21
"Think of this third unobjectionable observation as a sort of ""model averaging"" or ""triangulation"" principle of robust inference in a noisy and complex environment.3 Data Dependence As I have written before, monetary policy needs to beâ€”and, at the Fed, isâ€” ""data dependent"" in two distinct ways.4 Policy should be data dependent in the sense that incoming data indicate the position of the economy relative to the ultimate objectives of price stability and maximum employment.",2020-02-21
"This information on where the economy is relative to the goals of monetary policy is an important input into standard interest rate feedback rules, such as those introduced by John Taylor in 1993 and ones that continue today to inform monetary policy decisions at the Fed and at other central banks.5 Monetary policy, however, also needs to be data dependent in the second senseâ€”that incoming data contain signalsâ€”that can enable the central bank to update its estimates of r* and u* in order to obtain its best estimate of the destination to which the economy is heading.",2020-02-21
"As I mentioned a moment ago, a challenge for policymakers is that key variables that are essential inputs to monetary policyâ€”such as u*, r*, and expected inflationâ€”cannot be observed directly and must be inferred from observed data.",2020-02-21
"And as is indicated in the Summary of Economic Projections, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants have, over the past seven years, repeatedly revised down their estimates of both u* and r* as unemployment fell and as real interest rates remained well below previous estimates of neutral without the rise in inflation those earlier estimates would have predicted.",2020-02-21
"In addition to u* and r*, an important input into any monetary policy assessment is the state of inflation expectations.",2020-02-21
"One of the robust messages from the DSGE (dynamic stochastic general equilibrium) literature on optimal monetary policy is that, away from the effective lower bound, optimal monetary policy will not eliminate all inflation volatilityâ€”there are always shocksâ€”but will, under rational expectations (RE), deliver average, and under RE, expected, inflation equal to the target.",2020-02-21
"Since the late 1990s, inflation expectations appear to have been stable and well anchored in the neighborhood of our 2 percent goal.",2020-02-21
"However, like r* and u*, inflation expectations are not directly observable and so must be inferred from data.",2020-02-21
Financial Data and Monetary Policy Let me now discuss in more detail how I use a form of model averaging to combine financial market data with data from surveys and econometric models to inform my thinking about the evolution of two key inputs to monetary policy: r* and long-run expected inflation.,2020-02-21
"To be sure, financial market signals are noisy, and day-to-day movements in asset prices are unlikely to tell us much about the cyclical or structural position of the economy, let alone r* and expected inflation.",2020-02-21
"Signals derived from financial market data, when combined with signals revealed from surveys of households and firms along with the filtered estimates from econometric models, can together provide valuable and reasonably robust foundations for real-time inference about the direction of travel in r* and expected inflation.",2020-02-21
"For example, a ""straight read"" of interest rate futures prices provides one source of high-frequency information about the destination for the federal funds rate expected by market participants.",2020-02-21
The destination for the federal funds rate implied by a straight read of futures prices is in turn the sum of the market-implied r* plus market-implied expected inflation.,2020-02-21
But these signals from interest rate futures are only a pure measure of the expected policy rate path under the assumption of a zero risk premium.,2020-02-21
"For this reason, it is useful to compare policy rate paths derived from market prices with the path obtained from surveys of market participants, which, while subject to measurement error, should not be contaminated with a term premium.",2020-02-21
"But when there is a divergence between the path or destination for the policy rate implied by the surveys and a straight read of interest rate derivatives prices, I place at least as much weight on the survey evidenceâ€”for example, derived from the surveys of primary dealers and market participants conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New Yorkâ€”as I do on the estimates obtained from market prices.",2020-02-21
"Finally, as another reality check, I, of course, always consult the latest estimate of r* produced by the Laubach and Williams (2003) unobservable components state-space model, which, I should point out, includes no information on asset prices other than the short-term nominal interest rate itself.6 Quotes from the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) market can provide valuable information about both r* and expected inflation.",2020-02-21
"TIPS market data, together with nominal Treasury yields, can be used to construct measures of ""breakeven inflation"" or inflation compensation that provide a noisy signal of market expectations of future inflation.",2020-02-21
"But, again, a straight read of breakeven inflation based on TIPS curve forward real rates needs to be augmented with a model to filter out the liquidity and risk premium components that place a wedge between inflation compensation and expected inflation.",2020-02-21
"It is again useful to compare estimates of expected inflation derived from breakeven inflation data with estimates of expected inflation obtained from surveysâ€”for example, the expected inflation over the next 5 to 10 years from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers.",2020-02-21
"Market- and survey-based estimates of expected inflation are correlated, but, again, when there is a divergence between the two, I place at least as much weight on the survey evidence as on the market-derived estimates.",2020-02-21
"Again, here I also consult time-series models of underlying inflation, such as Stock and Watson (2007) and Cecchetti and others (2017), presented at the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum in 2017.7 At the Fed, the staff have estimated a state-space model decomposition of the common factor that drives a number of different measures of inflation expectations.",2020-02-21
"As I look at all of this evidence from market signals, surveys, and econometric models, I judge that inflation expectations reside at the low end of the range I consider consistent with our price-stability goal of 2 percent personal consumption expenditure inflation in the long run.",2020-02-21
"In both of the examples I have just discussed, the medium-frequency evolution of market-based, survey-based, and model-based estimates of r* and expected inflation have, over time, tended to move broadly together.",2020-02-21
"When high-frequency market signals diverge from the survey- and model-based estimates, the potential benefit from increasing the weight on a signal derived from a forward-looking asset price versus backward estimates from models and slowly evolving surveys must be balanced against the cost of treating the noise in the asset price as a signal.",2020-02-21
"Although I will touch on global imbalances, I would like to focus on globalizationâ€™s potential influence on inflation and the associated implications for monetary policy.",2006-06-16
"It seems a natural focus for a policymaker at a central bank, and, indeed, several of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) have also addressed this issue in recent months.1 As you would see from reading their remarks, no consensus has yet emerged about how globalization has been influencing recent inflation developments, and part of my intention today is to illustrate some of the considerable challenges that are involved in attempting to identify the extent to which the recent pickup in the pace of global economic integration has influenced inflation dynamics in the United States.2 Of course, the trend toward greater international integration of product and financial markets has been established for quite a while; the share of U.S. economic activity involved in international trade (measured by nominal exports plus imports as a share of nominal gross domestic product) has been rising since the early 1970s.",2006-06-16
"Although inflation is ultimately a monetary phenomenon, it seems natural to expect, as others have argued, that these developments would have exerted some downward pressure on inflation in the United States.",2006-06-16
"However, the extent of the disinflationary effect of this shift in the pace of globalization is less obvious.",2006-06-16
"In addition, the significant expansion of production in China and elsewhere has put substantial upward pressure on the prices of oil and other commodities, many of which are imported for use as inputs to production in the United States.",2006-06-16
"Indeed, the effects of globalization on domestic inflation need not even be negative, especially in todayâ€™s environment of strong global growth.",2006-06-16
"At a research conference on modeling inflation held at the Federal Reserve Board last fall, none of the papers even touched on issues related to globalization.",2006-06-16
"And, although some new and interesting research is emerging from places like the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements, much of this work is still quite preliminary.4 Nevertheless, the existing research does highlight several channels through which globalization might have helped to hold down domestic inflation in recent years.",2006-06-16
"These channels include the direct and indirect effects on domestic inflation of lower import prices, a heightened sensitivity of domestic inflation to foreign demand conditions (and perhaps less sensitivity to domestic demand conditions), downward pressure on domestic wage growth, and upward pressure on domestic productivity growth.5 In trying to clarify my own thinking about the likely magnitude of these effects, I find that a useful starting point is a simple reduced-form equation that attempts to explain movements in inflation and then to ask whether and how the statistical relationships embedded in this equation have been affected by globalization.",2006-06-16
"It relates core consumer price inflation--using, say, the index for core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) or the core consumer price index (CPI)--to resource utilization, lagged inflation, changes in relative prices of food and energy, and changes in relative import prices.",2006-06-16
"First, we can look for influences that are directly controlled for in the model--notably the influence on domestic inflation of changes in import prices.",2006-06-16
"And, finally, we can look for evidence of model errors that would be consistent with the hypothesis that globalization has been restraining inflation.",2006-06-16
I will start with the import price channel--the hypothesis that increased globalization has depressed import prices and thus domestic inflation.,2006-06-16
"Importantly, the estimated strength of this channel should capture not only the direct effects of import prices on the cost of living in the United States but, also, at least a portion of the indirect effects of actual and potential import competition on the prices of goods produced domestically.",2006-06-16
"In the reduced-form model that Iâ€™ve just described, the effects of import prices on inflation show up quite clearly; furthermore, the estimated effects appear to have increased over time, with the increase apparently stemming primarily from the upward trend in the share of imported consumer goods in household spending.6 We can use the model to get a rough idea of how relative changes in import prices have influenced domestic inflation by simulating how core consumer prices would have behaved if relative import prices had instead remained constant.",2006-06-16
"In particular, the increase in core import prices since the mid-1990s has averaged about 1-1/2 percentage points less per year than the increase in core consumer prices.",2006-06-16
"According to the model simulation, which also builds in the associated reduction in inflation expectations, the direct and indirect effects of this decline in the relative price of imports held down core inflation by between 1/2 and 1 percentage point per year over this period, an estimated effect that is substantially larger than it would have been in earlier decades.",2006-06-16
"However, much of the decline in import prices during this period was probably driven by movements in exchange rates and the effects of technological change on goods prices rather than by the growing integration of world markets.7 In addition, import prices have risen at about the same average pace as core consumer prices over the past several years and thus no longer appear to be acting as a significant restraint on inflation in the United States.",2006-06-16
"This step-up in the rate of change of import prices obviously reflects, to some extent, recent movements in the dollar, especially its depreciation in 2004.",2006-06-16
"However, it also reflects large increases in the prices of a number of imported commodities, which have been attributed in part to the rapid expansion of activity in China and other Asian countries.",2006-06-16
A second hypothesis is that increases in global capacity have held down U.S. inflation in recent years by limiting the ability of U.S. producers to raise prices in response to increases in the domestic costs of production.,2006-06-16
"But it does raise a broader issue about the determinants of inflation--that is, whether U.S. inflation is now less sensitive to domestic demand pressures and more sensitive to foreign demand conditions than it was earlier.",2006-06-16
"In the context of the inflation model, we can examine this issue in two ways.",2006-06-16
"First, we can look for evidence that the coefficients on the domestic output or unemployment gaps have fallen over time.",2006-06-16
"Second, we can add a measure of foreign excess demand to the model to see whether it helps to explain domestic inflation in recent years.",2006-06-16
"With regard to the first test, we do find evidence that the coefficient on the unemployment gap has fallen in the United States.",2006-06-16
"Of course, globalization is not the only potential explanation for this result, and numerous other researchers have cited persistently low inflation and the improved credibility of monetary policy as having played a more important role.",2006-06-16
"In fact, in rolling regressions, the timing of the decline in the sensitivity of inflation to the unemployment gap appears to be too early to be associated with the more recent acceleration in the pace of globalization.",2006-06-16
This aspect of the globalization hypothesis would be bolstered if the decline in the sensitivity of inflation to domestic demand was accompanied by an increased sensitivity to foreign demand.,2006-06-16
"Efforts to find such a link have met with mixed results, with some researchers having found large effects and others having found no effect.8 Our own analysis of this issue indicates that these results are sensitive to how the foreign output gap is defined and to how the inflation model is specified, suggesting that any effect may not be especially strong.",2006-06-16
One hypothesis is that the increase in the supply of low-skilled workers associated with the emergence of China and other East Asian countries as low-cost centers of production has put downward pressure on the growth of nominal wages in the United States.,2006-06-16
"However, a model of changes in aggregate labor compensation that is similar in structure to the price-inflation model that I described earlier does not detect a stable relationship between measures of globalization (for example, import price changes or the BIS estimates of the foreign output gap) and aggregate wage dynamics in the United States.",2006-06-16
"Of course, several purely domestic factors could help to account for any shortfall, such as the aftereffects of the unusually sluggish recovery in job growth early in this expansion or a possible downward drift in the nonaccelerating-inflation rate of unemployment.",2006-06-16
"In support of this link, some cross-section studies have found a relationship between industry wage growth and import penetration, while the research on wage inequality tends to relate some of the relative decline in wages of low-skilled workers to trade, although in both types of studies the effects are generally relatively small.9 Similarly, research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows a modest relationship between exchange rate fluctuations and wage growth, with larger effects evident for the wages of lower-skilled workers.10 A second possibility is that globalization has restrained unit labor costs by raising productivity.",2006-06-16
Increasing volumes of trade should bolster productivity as economies concentrate their resources in those sectors in which they are relatively more efficient.,2006-06-16
But I have seen little direct evidence on the extent to which globalization may have boosted aggregate productivity growth in the United States in recent years.,2006-06-16
"Nevertheless, research at the Board finds that multinational corporations, which may have the greater opportunities to realize efficiencies by shifting production locations, accounted for a disproportionate share of aggregate productivity growth in the late 1990s.11 And some microeconomic studies have found a relationship between global engagement and productivity at the firm level.12 Thus, it seems possible that the persistently high growth rates of multifactor productivity in recent years may partly be due to the productivity-enhancing effects of globalization.",2006-06-16
"In this regard, I would note that a potential shortcoming of my approach to assessing the effects of globalization on inflation is that these effects may be too recent to be captured adequately by the data.",2006-06-16
"That is, it may be too soon for globalization to have generated statistically observable changes in the parameter estimates or structure of the standard inflation model.",2006-06-16
"Nonetheless, if the influence of globalization on inflation is as substantial as many claim, we might have expected the standard model to have had difficulty in predicting recent inflation trends.",2006-06-16
"For example, if recent increases in world labor supply are restraining domestic unit labor costs to a significant degree or if there are other important influences on inflation that are related to globalization but difficult to quantify in the context of the standard model, we would expect to have seen sizable model errors over the past several years.",2006-06-16
"Again, the evidence points to some limited influence of globalization on U.S. inflation.",2006-06-16
"If we use out-of-sample dynamic simulations of a model for core PCE price inflation estimated from 1985 through the end of 2001, we find that, although the model overpredicts inflation over the past several years, the errors average only 0.1 to 0.2 percentage point per year, considerably less than one might have expected given the anecdotes in the popular press.",2006-06-16
"In contrast, the forecast errors from a model of core CPI inflation are larger (averaging roughly 1/2 to 1 percentage point per year since mid-2001), perhaps suggestive of some influence from globalization.",2006-06-16
"My own assessment is that, quite naturally, the greater integration of the U.S. economy into a rapidly evolving world economy has affected the dynamics of inflation determination.",2006-06-16
"But, for the most part, the evidence seems to suggest that to date the effects have been gradual and limited: a greater role for the direct and indirect effects of import prices; possibly some damping of unit labor costs, though less so for prices from this channel judging from high profit margins; and potentially a smaller effect of the domestic output gap and a greater effect of foreign output gaps, but here too the evidence is far from conclusive.",2006-06-16
"In particular, the entry of China, India, and others into the global trading system probably has exerted a modest disinflationary force on prices in the United States in recent years.",2006-06-16
"Moreover, we should recognize that these disinflationary effects could dissipate or even be reversed in coming years.",2006-06-16
"For example, the fact that China and some other emerging-market economies have resisted upward pressure on their exchange rates and are running trade surpluses has undoubtedly contributed to their disinflationary effects on the rest of the world.",2006-06-16
"The prices of their exports are lower than they would be if market forces were given greater scope in foreign exchange markets, and they are supplying more goods and services to the rest of the world than they themselves are demanding.",2006-06-16
"As individuals in these countries are increasingly drawn to investing at home and consuming more of their wealth and as their real wages catch up to past productivity gains, the upward pressures on their currencies will intensify, their demand will come into better alignment with their capacity to produce, cost advantages will decline, and these economies will exert less, if any, downward pressure on inflation in the United States.",2006-06-16
"This observation brings me to my final point, which is about monetary policy.",2006-06-16
"In one sense, a more open economy may be more forgiving as shortfalls or excesses in demand are partly absorbed by other countries through adjustments of our imports and exports.",2006-06-16
"And, to the extent that the United States can draw upon world capacity, the inflationary effect of an increase in aggregate demand might be damped for a time.",2006-06-16
"But we are also subject to inflationary forces from abroad, including those that might accompany a shift to a more sustainable pattern of global spending and production, or those that might emanate from rising cost and price pressures.",2006-06-16
"Moreover, a smaller response of inflation to domestic demand also implies that reducing inflation once it rose could be difficult and costly.",2006-06-16
"For example, if financial market participants thought that the FOMC was not dedicated to maintaining long-run price stability--a notion that I can assure you is not correct--they would be less willing to hold dollar-denominated assets, and the resulting decline in the dollar would tend to add to inflationary pressures.",2006-06-16
"Clearly, policymakers need to factor into their decisions the implications of globalization for the dynamics of the determination of inflation and output.",2006-06-16
"In the end, however, policymakers here and abroad cannot lose sight of a fundamental truth: In a world of separate currencies that can fluctuate against each other over time, each countryâ€™s central bank determines its inflation rate.",2006-06-16
I will comment briefly on the outlook for the economy and then turn to monetary policy.1 Near-Term Outlook Our economy has grown at an average annual rate of only about 2 percent since the recovery began exactly four years ago.,2013-06-27
"That modest pace is notably weaker than the experience of past recoveries would have predicted, even accounting for the depth and duration of the Great Recession.2 Since 2009, the question has been when the recovery will decisively take hold and begin to deliver the higher levels of growth that are needed to put people back to work more quickly.",2013-06-27
"Against that background, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met last week, and, among other tasks, each of the 19 members of the Committee submitted individual economic projections for growth, unemployment, and inflation for 2013 through 2015.",2013-06-27
FOMC participants generally expect an acceleration of the recovery through 2013 and 2014 and continued strong growth in 2015.,2013-06-27
"I would point in particular to the housing sector, which in prior recoveries has been an important engine of growth.",2013-06-27
"For the first two years of the current recovery, housing contributed nothing to growth, as housing investment hovered at extremely low levels.",2013-06-27
"House prices declined sharply through most of 2011, wiping out about half of home equity and restraining consumer spending.",2013-06-27
House prices are up more than 10 percent over the past 12 months.,2013-06-27
But overall trends suggest to me that the housing recovery can continue for many years and become an important contributor to growth.,2013-06-27
Growth would be higher this year but for U.S. fiscal policy.,2013-06-27
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that federal tax increases and spending cuts will slow the pace of real gross domestic product (GDP) growth about 1-1/2 percentage points this year.3 Tight fiscal policy may also be preventing faster reductions in unemployment.,2013-06-27
I have been surprised by how well consumer spending--and private domestic final demand more generally--have held up in the face of this pronounced fiscal drag.,2013-06-27
"In the first quarter of this year, consumer spending and private domestic final demand rose at an annual rate of just above 2-1/2 percent.",2013-06-27
More-recent indicators of household and business spending suggest that private demand is continuing to advance at a reasonable clip despite the fiscal tightening.,2013-06-27
"Let's turn to monetary policy, starting with the dual mandate, pursuant to which the Congress directs the Federal Reserve to conduct monetary policy so as to foster stable prices and full employment.",2013-06-27
"Dual Mandate--Inflation Inflation is currently running below the FOMC's 2 percent long-term objective for personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price inflation, and these readings have our attention.",2013-06-27
But inflation often fluctuates for transitory reasons.,2013-06-27
Other factors point to a gradual increase in inflation.,2013-06-27
"While some measures of longer-term inflation expectations have moved down, others remain more stable.",2013-06-27
Most FOMC participants anticipate that inflation will gradually move up to the FOMC's 2 percent target over coming years.,2013-06-27
"Continued low or falling inflation could, however, raise real concerns.",2013-06-27
Inflation can be too low as well as too high.,2013-06-27
"I have no doubt that the Committee will monitor this carefully and defend the inflation goal ""from below,"" if necessary.",2013-06-27
Dual Mandate--Full Employment The employment side of the dual mandate is a different story.,2013-06-27
"From payroll employment's peak in January 2008 to its trough in February 2010, the U.S. economy lost nearly 9 million jobs, while the unemployment rate rose from an average of about 4â€‘1/2 percent in 2007 to a high of 10 percent in October of 2009.",2013-06-27
Unemployment was 7.6 percent in May and so has come down about 2-1/2 percentage points from its peak.,2013-06-27
"In addition, long-term unemployment remains very high--4.4 million Americans or about 37 percent of the unemployed have been out of work for six months or more.",2013-06-27
"To summarize, although inflation is below target, it is expected by most observers to return over time to the Committee's 2 percent objective.",2013-06-27
The Committee will continue to carefully monitor inflation developments.,2013-06-27
But we are still far from full employment.,2013-06-27
The case for continued support for the economy from monetary policy is strong.,2013-06-27
"Implications for Monetary Policy The federal funds rate has been near zero since late 2008, and since then the FOMC has been providing accommodation through two relatively new policy tools.",2013-06-27
"These tools are ""forward guidance"" about the future level of the federal funds rate, which is the interest rate charged on overnight loans between banks, and large-scale asset purchase programs (""asset purchases,"" or LSAPs).",2013-06-27
"The Committee indicated its intention to hold short-term rates near zero at least as long as unemployment remains above 6.5 percent, provided inflation one- to two-years ahead is projected to be no higher than 2.5 percent.4 And under the current flow-based LSAP program, adopted last year, we are purchasing $85 billion a month in long-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS).",2013-06-27
"Although the level of purchases may vary depending on economic conditions, the program will continue until there is a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, in a context of price stability.",2013-06-27
"I see the first tool, forward guidance about rates, as really an extension of traditional central bank rate-setting policy.",2013-06-27
"The Committee will continue to use interest rate policy, including forward guidance about short-term rates, as we return to full employment.",2013-06-27
"Provided inflation remains in check, the Committee will begin to assess whether to increase short-term rates when unemployment reaches 6.5 percent.",2013-06-27
"First, if inflation remains low, as expected, that would be a signal that there is still significant slack in the economy.",2013-06-27
"Second, a variety of other information will shed further light on the health of the labor market, including the labor force participation rate, flows into and out of employment, and other measures of labor slack.",2013-06-27
"After the Committee first raises short-term rates, it will take a balanced, and in all likelihood gradual, approach consistent with its longer-run goals of full employment and inflation of 2 percent.",2013-06-27
Both forward guidance and asset purchases work by lowering longer-term interest rates and contributing to an easing of overall financial market conditions.,2013-06-27
Lower rates increase economic activity through a variety of channels.5 Businesses and households react to lower rates by investing and spending more.,2013-06-27
Lower rates also support the prices of housing and financial assets such as stocks and bonds.,2013-06-27
"Higher asset prices increase wealth and, with a lag, induce higher spending.",2013-06-27
"The second round of purchases that began in November 2010 also appears to have been successful in countering disinflationary pressures.6 Now that the financial crisis has receded and the economy is recovering at a moderate pace, are asset purchases still effective?",2013-06-27
"The Fed's workhorse macro model is FRB/US, which estimates a reduction of about 20 basis points in the unemployment rate after three years in the wake of $500 billion in purchases of longer-term securities.",2013-06-27
"There are reasons to think that this estimate may be too low; for example, FRB/US does not include any direct channel for LSAPs to boost house prices.",2013-06-27
"There are also reasons to think that the estimate might be too high, since some of the channels by which lower rates spur economic activity could be attenuated in current circumstances, for example, by lower credit availability for small businesses and less creditworthy households, or corporate and household risk aversion.",2013-06-27
My view is that the LSAPs continue to provide meaningful support for economic activity but perhaps less than what the FRB/US estimates suggest.,2013-06-27
"Beyond these model-predicted effects, it also seems likely that the economy continues to benefit from the knowledge that the Federal Reserve is committed to supporting growth as long as necessary.",2013-06-27
"With inflation in check, the most important potential risk, in my view, is that of financial instability.",2013-06-27
Monetary policy has helped to keep real interest rates low.,2013-06-27
"Experience suggests that low real rates, if maintained for a long time, can lead to asset price bubbles and eventually to financial instability.",2013-06-27
"But low rates are not solely or even primarily a result of the Federal Reserve's accommodative monetary policies; they are rooted in the market's expectations of low inflation and the weakness of the economic recovery, factors weighing on rates not just in the United States but throughout the advanced economies.7 Given low real rates and low inflation, expected nominal returns should be low across all asset classes.",2013-06-27
"Whether one looks at trailing or forward price-to-earnings ratios, equity risk premiums, or option prices, there is little basis for arguing that markets show excessive optimism about future returns.",2013-06-27
"But, as my Board colleague Jeremy Stein has observed, there have been signs of a ""reach for yield"" in the fixed-income markets for some time.8 Demand for higher-yielding fixed-income securities has outstripped new supply.",2013-06-27
"The result has been very low rates, declining spreads, increasing leverage, and pressure on non-price terms such as covenants.",2013-06-27
What about house prices?,2013-06-27
"At the peak of the bubble, house prices were more than 40 percent above their usual relationship to rents, according to one model that the Fed staff follows.",2013-06-27
"At their trough, house prices had fallen about 10 percent below fair valuation.",2013-06-27
"Given the price increases over the past year, they are--by the lights of this one model--moving back into the approximate neighborhood of fair valuation.",2013-06-27
The second concern is that the process of normalizing monetary policy and the balance sheet could itself be destabilizing or disruptive to the economy.,2013-06-27
"The unemployment and inflation thresholds I discussed earlier, as well as the communication around asset purchases, are all designed to improve public understanding of the Committee's intentions.",2013-06-27
"But communications are bound to be imperfect, and changes in the outlook can still lead to adjustments in asset prices.",2013-06-27
"The Path Ahead for Monetary Policy Last week, the Chairman provided greater clarity about the path of asset purchases.",2013-06-27
"At that time, the unemployment rate would likely be in the vicinity of 7 percent, with growth consistent with further improvements and inflation heading back toward our objective.",2013-06-27
"If unemployment reaches the 7 percent range, that would constitute a substantial improvement from the 8.1 percent unemployment rate that prevailed when the Committee announced the current program of asset purchases.",2013-06-27
"When the Committee met in September, the unemployment rate stood at 8.1 percent.",2013-06-27
"Today, just nine months later, the unemployment rate is 7.6 percent--a larger decline than most FOMC participants expected in September.",2013-06-27
"At the time of the September meeting, nonfarm payrolls were reported to have increased at a monthly rate of 97,000 over the prior six months.9 Today the trailing sixâ€‘month average payroll growth is 194,000.",2013-06-27
"Other labor market indicators also show moderate progress, including aggregate hours worked, initial unemployment insurance claims, the duration of unemployment, and the share of longâ€‘term unemployment.",2013-06-27
"If economic growth, unemployment, or inflation do not meet the Committee's expectations, or if financial conditions evolve in a way that is inconsistent with continued recovery, the Committee will respond.",2013-06-27
"Congress has assigned the Federal Reserve specific responsibilities in monetary policy, financial stability, financial regulation and supervision, community and consumer affairs, and payments.",2019-11-08
Climate Change and Monetary Policy Let's start with monetary policy.,2019-11-08
"Increasingly, it will be important for the Federal Reserve to take into account the effects of climate change and associated policies in setting monetary policy to achieve our objectives of maximum employment and price stability.",2019-11-08
"Monetary policy seeks to buffer the economy from unexpected adverse disruptions, or ""shocks.""",2019-11-08
It is generally more challenging for monetary policy to insulate the economy from shocks to the supply side of the economy than to the demand side.,2019-11-08
"So it is vital for monetary policymakers to understand the nature of climate disturbances to the economy, as well as their likely persistence and breadth, in order to respond effectively.",2019-11-08
"For instance, monetary policymakers must accurately assess how disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, and flooding affect labor markets, household and business spending, output, and prices.7 In deciding whether to alter monetary policy or, instead, to ""look through"" such shocks, policymakers need to assess the likely persistence of the effects and how widespread they are.",2019-11-08
"Because there is considerable uncertainty about the persistence, breadth, and magnitude of climate-related shocks to the economy, it could be challenging to assess what adjustments to monetary policy are likely to be most effective at keeping the economy operating at potential with maximum employment and price stability.8 We need only look back to the oil price shocks of the 1970s and 1980s to see how difficult it was for monetary policymakers to assess accurately the likely persistence of the effects on inflation and output and the appropriate response.",2019-11-08
"To the extent that climate change and the associated policy responses affect productivity and long-run economic growth, there may be implications for the long-run neutral level of the real interest rate, which is a key consideration in monetary policy.",2019-11-08
"As the frequency of heat waves increases, research indicates there could be important effects on output and labor productivity.9 A shifting energy landscape, rising insurance premiums, and increasing spending on climate change adaptationsâ€”such as air conditioning and elevating homes out of floodplainsâ€”will have implications for economic activity and inflation.",2019-11-08
"As policies are implemented to mitigate climate change, they will affect prices, productivity, employment, and output in ways that could have implications for monetary policy.",2019-11-08
"Just on its own, the large amount of uncertainty regarding climate-related events and policies could hold back investment and economic activity.10 Climate Change and Financial Stability Second, the Federal Reserve will need to assess the financial system for vulnerabilities to important climate risks.",2019-11-08
"For example, if prices of properties do not accurately reflect climate-related risks, a sudden correction could result in losses to financial institutions, which could in turn reduce lending in the economy.",2019-11-08
"The associated declines in wealth could amplify the effects on economic activity, which could have further knock-on effects on financial markets.",2019-11-08

"Generally, an announcement of a change in interest rates, if any, is made at about 2:15 in the afternoon.",1999-01-15
Let me turn now to a discussion of monetary policy and the outlook for the U.S. economy.,1999-01-15
The Goals of Monetary Policy Federal law establishes the goals of monetary policy.,1999-01-15
"The Federal Reserve and the FOMC are ""to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.""",1999-01-15
"Many analysts believe that achieving price stability should be the primary goal of a central bank because a stable level of prices appears to be the condition most conducive to maximum sustained output and employment, and to moderate long-term interest rates.",1999-01-15
"This presumably is because in times of price stability the prices of goods, materials and services are undistorted by inflation and thus can serve as clearer signals and guides for the efficient allocation of resources.",1999-01-15
"Also, a background of stable prices is thought to encourage capital formation because it reduces the distortion created by a tax system that is only partly indexed for inflation.",1999-01-15
Some would argue that the remarkable period of growth that we are experiencing is due in no small measure to the low rate of inflation that has prevailed for some time.,1999-01-15
"In the long run, I have no doubt that price stability underpins efforts to achieve maximum output and employment.",1999-01-15
"But, in the short run, some tensions can arise between efforts to reduce inflation and efforts to maximize employment and output.",1999-01-15
"For example, the economy may at times be faced with adverse developments affecting supply, such as a bad agricultural harvest or a disruption in the supply of oil, which put upward pressure on prices and downward pressure on output and employment.",1999-01-15
"In these circumstances, makers of monetary policy must decide the extent to which we should focus on defusing price pressures or on cushioning the loss of output and employment in the short run, in the context of our long-term objectives.",1999-01-15
"At other times, policymakers may be concerned that expectations of inflation will get built into decisions about wages and prices, become a self-fulfilling prophecy, and result in temporary losses of output and employment.",1999-01-15
Countering this threat of inflation with a more restrictive monetary policy could risk small losses of output and employment in the short run but might make it possible to avoid larger losses later should expectations of higher inflation become embedded in the economy.,1999-01-15
"These labels are an effort to simplify, in fact, oversimplify, the complex choices that each member of the FOMC must make in deciding how to trade off the risk that action, or inaction, on our part will lead to inflation heating up to unacceptable levels, as opposed to having an inadequate creation of jobs.",1999-01-15
But I believe that all members of the Committee recognize that the major contribution the Federal Reserve can make to higher standards of living over time is to promote price stability.,1999-01-15
"It is generally thought that monetary policy takes many months to have most of its effect on growth and employment, while of course it has an immediate impact on financial markets.",1999-01-15
"Because of the long time frame for effect on the real economy, I believe that it is important for policy to look ahead one to two years as it aims at promoting stable prices and a sustainable GDP growth path, along which the economy is at full potential.",1999-01-15
"Given that we need to be forward-looking, or ""preemptive,"" as it is often put, one potentially important element in making monetary policy is the forecast or likely outlook for economic growth, unemployment and the price level for the next year or two.",1999-01-15
"Fortunately, as we make monetary policy we have the advantage of several forecasts.",1999-01-15
"To be useful for monetary policy, forecasts of the future health of the economy need to be reasonably reliable.",1999-01-15
"As one example, the failure of price inflation to pickup as labor markets have become tighter is not consistent with older empirical observations.",1999-01-15
"Moreover, factors outside of economists' models have provided some surprises, such as the Asian economic and financial turmoil and the collapse of oil prices.",1999-01-15
"In these circumstances, I believe, it is appropriate to put greater weight on incoming data to determine whether the stance of monetary policy should be changed.",1999-01-15
"Some of the variables relevant in this regard are: 1) the level of unemployment and the rate of job creation, 2) the rate of change in wages or prices or early signs of emerging inflation, 3) the rate and composition of GDP growth (inventory, trade flows, consumption, investment, residential and commercial construction, etc.",1999-01-15
"Another set of variables to be considered in making monetary policy are financial variables, such as money supply, interest rates, exchange rates, credit flows, and conditions in bank lending or in the debt and equity markets.",1999-01-15
"The last two years, 1997 and 1998, gave an interesting case study of the interplay between these different variables and the degree of forward-looking behavior in the making of monetary policy.",1999-01-15
"From March of 1997 through much of 1998, pleasant surprises in the performance of inflation and the general absence of early signs of inflation, and uncertainty about the relationship of inflation to changes in the level of production, kept the FOMC from tightening.",1999-01-15
We did not tighten despite the economy being beyond most estimates of its potential and despite many forecasts of rising inflation.,1999-01-15
"Put another way, the FOMC could have ""preemptively"" tightened monetary policy, based on forecasts, but recognizing the uncertainties about empirical relationships chose not to do so.",1999-01-15
"These concerns were centered around the fact that corporate borrowers could no longer raise funds in the bond or commercial paper markets at reasonable prices or, at some times and for some borrowers, at all.",1999-01-15
"Under those circumstances, the FOMC thought it appropriate to ease to offset a likely significant impact on future domestic spending and growth.",1999-01-15
"Finally, no discussion of monetary policy and financial markets would be complete without reference to the equity markets.",1999-01-15
"Therefore, equity prices have an influence on business fixed investment, along with consumption, the major drivers of our economy.",1999-01-15
We have seen in other economies that bubbles and busts in financial markets can create unsettled conditions that impair real economic activity.,1999-01-15
These are just some of the factors that might go into making monetary policy.,1999-01-15
"Outlook for 1999 With this general statement of the factors that go into setting monetary policy, let me turn to the outlook for 1999.",1999-01-15
It now appears to many forecasters that real GDP growth for 1998 was 3.5 percent or more on a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis.,1999-01-15
"The consensus, as represented by the most recent Blue Chip Economic Indicators, is that real growth in 1999 will moderate, perhaps to slightly over 2 percent, again on a fourth-quarter-to-fourth quarter basis (nearly 2.5 percent on a year-over-year basis).",1999-01-15
"This consensus outlook, if accurate, would eventually produce a ""soft landing"" with growth near the economy's potential and inflation remaining low.",1999-01-15
"I should also note that this is a repeat of earlier forecasts that growth will moderate, and the economy has surprised many forecasters with its resilience.",1999-01-15
"Rising stock prices continue to point to strong consumer demand, but valuations are high by historical standards and one wonders whether this stimulus will remain so strong.",1999-01-15
"At the same time, U.S. inflation has been contained, at least until recently, by a number of factors, such as a rising exchange rate for the U.S. dollar through much of last year, well-contained health care costs, and declining prices for oil and other commodities, which may prove to be short-lived.",1999-01-15
"The ability of businesses to pass on price increases has been constrained, in part, by international competition.",1999-01-15
Will the special factors I mentioned above continue to mitigate inflationary pressures arising from labor markets?,1999-01-15
"Are there other, longer-term forces at work damping price pressures that we have not yet identified?",1999-01-15
"Here in the United States, my colleague Governor Mike Kelley has stated that we are likely to see some disruptions to economic activity because of Year 2000 problems but the effects are likely to be temporary and quickly reversed.",1999-01-15
"We observe consumption, investment and labor market decisions and try to adjust monetary policy to the signals that we receive so that our nation's economic welfare is not threatened by inflation or by growth that is below the economy's potential.",1999-01-15
This morning I'd like to outline my view of current economic conditions and the economic outlook and then turn to the implications for monetary policy.,2021-10-20
"In particular, with employment still well below its February 2020 peak, I will focus on how the escalation in inflation this year is testing the monetary policy framework adopted by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in August 2020.1 Outlook for Economic Growth Recent data suggest that growth in the third quarter is likely to be lower than we had expected, but the foundations remain in place for strong economic growth over the remainder of this year and next.",2021-10-20
"Employment is growing, financial conditions are accommodative, businesses are investing, and households, in the aggregate, have a large stock of savings to draw on for future spending.",2021-10-20
"Weaker growth in payrolls in August and September, along with uneven consumer spending in July and August, appear to reflect ongoing concerns in some parts of the country about the spread of COVID-19, especially in high-contact service industries.",2021-10-20
"Supply bottlenecks and labor shortages that have been more widespread and persistent than many expected are camouflaging continued strong underlying demand for goods, services, and workers.",2021-10-20
"I expect that these developments, however, have for the most part simply postponed activity temporarily and that robust growth will return in the coming months.",2021-10-20
"The Labor Market Continues to Strengthen Without a doubt, the headline job gains in August and September were lower than expected, but, as I will show, based on almost every other major labor market indicator, there is ample evidence that the demand for labor is strong.",2021-10-20
"Another indicator I've been watching closely is the so-called U-6 unemployment rate, which consists of people who are working part time but prefer full-time work and discouraged workers who want a job but have given up looking.",2021-10-20
"U-6 unemployment declined significantly over the past two months to 8.5 percent in September, roughly the same level as in the middle of 2017, when most everyone considered the job market to be quite healthy.",2021-10-20
"Strong demand for labor is outpacing supply, and, naturally, that development is putting upward pressure on wages.",2021-10-20
"I noted the imbalance between the demand and supply for labor, and some of the labor market indicators that are still well short of pre-COVID levels are those related to labor force participation, which has been about unchanged this year on balance.",2021-10-20
"One reason is that a disproportionate number of older workers responded to the initial shock of the COVID event by retiring, which may be an area where participation and employment struggle to retrace lost ground.",2021-10-20
Longer-lasting changes in labor force participation could make wage pressures more persistent and have implications for the assessment of maximum employment.,2021-10-20
"Tapering Asset Purchases Since the middle of last year, the Fed has been increasing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities by $120 billion a month to foster smooth market functioning and to support the economy by putting downward pressure on interest rates.",2021-10-20
"Conditions had improved considerably by the time we announced our forward guidance for asset purchases in December, but the unemployment rate remained at 6.7 percent, near-term growth was being constrained by heightened social-distancing restrictions amid surging hospitalizations from COVID-19, and inflation was running significantly below 2 percent.",2021-10-20
"As we sit here today, demand for labor is strong, and unemployment has declined to 4.8 percent.",2021-10-20
"Inflation, about which I will say more shortly, is running at more than twice the FOMC's longer-run goal.",2021-10-20
"Taking all of the evidence into account, I think it is clear that we have met the test of substantial further progress toward both our employment and our inflation mandates, and I would support a decision at our November meeting to start reducing these purchases and complete that process by the middle of next year.",2021-10-20
"Bear in mind that asset purchases are pressing down on the accelerator, adding each month to the amount of accommodation the Fed is providing to the economy through downward pressure on longer-term interest rates.",2021-10-20
"Monetary Policy When the Goals Are Not Complementary A move to reduce the pace of asset purchases soon also is entirely consistent with the FOMC's plan to pursue our longer-run maximum-employment and price-stability goals, and our new monetary policy strategy, which we refer to as our framework.",2021-10-20
"Last December, with inflation running well below 2 percent and unemployment still elevated, we committed to continue purchasing assets at least at the current pace until we had made substantial further progress toward our goals.",2021-10-20
"That is, high unemployment usually coincides with subdued inflationary pressures.",2021-10-20
But we are facing a situation now where inflation is high even though employment has yet to fully recover from the COVID event.,2021-10-20
"In that case, according to the FOMC's monetary policy framework, when objectives are not complementary, the Committee ""takes into account the employment shortfalls and inflation deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate.",2021-10-20
"Early on, patience was easy: In December of last year, my FOMC colleagues and I were expecting much lower inflationâ€”the median projection for 2021 by FOMC participants was 1.8 percent.",2021-10-20
The FOMC's preferred inflation gauge did not crack 2 percent until March 2021.,2021-10-20
"But, by June, prices had risen 4 percent over the previous 12 months, ticked up to 4.2 percent in July, and increased further to 4.3 percent in August.",2021-10-20
The median of the most recent projections by FOMC participants traces a path in which inflation ends the year just a touch lower than the current level.,2021-10-20
"Nonetheless, I do not see the FOMC as behind the curve, for three reasons: Most of the biggest drivers of the very high current inflation rates will ease in coming quarters, some measures of underlying inflation pressures are less worrisome, and longer-term inflation expectations are anchored, at least for now.",2021-10-20
"First, let me address the big drivers of this year's price increases.",2021-10-20
The inflation we have experienced so far has been very unusual and largely related to supply constraints associated both with production and distribution problems related to COVID and with a demand shock arising from the unprecedented and rapid reopening of the economy.,2021-10-20
We all saw the remarkable price increases and shortages in the used car market.,2021-10-20
"There have been a few other very specific and identifiable supply problems that have driven some other prices to very high levelsâ€”the semiconductor shortages that led to auto production slowdowns, for example, and, in some cases, labor shortages or restrictions related to the COVID event were associated with trade disruptions.",2021-10-20
"Second, if we recognize that much of the excessive inflation we are seeing this year is directly attributable to disruptions that, like the COVID event, will end, then monetary policy often can look through those types of disruptions to consider what inflation will be in the future when this episode passes.",2021-10-20
"To get a fix on where inflation is headed, it is helpful to consider measures of inflation that try to filter out the most unusual and presumably transitory price increases that may be driving headline inflation.",2021-10-20
"The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas's trimmed mean measure of inflation systematically removes prices that are increasing or decreasing at abnormally large rates, in order to get some perspective on underlying inflation pressures.",2021-10-20
"For the 12 months through August, the Dallas trimmed mean inflation was an even 2 percent.",2021-10-20
"Of course, while this metric may provide a better indicator of future PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation, I do not mean to suggest that this is necessarily a better reading on current inflationâ€”consumers and businesses have to pay for the goods whose prices have risen sharply, and those increases are being felt.",2021-10-20
That brings us to the third reason that I do not think the FOMC is behind the curve: anchored inflation expectations.,2021-10-20
We monitor longer-term expectations of future inflation because we believe they influence changes in actual inflation over the medium term.,2021-10-20
"In fact, our new framework recognizes that stable, well-anchored inflation expectations help return inflation to 2 percent when it is running high, as it is now, as well as when it has fallen somewhat below that goal, as it often does during a recession.",2021-10-20
"So far, market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations, as well as surveys of professional forecasters, have increased only moderately this year, moves that more or less reversed declines in those expectations over the previous half-dozen years.",2021-10-20
"Measuring expectations is an inexact science, but smoothing through the ups and downs in expectations in recent years leaves these indicators within a range that has been consistent with inflation near our 2 percent goal.",2021-10-20
"Going forward, the question is not only whether inflation will fall in the coming months, but also how far it will fall and if it will fall soon enough to avoid spurring a concerning rise in longer-term inflation expectations.",2021-10-20
I agree with my FOMC colleagues and most private forecasters that inflation likely will decline considerably next year from its currently very elevated rate.,2021-10-20
"For instance, most of the September Summary of Economic Projections forecasts for PCE inflation in 2022 were between 1.9 and 2.3 percent, with a minimum of 1.7 percent and a maximum of 3.0 percent.3 But I see significant upside risks to my current inflation outlook.",2021-10-20
"As noted earlier, labor supply constraints are making it difficult for businesses to keep up with demand.",2021-10-20
"This dynamic will continue to support robust wage growth, putting further upward pressure on prices.",2021-10-20
"Moreover, there is evidence in the past couple of months that a broader range of prices are beginning to increase at moderate rates, and I am closely watching those developments.",2021-10-20
"The fundamental dilemma that we face at the Fed right now is this: Demand, augmented by unprecedented fiscal stimulus, has been outstripping a temporarily disrupted supply, leading to high inflation.",2021-10-20
"But the fundamental productive capacity of our economy as it existed just before COVIDâ€”and, thus, the ability to satisfy that demand without inflationâ€”remains largely as it was, and the factors that are disrupting it appear to be transitory.",2021-10-20
"Looked at purely in that light, constraining demand now, to bring it into line with a transiently interrupted supply, would be premature.",2021-10-20
"Given the lags with which monetary policy acts, we could easily find that demand is damping just as supply is increasing, leading us to undershoot our inflation targetâ€”and, in the worst case, we could depress the incentives for supply to return, leading to an extended period of sluggish activity and unnecessarily low employment.",2021-10-20
"Indeed, we are discovering that it's going to take more time than we had thought for supply to return to normal, and with demand already high during that time, I am monitoring the extent to which it could be further boosted by the additional fiscal programs currently under discussion.",2021-10-20
"If those dynamics should lead this ""transitory"" inflation to continue too long, it could affect the planning of households and businesses and unanchor their inflation expectations.",2021-10-20
This could spark a wage-price spiral that would not settle down even when the logistical bottlenecks and supply chain kinks have eased.,2021-10-20
"I am among those who see a good chance that inflation will remain above 2 percent next year, but I am not quite ready to conclude that this ""transitory"" period is already ""too long.""",2021-10-20
"Let me quote from the latest FOMC statement: Raising rates will not be appropriate ""until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.",2021-10-20
"""4 Importantly, the level of uncertainty around the paths for inflation and employment are higher than normal as we navigate the unprecedented reopening of the world economy.",2021-10-20
"Therefore, we will remain outcome based, waiting to see further improvements in employment and the evolution of inflation pressures in coming months.",2021-10-20
"And, if the broadly held expectation that inflation will recede next year turns out to be wrong or if inflation expectations show signs of becoming unanchored to the upside, I am confident that the monetary policy tools at our disposal can bring inflation down toward our 2 percent goal.",2021-10-20
"I am also keenly aware, however, that inflation of 4 percent or more certainly cannot be characterized as only ""moderately"" above 2 percent, and thus we also have to deal with the question of ""How high is too high?""",2021-10-20
"Moreover, the two questions are obviously related: we can tolerate inflation of 2.5 percent as supply returns to normal without dramatically affecting inflation expectations, for a much longer period than we can tolerate inflation of 4.5 percent.",2021-10-20
"In 2012, the FOMC formally adopted a longer-run inflation target of 2 percent, and since then, that target has been reaffirmed annually by the Committee including in our new framework adopted in August 2020.5 The key innovations in the new framework relative to the previous incarnation are designed primarily to address the risk that inflation and inflation expectations could settle below our 2 percent target.",2021-10-20
That risk emanates from the understanding that several longer-run changes in the U.S. economy may have conspired to reduce the level of the equilibrium federal funds rateâ€”the level at which it is neither slowing nor speeding up economic activity.,2021-10-20
"In turn, a lower average level of interest rates would make it more difficult, on balance, for the Federal Reserve to respond to negative shocks to the economy with sizable cuts to interest rates.",2021-10-20
The inability to cut interest rates sufficiently can then reinforce downward pressures on inflation such that it begins to run persistently below the FOMC's 2 percent goal and causes inflation expectations to fall with it.,2021-10-20
"As is well known by now, those revisions to the Fed's monetary policy framework put new emphasis on reaching maximum employment and introduced new flexibility in how to account for progress toward our price-stability goal by seeking inflation that averages 2 percent over time to ensure longer-term inflation expectations remain anchored at this level.",2021-10-20
"This revision implies that monetary policy will provide more support for economic activity over a typical business cycle than had been the case, in order to prevent longer-term inflation expectationsâ€”and, ultimately, inflation itselfâ€”from settling below 2 percent.",2021-10-20
"In this low interest rate environment, some researchers have suggested going further than our current framework does in allowing inflation to run moderately above 2 percent for some time following periods where it has run persistently lower than 2 percent, and actually raising the inflation target to 2.5 percent or 3 percent or even 4 percent.6 At the outset of our recently completed review, we reaffirmed that inflation at a rate of 2 percent is most consistent over the longer run with our congressional mandate for price stability.7 I believe that any future discussion of a higher target would need to address whether it remained consistent with that congressional mandate.",2021-10-20
"I would also emphasize that at this point, the public is very accustomed to a world of inflation near 2 percent, which has allowed households and businesses to operate with considerable certainty.",2021-10-20
"Research shows that such certainty is valuable for households and businesses to make sound financial decisions and to avoid economic distortions that could hinder economic growth.8 My strong support for our consensus framework is predicated not only upon its new features designed to address inflation that falls too low, but also its commitment to prevent longer-term inflation expectations from rising materially above a level consistent with our 2 percent goal.",2021-10-20
"In this sense, the current elevated rates of inflation are not challenging our new framework any more than they would have challenged our previous framework or, for that matter, most reasonable frameworks for conducting monetary policy.",2021-10-20
"As I said earlier, when our price-stability and employment goals are not complementary, the framework calls for policy to depend on the remaining shortfall from our maximum-employment goal, on the extent to which inflation continues to exceed 2 percent, and on the amount of time we expect it will take for employment and inflation to meet our goals.",2021-10-20
But that forecast for growth and uncertainty about the resolution of supply constraints mean that there are upside risks to inflation next year.,2021-10-20
"So my focus is beginning to turn more fully from the rapidly improving labor market to whether inflation begins its descent toward levels that are more consistent with our price-stability mandate, as most forecasters and most of my colleagues on the FOMC expect over the next year.",2021-10-20
I would also be quite wary of further increases in inflation expectations in this environment.,2021-10-20
"To set the broad demographic background, let's review the recent data on population and job growth in your region.",2005-12-05
"In contrast, the population of the rural counties in South Dakota and Minnesota increased only about 3 percent, while the population of the rural counties in North Dakota dropped almost 8 percent.1 This disparity in population growth likely reflects the better job prospects and higher level of community services available in the Sioux Falls metro area and has continued in recent years: Lincoln and Minnehaha counties grew about 9-1/2 percent between 2000 and 2004, while rural counties in South Dakota saw population declines of about 1-1/2 percent.",2005-12-05
Rates of unemployment roughly parallel these population trends.,2005-12-05
"In particular, the unemployment rates in the metropolitan areas of South Dakota have consistently been lower than in rural areas, and this relative abundance of job opportunities has tended to encourage migration to areas such as Sioux Falls.",2005-12-05
"As of late summer 2005, the rate of unemployment was 3.0 percent in Minnehaha County and 2.4 percent in Lincoln County.",2005-12-05
"In contrast, the rates of unemployment in the rural counties of South Dakota averaged about 5 percent; some of the highest county rates of unemployment reflect persistently high joblessness on Indian reservations.",2005-12-05
An important cause of the migration from rural areas to metropolitan areas has been the phenomenal growth in farm productivity in recent decades.,2005-12-05
One of the keys to the growth of Sioux Falls has been its ability to attract many of those who left the farm by providing good jobs and an attractive level of services.,2005-12-05
"Indeed, employment growth in your locale compares favorably with comparably sized metropolitan areas in the rest of the country.",2005-12-05
"Since 1990, the rate of job growth in Minnehaha and Lincoln counties has been more than twice that of other U.S. counties that include a metro area of similar size.",2005-12-05
"And compared with similarly sized metropolitan counties in other upper Great Plains states, the rate of growth in jobs in your area since 1990 has been almost 50 percent faster.",2005-12-05
"Building upon their early successes in promoting growth, your business forebears here in Sioux Falls were finding innovative ways to create more jobs, even before the great exodus from the farm to the cities after World War I.",2005-12-05
"The John Morrell enterprise also helped to create an employment anchor for the local economy, and it continues to provide jobs today.",2005-12-05
"A second economic rationale that is often advanced for the development of cities and that seems applicable to the Sioux Falls experience is that of labor market pooling--the ability of an industry to take advantage of a labor force possessing a specific set of skills, thereby raising productivity compared with competing areas with a more dispersed set of skills.",2005-12-05
"Throughout that decade, more people moved into nonmetro areas than moved out, although the population growth in metro areas still exceeded that in nonmetro areas.",2005-12-05
Lakes and oceans seem to be especially conducive to attracting population growth.,2005-12-05
"Finally, exogenous changes in economic conditions can rapidly alter the economic outlook--the recent run-ups in prices for energy and petroleum-intensive products come to mind.",2005-12-05
Experienced loan officers who are well acquainted with their markets can channel funds into the loans that are most likely to create wealth and growth in the local economy.,2005-12-05
"With regard to the Federal Reserve's role in promoting the growth of rural communities, the Fed is charged with maintaining credit conditions that are conducive to our nation's progress.",2005-12-05
"To be sure, our main tool, monetary policy, is a blunt instrument that cannot be targeted at individual industries or regions.",2005-12-05
We can best promote a progressive credit climate by maintaining an environment of low inflation.,2005-12-05
"An important reason for keeping inflation low is that entrepreneurs must be able to foresee substantial future benefits if they are to be willing to bear the long-term risks that are associated with creating new enterprises, and expected low inflation affords them a clearer view of projected benefits.",2005-12-05
"A major finding of these programs is the deleterious effects of a strategy in which metropolitan areas offer tax subsidies to compete for jobs and economic growth, a strategy that is distinctly different from those approaches that I have advocated today and that have characterized the Sioux Falls experience.",2005-12-05
Today I would like to spend a few minutes discussing the issue of transparency and responsibility in monetary policy.,1999-09-09
But we must be mindful that this new openness can have an impact on how effectively central banks pursue their primary mission -- making the best possible monetary policy.,1999-09-09
The idea is that providing more information about the Committee's views of the economic outlook may allow financial market prices to reflect more accurately the likely future stance of monetary policy.,1999-09-09
"It now announces monetary policy changes immediately after meetings, provides press releases or conferences at pre-announced times following monetary policy meetings, and has shortened considerably the lag time in releasing its meeting minutes.",1999-09-09
The press conference announcing its quarterly inflation report is also now televised.,1999-09-09
"The Bank now announces policy changes immediately after meetings, publishes minutes of the meetings, and produces two formal reports each year on monetary policy, which it explains to the Diet.",1999-09-09
"The ECB also publishes a Monthly Bulletin, which provides an assessment of monetary, financial, and economic developments, and explains monetary policy decisions of the Bank.",1999-09-09
The first is that openness may improve the effectiveness of monetary policy.,1999-09-09
"The Federal Reserve controls a very short-term interest rate -- the federal funds rate -- but it is the longer-term interest rates at which businesses and households borrow to finance spending on capital goods, homes, and durable goods which matter most for the economy.",1999-09-09
Both of these changes ought to bring the rates that matter most for the macroeconomy into closer alignment with the intentions of monetary policymakers.,1999-09-09
"Openness on the part of the central bank does not guarantee that markets will accurately forecast interest rates, however.",1999-09-09
"During this period of tightening five-year Treasury yields soared to nearly 8 percent, a rate never fully justified by the extent of firming in short-term rates, suggesting that greater openness by policymakers does not preclude the natural uncertainty involved in interest rate forecasting.",1999-09-09
"The regime targeting money growth was, in a sense, a transparent one -- the targets were contained in the biannual Humphrey Hawkins report and widely known, and money numbers were published weekly.",1999-09-09
"As the monetary aggregates became less reliable and consequently receded in importance, maintaining openness called for increased communication about the rationales for discretionary interest rate policy.",1999-09-09
"While a tighter link between monetary policy and long-term interest rates may lessen the need for the central bank to move its policy instrument as much or as quickly, it should be clear that markets are not a substitute for monetary policy action.",1999-09-09
"It is appropriate that in a democracy voters' representatives should decide the central bank's ultimate goals, as they have in the U.S., for example, by providing the Federal Reserve with a mandate to pursue stable prices, maximum employment, and moderate long-term interest rates.",1999-09-09
The main reason that central banks need to be free of political pressure in using their instruments is that effective monetary policy requires a distant time horizon.,1999-09-09
"Because changes in monetary policy generally affect output well before inflation, policymakers with nearer time horizons could be tempted to favor output in excess of capacity, at the expense of higher inflation in the future, and the well-known and inevitable disruptions that accompany it.",1999-09-09
"For example, Federal Reserve governors' terms are long and staggered, the Federal Reserve's budgets are not subject to the congressional appropriations process, and it has no obligation to purchase or support the prices of Treasury debt.",1999-09-09
"For example, while the minutes of FOMC meetings generally refer to views of ""members of the Committee,"" the Chairman represents the Committee in testimony and answers questions about the semi-annual Monetary Policy Report to Congress under the Humphrey-Hawkins law.",1999-09-09
"To the degree that policy decisions benefit from the give and take of opinions and evidence at meetings, something less than full openness to public scrutiny is required to assure the quality of monetary policymaking.",1999-09-09
"Price Stability, Inflation Targeting, and Credibility While central banks' mandated goals often include many things, price stability has emerged as the preeminent one, either formally -- as in inflation targeting countries or the Maastrict Treaty establishing the European Central Bank -- or informally, through a greater understanding of how economies work.",1999-09-09
"That is, policies that foster low inflation are more likely to deliver high employment and maximum sustainable output growth as a by-product, while policies which aim directly to keep employment and output high are more likely to result in poor inflation performance.",1999-09-09
"To paraphrase Chairman Greenspan, the economy works best when inflation is so low that businesses and households do not have to take it into account when making everyday decisions.",1999-09-09
"In the short run, however, difficult choices may be required about the timing and magnitude of policy actions consistent with achieving price stability.",1999-09-09
"One approach to such difficult choices, as I have mentioned, is to mandate a quantitative inflation target for the central bank, or to have the central bank select an inflation target that it must endeavor to achieve.",1999-09-09
"A number of other countries, like Britain, have adopted inflation targeting monetary policy regimes.",1999-09-09
"The first is what to do about supply shocks, like large increases in oil prices, which tend to increase both inflation and unemployment.",1999-09-09
"Many of the countries that have adopted inflation targeting avoid having to respond to the first-round effects of these disturbances by targeting a ""core"" price index that excludes goods like food and energy that are often subject to shocks.",1999-09-09
"However, increases in raw materials prices will still tend to pass through to higher prices for other goods, and thus raise core inflation, perhaps above the target rate or range.",1999-09-09
"In such cases, bringing inflation back down rapidly may entail high costs in terms of unusually elevated output gaps and unemployment rates.",1999-09-09
"A related issue is which other price changes, beyond those induced by supply shocks, the central bank should ignore in inflation targeting.",1999-09-09
"Some central banks use indexes that exclude certain prices, such as mortgage rates, in order to avoid the perversity of tightening policy feeding into higher measured inflation for the targeted index.",1999-09-09
"Occasionally, central banks effectively make special adjustments for other price changes, such as excise tax hikes, that clearly have an impact on ""core"" price indexes but do not signal an imbalance between demand and potential supply that might give rise to broader inflationary impulses.",1999-09-09
"Inflation-targeting regimes may allow some consideration of real-side costs either by specifying relatively long adjustment periods, to allow a high probability that the central bank can bring inflation down to the target within the allotted time, or by including ""escape clauses"" that grant temporary exemptions for large supply shocks.",1999-09-09
"The longer the policy timeframe, the less content there is to an inflation-targeting regime, and presumably the lower is its credibility.",1999-09-09
"Similarly, the more often a central bank has to declare emergencies, use escape clauses, or otherwise allow price increases to go unchecked, particularly when the rationale for such decisions is difficult to communicate to the public, the less credibility it will have.",1999-09-09
"There is a large theoretical literature on credibility in central banking, arguing for the most part that central banks need independence to be credible inflation fighters, to be able to disinflate at a lower short-run output, and social, cost.",1999-09-09
"However, the evidence does not support a particular empirical relationship between credibility and costs of disinflation, nor one between independence and costs of disinflation.",1999-09-09
"In the real world, there are two reasons why central bankers still prize credibility, even if it cannot be shown to reduce the costs of disinflation.",1999-09-09
"First, central banks need the latitude to change operating policies when circumstances warrant -- such as de-emphasizing growth rates of monetary aggregates when their velocities become unstable -- without the markets fearing that a central bank's commitment to the goal of price stability has been compromised.",1999-09-09
"For example, it was helpful in the fall of 1998 for the markets to understand that the FOMC's policy easings represented a response to a financial crisis, rather than a reduced concern about inflation.",1999-09-09
The second issue with inflation targeting is what rate or range of inflation to choose.,1999-09-09
"A rate above zero (in terms of published inflation indexes) may be appropriate, for a couple of reasons.",1999-09-09
One is that it may be difficult to conduct monetary policy at levels of inflation near zero because nominal interest rates -- including the central bank's policy rate -- cannot be below zero.,1999-09-09
"Many observers believe that monetary policy in Japan is constrained in this way, with its current policy setting an essentially zero short-term interest rate.",1999-09-09
"A second reason is the statistical biases in inflation indexes, resulting from slow inclusion of new goods, improvements in quality, substitution from more expensive to cheaper goods, and other factors.",1999-09-09
"In the United States, the 1996 Boskin Commission report, estimated that these biases may have overstated true inflation in the consumer price index at that time by three-quarters to one-and-one-half percentage points per year.",1999-09-09
"In such an environment, a central bank mandated to pursue price stability can be flexible according to the circumstances, while one with a numerical target may need to obtain formal modification of its objectives.",1999-09-09
"In my contribution to the discussion today, I want to examine a particular example of the lasting effect that Hayek has had on economic thinkingâ€”one pertaining to the importance of freely determined prices for producing efficient economic outcomesâ€”and consider how Hayek's insights in this area can, in fact, tie together the various strands of his larger philosophy.",2019-11-01
"His work in this area included the theory of the business cycle that was part of the thinking of the Austrian school of economics.4 It also included Hayek's studies of the feasibility and implications of private-sector currency issuanceâ€”contributions that have informed modern-day analyses of the repercussions of electronic money.5 Today, however, I will be concerned instead with still another key contribution that Hayek made to economic analysis: understanding the operation of the price system.",2019-11-01
His conclusion is that only by far-reaching decentralization in a market system with competition and free price-fixing is it possible to make full use of knowledge and information.,2019-11-01
"Williamson cited Hayek's 1945 paper, along with Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations from the eighteenth century, as forming the core of a ""venerated tradition in economics"" of studying the notion of ""spontaneous order"" arising from a freely operating market system.9 How does Hayek's case for the price system fit in alongside the other work that Williamson mentioned?",2019-11-01
"As Paul Samuelsonâ€”yet another Nobel Prize winnerâ€”had occasion to note, the argument for the price system that Hayek articulated in 1945 was complementary with, but distinct from, the argument that Adam Smith espoused in The Wealth of Nations.10 Smith focused on how market mechanisms guide producers toward satisfying consumers' wants.",2019-11-01
"Hayek instead stressed how the market mechanism makes, as he put it, ""fuller use...of the existing knowledge"" than a directed economy is able to do.11 Hayek emphasized that the signals transmitted by the various individual prices in the economy could, together, serve as a useful means of guiding overall resource allocation.",2019-11-01
"The reason is that prices convey messages to consumers and producers even when the information that drives prices is not aggregated or directly observed.12 For example, a large increase or decrease in the price of gasoline conveys information that influences consumer behavior and that also affects the behavior of energy producers, even when neither of these sets of market participants are aware of the precise factor initiating the price change.",2019-11-01
"As a related matter, Hayek recognized that prices transmit information even in a situation in which much of that information is not explicitly disclosed by one market participant to another, or even consciously articulable by any market participant at all.",2019-11-01
"Hayek believed that all of us ""know"" many things that we cannot articulate but that we nevertheless act on in practical situations, and the price system can therefore aggregate and transmit that knowledge which we could not otherwise convey.",2019-11-01
"To Hayek, it was totally unrealistic to expect an economy to operate efficiently if it was based on the ""direction of the whole economic system according to one unified plan,"" as such a plan lacked the valuable information embedded in market-determined prices.13 The economist Gregory Mankiw has elegantly summed up Hayek's insight here: ""Information is very, very dispersed among the population.",2019-11-01
"The flip side of Hayek's analysis was that, while there are insurmountable obstacles to economic efficiency via a central plan, an efficient economy may still be obtainable by letting the price system work.",2019-11-01
"It is, instead, sufficient for the proper operation of the price mechanism that the relevant information be embodied implicitly in the economy's multiplicity of prices of individual goods and factors of production.",2019-11-01
"This information is recorded in such prices because they respond to the behavior of individual buyers and sellers in the economy.16 Consequently, as longtime Hayek scholar Gerald O'Driscoll has observed: ""What particularly recommends the price system to Hayek is the 'economy of knowledge' with which it operates.",2019-11-01
"For example, Hayek's analysis has proved valuable in the development of standard microeconomics, since his contribution deepened economists' understanding of the working of the price system and promoted further investigation of the question of how decentralized information is transmitted by markets.18 Hayek's emphasis on prices as processors of information has also had applications to international trade theory.19 And in macroeconomics and monetary theory, Milton Friedman's Nobel lecture, published in 1977, cited Hayek's 1945 paper when arguing that, because it disrupted the signals arising from relative-price movements, inflation both lowered the efficiency of the economy and led output to deviate from its natural (or full-employment) level.20 Hayek likened the price mechanism to a ""system of telecommunications,"" and Friedman's description of inflation as a form of ""static"" interrupting price signals was in keeping with this analogy.21 Hayek's ideas on prices influenced Joseph Stiglitz in his analysis of markets with asymmetric information and Roger Myerson's insights on mechanism design theory.",2019-11-01
"On the contrary, one of the reasons why the paper has been so influential is that it remains a benchmark reference for understanding the case for relying primarily on a market system, based on freely determined prices, for determining the production and allocation of resources.",2019-11-01
"The paper has therefore set a high bar for preempting the price system or for other interventions in the market: When economists point to cases in which market mechanisms can be improved on by regulation or other public-sector intervention, or to instances in which price signals do not appear to be operating effectively, they need to identify a specific market failure as the source of the inefficiency.",2019-11-01
"Essentially, they need to establish instances in which the price system can be improved on as a means of processing information.23 Even Hayek acknowledged that the price mechanism works within an ecosystem of laws and social institutions, and those may evolve in ways that interfere with the signaling of prices.",2019-11-01
"Spreads on risky private-sector debt reached very low levels, and damaging spillovers to the nonfinancial sector occurred in the form of unduly high real estate prices and excessive leverage by borrowers in the housing market.",2019-11-01
"By creating appropriate incentives and rules, they should also encourage financial markets to price risk more appropriately than they did in the years leading up to the crisisâ€”for example, by reducing the danger of investor complacency regarding the riskiness of their investments and the possibility of adverse scenarios.",2019-11-01
"If we follow Hayek and regard the price system as like a telecommunications network, and then apply that metaphor to the financial sector, we can think of the institutional and regulatory changes to the financial system over the past decade as designed to improve the reliability and signal quality of the transmissions.25 How does all of this relate to the larger questions of philosophy and social order to which Hayek devoted much of his thought?",2019-11-01
Hayek's insights about the price system depend importantly on his theory of knowledge: The information that is available to us as a society is the aggregate of the highly dispersed and sometimes inarticulate knowledge possessed by each of us individually.,2019-11-01
"Thus, even if some technological way to aggregate information other than through prices could be invented, it would lead to less efficient, less humane outcomes because it would be based on less total human information.",2019-11-01
"The price mechanism, then, is not just a matter of economicsâ€”it is a matter of social and, indeed, civilizational progress.",2019-11-01
Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Now I would like to turn to the current economic scene and this week's FOMC decision.,2019-11-01
"Economic conditions are currently very close to meeting ourâ€”that is, the FOMC'sâ€”dual-mandate objectives of maximum sustainable employment and price stability.",2019-11-01
"The unemployment rate has been running near a 50-year low, and the proportion of the population currently employed is close to its highest level in a decade.",2019-11-01
"Although the pace of job gains has slowed this year, we expected some deceleration because of how low the unemployment rate has fallen.",2019-11-01
A strong job market and high employment have in turn supported economic growth.,2019-11-01
"Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) grew 2-1/2 percent over the past four quarters, a healthy pace by historical standards and a major contributor to overall growth since consumption represents over two-thirds of economic activity.",2019-11-01
"Because the labor market remains tight, I expect wage growth to pick up, which would then in turn underpin further strength in consumption and overall growth.",2019-11-01
"For the other half of our mandate, inflation as measured by the PCE index was 1.3 percent over the 12 months ending in September, while core PCE inflation, which excludes increases in the prices of food and energy, was 1.7 percent.",2019-11-01
"While these readings are below our 2 percent inflation objective, they are fairly close, and my assessment is that inflation will inch toward our objective in the coming months.",2019-11-01
I am heartened by a recent pickup in labor productivity growth.,2019-11-01
A notable development of the post-crisis period has been the abysmal pace of labor productivity growth.,2019-11-01
"After averaging about a 2-1/4 percent pace in the two decades leading up to the crisis, labor productivity growth has been closer to 1 percent, on average, since 2011.",2019-11-01
"Although the quarterly data are volatile, I have been encouraged by a pickup in labor productivity in the first half of this year, when it grew at a 3 percent annual rate.",2019-11-01
"Further out, I admit to being a bit of techno-enthusiast, and I see the potential for many emerging technologies, including 5G communications, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and 3-D printing, to further boost productivity growth in the coming years.",2019-11-01
"Having established my optimism, I will now circle back to some more worrying signs in the recent data that suggest some headwinds are holding back growth.",2019-11-01
One prominent factor weighing on a relatively robust domestic economy has been weak growth among our trading partners.,2019-11-01
The International Monetary Fund projects that global economic growth in 2019 will be the slowest since the financial crisis.,2019-11-01
"Partly as a consequence of weak foreign growth, U.S. exports have been flat over the past year.",2019-11-01
"It is likely that some of the weakness in capital spending is a result of elevated uncertainty, for foreign growth generally but also specifically for trade developments.",2019-11-01
Achieving and maintaining price stability is the bedrock principle of a sound monetary policy.,2003-07-23
"Price stability promotes economic growth and welfare by increasing the efficiency of the market mechanism, facilitating long-term planning, and minimizing distortions created by the interaction of inflation and the tax code, accounting rules, financial contracts, and the like.",2003-07-23
Price stability also increases economic welfare by promoting stability in output and employment.,2003-07-23
"In particular, the marked decline in the variability of both inflation and output in recent decades, not only in the United States but also in most of the rest of the world, is by no means an accident.",2003-07-23
A significant portion of this improved performance has resulted from a reorientation of central bank policies toward a greater emphasis on keeping inflation low and stable.,2003-07-23
"These policies have helped to anchor the public's inflation expectations at a low level, which has not only helped to contain inflation but has also given central banks greater latitude to stabilize the real economy with less concern than in the past about potential inflationary consequences.",2003-07-23
"Since the inflation crisis of the 1970s, the Federal Reserve has consistently pursued the goal of price stability in the United States.",2003-07-23
"Core inflation measures (that is, measures of inflation that exclude the prices of the relatively volatile food and energy components) now lie in the general range of 1 to 2 percent per year, which (taking into account factors such as measurement biases in inflation indexes) is probably the de facto equivalent of price stability.",2003-07-23
"Attaining price stability is an important accomplishment, one of which my predecessors on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) can justifiably be proud.",2003-07-23
But this development has also forced the Federal Reserve--as well as the public--to reorient its thinking about inflation in a fundamental way.,2003-07-23
"After a long period in which the desired direction for inflation was always downward, we are now in a situation in which risks to the inflation rate can be either upward, toward excessive inflation, or downward, toward too-low inflation or deflation.",2003-07-23
"That statement was the first to assess the risks to economic activity and inflation separately, recognizing explicitly that upside and downside risks to inflation could exist under varying conditions of the real economy.",2003-07-23
"Previous FOMC statements had characterized the balance of risks one-dimensionally, as being either in the direction of economic weakness or in the direction of excessive inflation.",2003-07-23
The May 6 statement was more than a procedural innovation; it also broke new ground as the first occasion in which the FOMC expressed the concern that inflation might actually fall too low.,2003-07-23
"Let me repeat the critical portion of the statement for you: ""Although the timing and extent of [the] improvement remain uncertain, the Committee perceives that over the next few quarters the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth are roughly equal.",2003-07-23
"In contrast, over the same period, the probability of an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation, though minor, exceeds that of a pickup in inflation from its already low level.",2003-07-23
"Today I would like to share my own thoughts on the prospect of an ""unwelcome substantial fall in inflation""--in particular, why a substantial fall in inflation going forward would indeed be unwelcome; why some risk of further disinflation, though ""minor,"" should not be ignored; and what such a fall would imply for the conduct of monetary policy.",2003-07-23
"Obviously, the opinions I will express are strictly my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee or the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.1 Why a Fall in Inflation Would Be Unwelcome After a decades-long war on inflation--dubbed ""public enemy number one"" in some public opinion polls in the 1970s--imagining that a ""substantial fall in inflation"" would be unwelcome seems just a bit strange.",2003-07-23
"First, we have no reason to think that a drastic change in the inflation rate is imminent.",2003-07-23
"Second, nowhere did the statement refer specifically to deflation (that is, to a decline in the general price level); rather, the reference was, again, to a ""substantial fall in inflation.""",2003-07-23
"In the present circumstances, a disinflation (a decline in the rate of inflation) and a deflation (a falling price level) are not necessarily the same thing.",2003-07-23
"Inflation could decline somewhat from present levels and still remain positive, although it is true that the lower the inflation rate goes, the greater is the risk of actual deflation at some future time.",2003-07-23
This distinction between inflation that is positive yet too low and deflation is worth exploring for a moment.,2003-07-23
"Although the Federal Reserve does not have an explicit numerical target range for measured inflation, FOMC behavior and rhetoric have suggested to many observers that the Committee does have an implicit preferred range for inflation.",2003-07-23
"Most relevant here, the bottom of that preferred range clearly seems to be a value greater than zero measured inflation, at least 1 percent per year or so.",2003-07-23
"Both the apparent tendency of measured inflation to overstate the true rate of price increase, as suggested by a range of studies, and the need to provide some buffer against accidental deflation serve as rationales for aiming for positive (as opposed to zero) measured inflation, both in the short run and in the long run.",2003-07-23
"To the extent that one accepts the view that measured inflation should be kept some distance above zero, a very low positive measured rate of inflation (say, 1/2 percent to 1 percent per year) is undesirable and implies a need for highly accommodative monetary policy, just as would be required for outright deflation.",2003-07-23
The language of the May 6 statement encompasses the risks of both very low inflation and deflation.,2003-07-23
"I suspect that for the foreseeable future, of the two, the risk of very low but positive inflation is considerably the greater.",2003-07-23
"That is, inflation in the range of 1/2 percent per year in the United States in the next couple of years, though relatively unlikely, is considerably more likely than deflation of 1/2 percent per year.",2003-07-23
"Having drawn a distinction between very low inflation and deflation, however, I must also point out that, in terms of their costs to the economy, no sharp discontinuity exists at the point that measured inflation changes from positive to negative values.",2003-07-23
"Very low inflation and deflation pose qualitatively similar economic problems, though the magnitude of the associated costs can be expected to increase sharply as deflationary pressures intensify.",2003-07-23
"In practice, the potential harm of very low inflation or deflation depends importantly on the economic environment in which it occurs.",2003-07-23
"Under such circumstances, deflation or unexpectedly low inflation, by increasing the real burden of debts, may exacerbate financial distress and cause further deterioration in the functioning of the financial markets.",2003-07-23
"For example, households have taken advantage of low interest rates to refinance their mortgages, in the process both lowering their monthly house payments and using accumulated equity to pay off more expensive forms of consumer debt, such as credit card debt.",2003-07-23
A second set of circumstances in which deflation or very low inflation may pose significant problems is potentially more relevant to the current U.S. economy.,2003-07-23
"That situation is one in which aggregate demand is insufficient to sustain strong growth, even when the short-term real interest rate is zero or negative.",2003-07-23
Deflation (or very low inflation) poses a potential problem when aggregate demand is insufficient because deflation places a lower limit on the real short-term interest rate that can be engineered by monetary policymakers.,2003-07-23
This limit is a consequence of the well-known zero-lower-bound constraint on nominal interest rates.,2003-07-23
"For example, if prices are falling at a rate of 1 percent per year, the short-term real interest rate cannot be reduced below 1 percent, since doing so would require setting the nominal interest rate below zero, which is impossible.",2003-07-23
"(Likewise, the very low inflation rate of 1/2 percent would prevent setting the real interest rate lower than minus 1/2 percent.)",2003-07-23
"Thus, in a situation of insufficient aggregate demand, deflation or very low inflation might prevent the Fed from achieving full employment, at least by means of the Fed's traditional policy tool of changing the short-term nominal interest rate.2 In the worst-case scenario, one might worry that the interaction of deflation, the short-term nominal interest rate, and aggregate demand could conceivably touch off a destabilizing dynamic.",2003-07-23
Suppose that initially short-term nominal interest rates were already near zero and prices were falling.,2003-07-23
"If aggregate demand was sufficiently low relative to potential supply, deflation might grow worse, as economic slack led to more aggressive wage- and price-cutting.",2003-07-23
"Because the short-term nominal interest rate cannot be reduced further, worsening deflation would raise the real short-term interest rate, effectively tightening monetary policy.",2003-07-23
"The higher real interest rate might further reduce aggregate demand, exacerbating the deflation and continuing the downward spiral.",2003-07-23
"Fortunately, in practice, even if the Fed's ability to influence aggregate demand was weakened by the interaction of worsening deflation and the zero-bound constraint on nominal interest rates, other factors could serve to short-circuit any incipient downward spiral.",2003-07-23
"First, even in the presence of deflation, aggregate demand can be raised by fiscal actions.",2003-07-23
"Third, if inflation expectations remain well anchored, the real return expected by borrowers and lenders--equal to the nominal interest rate less expected inflation--need not rise even as inflation declines.",2003-07-23
"Finally, as I have discussed in earlier talks and will allude to again today, the Fed's tools for managing aggregate demand are not limited to control over the short-term nominal interest rate, but include other channels as well.",2003-07-23
"In any case, I hope we can agree that a substantial fall in inflation at this stage has the potential to interfere with the ongoing U.S. recovery, and that in conceivable--though remote--circumstances, a serious deflation could do significant economic harm.",2003-07-23
"Thus, avoiding a further substantial fall in inflation should be a priority of monetary policy.",2003-07-23
"To my mind, the central import of the May 6 statement is that the Fed stands ready and able to resist further declines in inflation; and--if inflation does fall further--to ensure that the decline does not impede the recovery in output and employment.",2003-07-23
A Further Fall in Inflation: What is the Likelihood?,2003-07-23
"What, then, is the likelihood of a further, possibly substantial fall in inflation?",2003-07-23
"And, in particular, why worry about further disinflation when financial markets and forecasters seem moderately optimistic about economic recovery in the United States?",2003-07-23
"As a starting point, we should note that underlying inflation has declined noticeably in the past year or so.",2003-07-23
"Let me cite a few numbers, focusing on core inflation measures, which I remind you are defined to exclude the relatively more volatile food and energy prices.",2003-07-23
"According to numbers just released, inflation as measured by the core consumer price index, or CPI, was 1.5 percent in the year ending June 2003, compared with 2.3 percent in the year ending June 2002, a deceleration of 0.8 percentage points over the year.",2003-07-23
"Inflation as measured by the core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index, a so-called chain-weight index that has the advantage of allowing for shifting expenditure weights, also fell, though less dramatically, from 1.7 percent in the year ending May 2002 to 1.2 percent in the year ending May 2003 (June data are not yet available), a fall of 0.5 percentage points.3 These inflation rates, though declining (and they have declined a bit more in the past six months), remain generally above the 1 percent ""buffer zone,"" and it is always possible that their recent declines will prove to be short-lived.",2003-07-23
Where is inflation likely to go over the foreseeable future?,2003-07-23
Medium-term inflation forecasting is highly contentious--not least because the underlying theory of the determination of inflation continues to divide macroeconomic schools of thought--and I cannot begin to do justice to the topic in a short talk.,2003-07-23
"According to this class of models, inflation in the intermediate term is affected primarily by four factors: Economic slack.",2003-07-23
"If aggregate demand is below potential output, implying a positive output gap, the rate of increase in labor compensation and other input costs should slow, firms should be less able to pass price increases, and thus inflation should slow.",2003-07-23
Inflation expectations.,2003-07-23
"All else being equal, higher expected rates of inflation will intensify pressure for increases in wages and other costs and thus raise actual inflation.",2003-07-23
The objectives and performance of monetary policymakers over the long run are key determinants of these expectations.,2003-07-23
"Supply shocks, such as changes in energy prices, food prices, or import prices.",2003-07-23
"Some supply shocks, such as shocks to import prices other than those of food and energy, affect core inflation directly.",2003-07-23
"Shocks to the prices of energy or food may affect core inflation if they become embodied in inflation expectations or if they boost core prices indirectly by raising the costs of inputs in the production of non-energy, non-food goods and services.",2003-07-23
Inflation persistence.,2003-07-23
"Many economists have argued that inflation tends to be persistent, or ""sticky,"" perhaps for institutional reasons related to the process of wage determination, supply contracts, and the like.",2003-07-23
"Hence, current trends in inflation can be expected to persist.",2003-07-23
"Of course, this model, like any model, will have an error term, which represents a portion of the behavior of inflation that we can't reliably explain or predict.",2003-07-23
"Historically, the error terms of estimated inflation models have tended to be large relative to the overall variability of inflation, implying that inflation is more difficult to forecast than we would like.",2003-07-23
"This difficulty of forecasting inflation has important implications, as we shall see.",2003-07-23
You may have noted that I did not include money growth in this list of inflation determinants.,2003-07-23
"Ultimately, inflation is a monetary phenomenon, as suggested by Milton Friedman's famous dictum.",2003-07-23
"However, no contradiction exists, as the expectational Phillips curve is fully consistent with inflation's being determined by monetary forces in the long run.",2003-07-23
"I only note that, as an empirical matter, instabilities in money demand, financial innovation, and many special factors affecting the monetary aggregates make them relatively poor predictors of inflation at medium-term horizons.",2003-07-23
"Within this framework for thinking about price dynamics, the factor most likely to exert downward pressure on the future course of inflation in the United States is the degree of economic slack that is currently prevailing and will likely continue for some time yet.",2003-07-23
"By conventional analyses, therefore, even if the pace of real activity picks up considerably this year and next, persistent slack might result in continuing disinflation.5 A highly simplified, though not quantitatively unreasonable, calculation may help.",2003-07-23
"Let us suppose that economic activity does pick up in the second half of this year, by enough to bring real GDP growth in line with its long-run potential growth rate--roughly 3 percent or so, by conventional estimates.",2003-07-23
"Moreover, suppose that activity strengthens further next year so, so that real GDP growth climbs to approximately 4 percent, a full percentage point above potential.",2003-07-23
What will happen to resource utilization and inflation?,2003-07-23
"Given the average historical relationship between the change in the output gap and labor market conditions, known as Okun's Law, the unemployment rate would be expected to remain at about its current level of 6.4 percent through the end of the year and then decline gradually to about 6.0 percent by the end of next year.",2003-07-23
Let us turn now to the implications for inflation.,2003-07-23
"From 1994 to 2002, core PCE inflation remained in a stable range while the unemployment rate averaged about 5 percent; so let us suppose, for purposes of this example, that the unemployment rate at which inflation is stable is 5 percent.",2003-07-23
"(If the unemployment rate at which inflation is stable is lower than 5 percent, the disinflation problem I am discussing becomes larger.)",2003-07-23
A little arithmetic shows that this scenario involves 1.9 point-years of extra unemployment (relative to the full-employment benchmark) between now and the end of 2004.,2003-07-23
"Now make the additional assumption that the sacrifice ratio (the point-years of unemployment required to reduce inflation by 1 point) is 4.0, a high value by historical standards but one in the range of many current estimates.",2003-07-23
"Then the additional disinflation between now and the end of next year should be about 1.9 divided by 4, or about 0.5 percentage points.",2003-07-23
"So given our assumptions about GDP growth, core PCE inflation, say, might fall from 1.2 percent currently to 0.7 percent or so by the end of 2004.",2003-07-23
"But the bottom line (which would not be much affected if we played around with the numbers) is that, even if the economy recovers smartly for the rest of this year and next, the ongoing slack in the economy may still lead to continuing disinflation.",2003-07-23
"So the FOMC's May 6 statement, by indicating both balanced risks to economic growth (that is, a reasonable chance of a good recovery) and a downward risk to inflation, had no internal inconsistency.",2003-07-23
"Now, further disinflation of half a percentage point in conjunction with a significant strengthening of the real economy would not pose a significant problem.",2003-07-23
"If the recovery is significantly weaker than we hope, for example, the greater level and persistence of economic slack could intensify disinflationary pressures at an inopportune time.",2003-07-23
"Another possibility, given the uncertainty inherent in measures of potential output, is that the amount of effective slack currently in the economy is greater than most analysts think--which, if true, would help to explain the recent pace of disinflation.",2003-07-23
"For example, during the late 1990s, economists worked hard to explain the combination of an unusually low unemployment rate and stable inflation--possible evidence of a decline in the economy's sustainable unemployment rate.",2003-07-23
"Factors that were thought to have contributed to a lower sustainable rate of unemployment included the maturation of the labor force (Shimer, 1998); increased numbers of people on disability insurance (Autor and Duggan, 2002) and increased rates of incarceration (Katz and Krueger, 1999), both of which tended to remove less employable individuals from the labor force; improved matching between workers and jobs, facilitated by increased access to the Internet and the rise of temporary help agencies (Katz and Krueger, 1999); and perhaps other factors as well.",2003-07-23
"Many of these forces continue to operate in today's economy, conceivably with greater force than in the late 1990s.6 In addition, measured labor productivity has continued to increase rapidly since early 2001--remarkably so, considering that productivity tends to be strongly procyclical--raising the possibility that we have underestimated the degree to which innovation and better use of existing resources have increased potential output.",2003-07-23
"If so, the true level of slack in the economy is higher than conventional estimates suggest, implying that incipient disinflationary pressures may be more intense.",2003-07-23
"Of the various elements that make up the expectations-augmented Phillips curve, the degree of economic slack is the one currently providing the greatest impetus for further disinflation.",2003-07-23
"By contrast, other elements of this conventional framework offer somewhat more reason to hope that inflation will instead stabilize at current levels or fall only slightly.",2003-07-23
"In particular, as best we can tell, the public's inflation expectations have not declined very much, particularly at longer horizons.",2003-07-23
"For example, according to the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center, the median respondent's expectation of inflation over the next twelve months fell from 2.5 percent in January 2003 to 2.1 percent in June; however, the median expectation for inflation for the next five to ten years was 2.7 percent in both January and June.7 Inflation compensation at the five-year horizon as measured by indexed government bonds has cycled up and down recently but has averaged about 1.5 percent since early 2001.",2003-07-23
Interpretation of all these measures of expected inflation is made more difficult by the fact that they are defined for total (as opposed to core) CPI inflation and hence presumably are affected by fluctuations in energy prices.,2003-07-23
"Nevertheless, the evidence thus far does not support the view that there has been a significant break in medium-term inflation expectations.",2003-07-23
"For a various reasons, including the limited pass-through of price increases by foreign producers and uncertainties about the future course of the dollar, the dollar's fall is likely to have only a modest effect on the inflation rate; but any effect it has should work against further disinflation.",2003-07-23
"Overall, the stabilizing effects of well-anchored inflation expectations and the slightly inflationary effect of the dollar depreciation are two reasons to expect whatever disinflation takes place to be reasonably gradual.",2003-07-23
One more element of the model for inflation is important to mention: the error term.,2003-07-23
"At the upcoming August meeting, the Board staff, as it always does, will present the FOMC with its forecasts for inflation.",2003-07-23
"Based on historical experience (using actual staff forecasts for 1985-97), the staff's forecast for CPI inflation for the full year 2003 (that is, the current year) will prove fairly accurate; the confidence interval for that forecast, as measured by the root mean squared error, will be only 0.3 percentage points.",2003-07-23
"However, if history is a guide, the forecast the staff provides next month for CPI inflation during 2004 will have a confidence interval of about 1.0 percentage points, a fairly wide range.",2003-07-23
This amount of uncertainty is no reason to be defeatist about trying to forecast inflation but it is a reason to be cautious.,2003-07-23
We are currently in a range where undershooting our inflation objective by 1 percentage point is more costly than overshooting by 1 percentage point.,2003-07-23
"All else being equal, that fact should put us on our guard against unwanted further declines in inflation.",2003-07-23
"Implications for Monetary Policy In summary, there appears to be some possibility that the recent trend toward disinflation will continue, primarily because of the potentially large amount of economic slack in the system.",2003-07-23
Stable expectations of inflation and the recent weakening of the dollar may help to offset that tendency.,2003-07-23
"In any case, we must keep in mind that the uncertainty regarding our forecasts of inflation is significant.",2003-07-23
What are the implications for monetary policy of these observations?,2003-07-23
"First, as the May 6 statement made clear, for the foreseeable future the risk of further declines in inflation from an already low level outweighs the risk of a resurgence of inflation.",2003-07-23
"Of course, an extended period of ease dovetails well with the FOMC's objective of supporting a strong and self-sustaining recovery in output and employment.",2003-07-23
"Should the funds rate approach zero, the question will arise again about so-called nontraditional monetary policy measures.",2003-07-23
"Without going into great detail, I see the first stages of a ""nontraditional"" campaign as focused on lowering longer-term interest rates.",2003-07-23
Let me end the talk by discussing the role of such statements in both traditional and nontraditional monetary policy.,2003-07-23
"A crucial element of the statement was an implicit commitment about future monetary policy; namely, a strong indication that, so long as a substantial fall in inflation remains a risk, monetary policy will maintain an easy stance.",2003-07-23
"Particularly at very low inflation rates, a central bank's ability to make clear and credible commitments about future policy actions--broadly, how it plans to adjust the short-term interest rate as economic conditions change--is crucial for influencing longer-term interest rates and other asset prices, which are themselves key transmission channels of monetary policy (Eggertsson and Woodford, 2003).",2003-07-23
"In my view--and here I am quite obviously speaking for myself--one useful approach would be for the FOMC to provide the public with a quantitative, working definition of price stability.",2003-07-23
"The definition of price stability would be expressed as a range of measured inflation, with the lower boundary of the range a safe distance from zero.8 What I have in mind here is not a formal inflation target but rather a tool for aiding communication.",2003-07-23
The main purpose of this quantification of price stability would be to provide some guidance to the public and to financial markets as they try to forecast FOMC behavior.,2003-07-23
"In a situation like the current one, with inflation presumably near the bottom of the acceptable range and trending down, and with considerable slack remaining in the real economy, the Fed could make use of this quantitative guidepost to signal its expectation that rates will be kept low for a protracted period, and indeed that they would be reduced further if disinflation were not contained.",2003-07-23
"If private-sector forecasts also called for disinflation, confirming the downward risk to price stability, then medium-term bond yields should accordingly be low, supporting the Fed's reflationary efforts.",2003-07-23
"In principle, one could communicate a similar message, though perhaps less precisely, without a quantitative measure of price stability.",2003-07-23
"At some point in the future, if all goes well, inflation will stabilize, and interest rates will begin to rise.",2003-07-23
A quantitative measure of price stability provides one objective basis that bond market participants could use to help forecast the change in policy stance.,2003-07-23
"For example, they would know that as disinflation risk recedes and inflation forecasts begin to cluster in the middle to upper portions of the price stability range, the Fed is quite likely to react.",2003-07-23
"And, indeed, the forecasts of bond market participants and the resulting rise in private yields will help to contain inflation, doing some of the Fed's work for it.",2003-07-23
"In a world in which inflation risks are no longer one-sided and short-term nominal interest rates are at historical lows, the success of monetary policy depends more on how well the central bank communicates its plans and objectives than on any other single factor.",2003-07-23
"Even when the zero bound is not binding, a fall in the rate of inflation raises real interest rates, thereby eroding the effects of any previous monetary easing.",2003-07-23
Part of the reason that core PCE inflation fell less than CPI inflation is that the PCE index includes so-called nonmarket prices--prices that are imputed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis because reliable market data are not available--and nonmarket prices have been trending upward lately.,2003-07-23
"Indeed, the market-based portion of core PCE inflation for the year ending in May was only 0.7 percent.",2003-07-23
"The success of the Board staff in forecasting inflation is well documented (Romer and Romer, 2000; Sims, 2002).",2003-07-23
"Much of this success comes from intensive data analysis (including computing projections of many components of the important price indexes, using a wide variety of data and anecdotal information) that leads to highly accurate short-term inflation forecasting.",2003-07-23
"Since inflation tends to be inertial, ""getting the initial conditions right"" is important for medium-term forecasting success (Sims, 2002).",2003-07-23
"Another important element of successful inflation forecasting, at the Board and elsewhere, is the use of a wide range of information in forming the forecast.",2003-07-23
"Cecchetti, Chu, and Steindel (2000) show that single indicators, such as unemployment or the money supply, are unlikely to be reliable forecasters of inflation.",2003-07-23
"The Chicago Fed National Activity Index, an index of eighty-five economic indicators, is based on the Stock-Watson work and has been used to forecast both inflation and economic activity (Fisher, 2000; Evans, Liu, and Pham-Kanter, 2002).",2003-07-23
Atkeson and Ohanian (2001) criticized the idea that measures of economic slack are useful for forecasting inflation.,2003-07-23
"They showed that, for the sample period 1984-99, three statistical models that included measures of slack were no better on average at predicting inflation than the ""naïve"" alternative of guessing that inflation next year would be the same as inflation this year.",2003-07-23
They make a similar finding when comparing the naïve forecast to Board staff inflation forecasts (which incorporate an economic slack concept).,2003-07-23
"Extending their sample period to include additional recessions (or, for that matter, using alternative measures of inflation) tends to overturn their main results (see, for example, Sims, 2002).",2003-07-23
"Some economists argued that the tendency of real wages to lag behind the unexpectedly strong productivity gains of the 1990s also reduced sustainable unemployment during that period (Ball and Moffitt, 2001; see also Braun, 1984).",2003-07-23
"To the extent this argument was valid, presumably this factor is less relevant today, because productivity growth has moderated somewhat and has probably become more fully incorporated into the wage determination process.",2003-07-23
Preliminary July figures show a drop in the 12-month median inflation expectation to 1.7 percent.,2003-07-23
However the long-term inflation expectation edged up in July to 2.8 percent.,2003-07-23
"This ongoing intellectual exchange, by improving our understanding of the economy and the workings of monetary policy, has had and will continue to have sizable benefits.",2007-07-10
"Today I will offer a few remarks on the relationships among monetary policy, inflation, and the public's expectations of inflation, focusing--as seems appropriate for this audience--on some important open questions.",2007-07-10
"I will also give a short overview of the way the Federal Reserve Board staff forecasts inflation, including some discussion of how the staff incorporates information about expected inflation into its forecasting process.",2007-07-10
"As you know, the control of inflation is central to good monetary policy.",2007-07-10
"Price stability, which is one leg of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate from the Congress, is a good thing in itself, for reasons that economists understand much better today than they did a few decades ago.",2007-07-10
"Inflation injects noise into the price system, makes long-term financial planning more complex, and interacts in perverse ways with imperfectly indexed tax and accounting rules.",2007-07-10
"In the short-to-medium term, the maintenance of price stability helps avoid the pattern of stop-go monetary policies that were the source of much instability in output and employment in the past.",2007-07-10
"More fundamentally, experience suggests that high and persistent inflation undermines public confidence in the economy and in the management of economic policy generally, with potentially adverse effects on risk-taking, investment, and other productive activities that are sensitive to the public's assessments of the prospects for future economic stability.",2007-07-10
"In the long term, low inflation promotes growth, efficiency, and stability--which, all else being equal, support maximum sustainable employment, the other leg of the mandate given to the Federal Reserve by the Congress.",2007-07-10
"Admittedly, measuring the long-term relationship between growth or productivity and inflation is difficult.",2007-07-10
"For example, it may be that low inflation has accompanied good economic performance in part because countries that maintain low inflation tend to pursue other sound economic policies as well.",2007-07-10
"Still, I think we can agree that, at a minimum, the opposite proposition--that inflationary policies promote employment growth in the long run--has been entirely discredited and, indeed, that policies based on this proposition have led to very bad outcomes whenever they have been applied.",2007-07-10
"Inflation Expectations: Conceptual FrameworksUndoubtedly, the state of inflation expectations greatly influences actual inflation and thus the central bank's ability to achieve price stability.",2007-07-10
"But what do we mean, precisely, by ""the state of inflation expectations""?",2007-07-10
"How should we measure inflation expectations, and how should we use that information for forecasting and controlling inflation?",2007-07-10
What is the right conceptual framework for thinking about inflation expectations in the current context?,2007-07-10
"The traditional rational-expectations model of inflation and inflation expectations has been a useful workhorse for thinking about issues of credibility and institutional design, but, to my mind, it is less helpful for thinking about economies in which (1) the structure of the economy is constantly evolving in ways that are imperfectly understood by both the public and policymakers and (2) the policymakers' objective function is not fully known by private agents.",2007-07-10
"In particular, together with the assumption that the central bank's objective function is fixed and known to the public, the traditional rational-expectations approach implies that the public has firm knowledge of the long-run equilibrium inflation rate; consequently, their long-run inflation expectations do not vary over time in response to new information.",2007-07-10
"But in fact, as I will discuss in more detail later, long-run inflation expectations do vary over time.",2007-07-10
"That is, they are not perfectly anchored in real economies; moreover, the extent to which they are anchored can change, depending on economic developments and (most important) the current and past conduct of monetary policy.",2007-07-10
"So, for example, if the public experiences a spell of inflation higher than their long-run expectation, but their long-run expectation of inflation changes little as a result, then inflation expectations are well anchored.",2007-07-10
"If, on the other hand, the public reacts to a short period of higher-than-expected inflation by marking up their long-run expectation considerably, then expectations are poorly anchored.",2007-07-10
"Although variations in the extent to which inflation expectations are anchored are not easily handled in a traditional rational-expectations framework, they seem to fit quite naturally into the burgeoning literature on learning in macroeconomics.",2007-07-10
"In a learning context, the concept of anchored expectations is easily formalized in a variety of ways; in general, if the public is modeled as being confident in its current estimate of the long-run inflation rate, so that new information has relatively little effect on that estimate, then the essential idea of well-anchored expectations has been captured.",2007-07-10
"Considerations of how the public learns about the economy affect the form of optimal monetary policy (Gaspar, Smets, and Vestin, 2006).",2007-07-10
"For example, if the central bank and the public learn from experience that high inflation imposes greater costs and fewer benefits than previously thought, then the equilibrium will adjust toward one with lower inflation and lower inflation expectations.",2007-07-10
Implications of Anchored Inflation ExpectationsWhy do we care about the variability of inflation expectations?,2007-07-10
"As my colleague Rick Mishkin recently discussed, the extent to which inflation expectations are anchored has first-order implications for the performance of inflation and of the economy more generally (Mishkin, 2007).",2007-07-10
"Mishkin illustrated this point by considering the implications of the fact that inflation expectations have become much better anchored over the past thirty years for the estimated coefficients of the conventional Phillips curve, which I define here to encompass specifications that use lagged values of inflation to proxy for expectations or other sources of inflation inertia.",2007-07-10
"As he noted, many studies of the conventional Phillips curve find that the sensitivity of inflation to activity indicators is lower today than in the past (that is, the Phillips curve appears to have become flatter);1 and that the long-run effect on inflation of ""supply shocks,"" such as changes in the price of oil, also appears to be lower than in the past (Hooker, 2002).",2007-07-10
"To the extent that the Phillips curve may have flattened, inflation will now tend to be more stable than in the past in the face of variations in aggregate demand.",2007-07-10
"(Of course, this can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on whether inflation expectations are anchored in the vicinity of price stability.)",2007-07-10
"Likewise, a lower sensitivity of long-run inflation to supply shocks would imply that such shocks are much less likely to generate economic instability today than they would have been several decades ago.",2007-07-10
"Notably, the sharp increases in energy prices over the past few years have not led either to persistent inflation or to a recession, in contrast (for example) to the U.S. experience of the 1970s.",2007-07-10
"Various factors might account for these changes in the Phillips curve, but, as Mishkin pointed out, better-anchored inflation expectations--themselves, of course, the product of monetary policies that brought inflation down and have kept it relatively stable--certainly play some role.",2007-07-10
"If people set prices and wages with reference to the rate of inflation they expect in the long run and if inflation expectations respond less than previously to variations in economic activity, then inflation itself will become relatively more insensitive to the level of activity--that is, the conventional Phillips curve will be flatter.",2007-07-10
Similar logic explains the finding that inflation is less responsive than it used to be to changes in oil prices and other supply shocks.,2007-07-10
"Certainly, increases in energy prices affect overall inflation in the short run because energy products such as gasoline are part of the consumer's basket and because energy costs loom large in the production of some goods and services.",2007-07-10
"However, a one-off change in energy prices can translate into persistent inflation only if it leads to higher expected inflation and a consequent ""wage-price spiral.""",2007-07-10
"With inflation expectations well anchored, a one-time increase in energy prices should not lead to a permanent increase in inflation but only to a change in relative prices.",2007-07-10
"A related implication is that, if inflation expectations are well anchored, changes in energy (and food) prices should have relatively little influence on ""core"" inflation, that is, inflation excluding the prices of food and energy.",2007-07-10
"Although inflation expectations seem much better anchored today than they were a few decades ago, they appear to remain imperfectly anchored.",2007-07-10
"For example, Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2005) found that long-run inflation expectations, as measured by the difference in yields between nominal and inflation-indexed bonds, move in response to news about the economy, rather than remaining unaffected.",2007-07-10
"Levin, Natalucci, and Piger (2004) have shown that some survey measures of inflation expectations in the United States respond to recent changes in the actual rate of inflation, which would not be the case if expectations were perfectly anchored.",2007-07-10
"Models of the term structure of interest rates better fit the data under the assumption that both inflation expectations and beliefs about the central bank's reaction function are evolving (Kozicki and Tinsley, 2001; Rudebusch and Wu, 2003; Cogley, 2005).",2007-07-10
An indirect but elegant way to make the point that inflation expectations remain imperfectly anchored comes from a statistical analysis of inflation by Stock and Watson (2007).,2007-07-10
"Stock and Watson model inflation as having two components, which may be interpreted as the trend and the cycle.",2007-07-10
Changes in the trend component are highly persistent whereas shocks to the cyclical component are temporary.2 The key finding of this research is that the variability of the trend component of inflation (and thus the share of the overall variability of inflation that it can explain) appears to have fallen significantly after about 1983.,2007-07-10
"That is, unexpected changes in inflation are today much more likely to be transitory than they were before the early 1980s.",2007-07-10
"Because it seems quite unlikely that changes in inflation could persist indefinitely unless long-run expectations of inflation also changed, I interpret the Stock-Watson finding as consistent with the view that inflation expectations have become much more anchored since the early 1980s.",2007-07-10
"At the same time, that the variability of the trend component of inflation, though modest, remains positive, implies that long-run expectations of inflation are not perfectly anchored today.",2007-07-10
The policy implications of the much-improved but still imperfect anchoring of inflation expectations are not at all straightforward.,2007-07-10
"To evaluate these implications, we must understand better the historical variation in inflation expectations, the effect of this variation on actual inflation and economic activity, and the relationship between policy actions and the formation of inflation expectations.",2007-07-10
"First, how should the central bank best monitor the public's inflation expectations?",2007-07-10
"Theoretical treatments tend to neglect the fact that in practice many measures of inflation expectations exist, including the forecasts of professional economists, results from surveys of consumers, information extracted from financial markets such as the market for inflation-indexed debt, and limited information on firms' pricing plans.",2007-07-10
"In a very interesting paper, Mankiw, Reis, and Wolfers (2003) compared the available measures, emphasizing in particular that median measures of inflation expectations often obscure substantial cross-sectional dispersion of expectations.3 On which measure or combination of measures should central bankers focus to assess inflation developments and the degree to which expectations are anchored?",2007-07-10
"Information on the price expectations of businesses--who are, after all, the price setters in the first instance--as well as information on nominal wage expectations is particularly scarce.",2007-07-10
"Second, how do changes in various measures of inflation expectations feed through to actual pricing behavior?",2007-07-10
"Promising recent research has looked at price changes at very disaggregated levels for insight into the pricing decision (Bils and Klenow, 2004; Nakamura and Steinsson, 2007).",2007-07-10
But this research has not yet linked pricing decisions at the microeconomic level to inflation expectations; undertaking that next step would no doubt be difficult but also very valuable.,2007-07-10
"Third, what factors affect the level of inflation expectations and the degree to which they are anchored?",2007-07-10
"A fuller understanding of the public's learning rules would improve the central bank's capacity to assess its own credibility, to evaluate the implications of its policy decisions and communications strategy, and perhaps to forecast inflation.",2007-07-10
Inflation Forecasting at the Federal ReserveI would like to shift gears at this point to tell you a bit about how the Federal Reserve Board staff goes about forecasting inflation.,2007-07-10
"Obviously, this activity provides critical inputs into the making of monetary policy, and as I will discuss, the staff's long-term track record in forecasting inflation is quite good by any reasonable benchmark.",2007-07-10
"But, as you will see, the discussion of practical inflation forecasting will bring us back to one theme of my remarks--that our ability to forecast inflation and predict how inflation will respond to policy actions depends very much on our capacity to measure and to understand what determines the public's expectations of inflation.",2007-07-10
"However, the forecasts of inflation (and of other key macroeconomic variables) that are provided to the Federal Open Market Committee are developed through an eclectic process that combines model-based projections, anecdotal and other ""extra-model"" information, and professional judgment.",2007-07-10
"For near-term inflation forecasting--say, for the current quarter and the next--the staff relies most heavily on a disaggregated, bottom-up approach that focuses on estimating and forecasting price behavior for the various categories of goods and services that make up the aggregate price index in question.",2007-07-10
"For example, we know from historical experience that the prices of some types of goods and services tend to be quite volatile, including not only (as is well known) the prices of energy and some types of food but also some ""core"" prices such as airfares, apparel prices, and hotel rates.",2007-07-10
The monthly autocorrelations of price changes in these categories tend to be low or even negative.,2007-07-10
"In contrast, changes in inflation rates in some services categories, such as shelter costs, tend to be more persistent.",2007-07-10
"In assessing what price changes in a particular category imply for future price changes in that category, the staff uses not only various forms of time-series analysis but also specialized knowledge about how the various indexes are constructed--for example, whether certain categories are sampled every month in all localities and how seasonal adjustments are performed.",2007-07-10
"In making very near-term price forecasts, the staff also uses diverse information from a variety of sources, such as surveys of prices of gasoline and other important items, news reports about price-change announcements, and anecdotal information from our business contacts.",2007-07-10
"Conceptually, one might think of this effort to distinguish transitory from persistent price changes as a more nuanced way of estimating the underlying inflation trend, analogous to the trend measures provided by more mechanical indicators such as trimmed-mean or weighted-median inflation rates.",2007-07-10
"An accurate forecast of very near-term inflation is important not only for its own sake but also because it provides a better ""jumping-off point"" for the longer-term forecast.",2007-07-10
"Because inflation continues to exhibit some inertia, improved near-term forecasts translate into more-accurate longer-term projections as well.",2007-07-10
"For forecasting horizons beyond a quarter or two, detailed analyses of individual price components become less useful, and thus the staff's emphasis shifts to inflation's fundamental determinants.",2007-07-10
"Food and energy inflation are forecasted separately from the core, using information from futures prices and other sources.",2007-07-10
"However, forecasts of core inflation must take into account the extent to which food and energy costs are passed through to other prices.",2007-07-10
"To project core inflation at longer-term horizons, the staff consults a range of econometric models.",2007-07-10
"Most of the models used are based on versions of the new Keynesian Phillips curve, which links inflation to inflation expectations, the extent of economic slack, and indicators of supply shocks.",2007-07-10
"Despite the common conceptual framework, the model specifications employed differ considerably in their details, including how lagged inflation enters the equation, how resource utilization is measured, and whether a survey-based measure of inflation expectations is included.",2007-07-10
"Because of these considerations, as I have already noted, the staff's inflation forecasts inevitably reflect a substantial degree of expert judgment and the use of information not captured by the models.",2007-07-10
"Another reason for the reliance on judgment in the forecasting process is the practical requirement that the forecast for inflation be consistent with the staff's overall view of the economy, including the forecasts for key economic variables such as wages, interest rates, and consumption spending.",2007-07-10
"Again, in principle, consistency of sectoral forecasts could be ensured by estimating the inflation equation as part of a general equilibrium system.",2007-07-10
A potential drawback of the simple Phillips curve model for analyzing and forecasting inflation is that it does not explicitly incorporate the possible influence of labor costs on the inflation process.,2007-07-10
"The Board's large macroeconomic simulation model, known as FRB/US, projects inflation through a system approach that captures the interaction of wage and price determination.",2007-07-10
"Interestingly, however, the system approach does not seem to forecast price inflation as well as single-equation Phillips curve models do.",2007-07-10
The two principal quarterly indicators of aggregate hourly compensation are the employment cost index (ECI) and nonfarm compensation per hour (CPH).,2007-07-10
"For example, the ECI's fixed employment and occupation weights may not reflect changes in the labor market, and the ECI excludes stock options and similar forms of payment.",2007-07-10
"Despite these problems, labor market developments certainly influence how the staff and policymakers view the inflation process and inflation risks, illustrating yet another point in the forecasting process at which judgment must play an important role.",2007-07-10
"Overall, the Board staff's inflation forecasting has been remarkably good, at least compared with the available alternatives (Romer and Romer, 2000; Sims, 2002).",2007-07-10
"To cite a recent study, Faust and Wright (2007) show that real-time staff forecasts of inflation reliably outperform statistical benchmarks at all horizons and that this advantage is not solely the result of the staff's expertise at estimating near-term inflation rates.",2007-07-10
"To link this discussion of forecasting to the first portion of my remarks, I turn to the treatment of inflation expectations in staff forecasts.",2007-07-10
"As I noted earlier, while inflation expectations doubtless are crucial determinants of observed inflation, measuring expectations and inferring just how they affect inflation are difficult tasks.",2007-07-10
"A popular shortcut is to include lagged inflation terms in the Phillips curve equation; besides being a convenient means of capturing the inertial component in inflation, the estimated coefficients on lagged inflation almost certainly reflect to some degree the formation of inflation expectations and their influence on the inflation process.",2007-07-10
"However, using lagged inflation as a proxy for inflation expectations has drawbacks, notably its susceptibility to the Lucas critique.4 The staff consequently analyzes a number of survey measures of inflation expectations.",2007-07-10
"One question in choosing among measures of expectations is whether to focus on measures of short-term inflation expectations (say, twelve months ahead) or of longer-term expectations (five to ten years ahead).",2007-07-10
"Generally, measures of longer-term inflation expectations, such as the five-to-ten-year expected inflation measures from the Michigan/Reuters survey of households and from the Survey of Professional Forecasters, seem to be better gauges of the expectations that influence wage- and price-setting behavior.",2007-07-10
The staff also looks at measures derived from comparing yields on nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury securities (the breakeven inflation rate).,2007-07-10
"Measures of inflation compensation derived from the market for inflation-indexed securities are influenced by changes in inflation risk premiums and liquidity premiums, and analyses are constrained by the fact that these markets have been operating in the United States for only a relatively short period.",2007-07-10
"Nevertheless, unlike survey measures, breakeven inflation rates are determined in a market in which investors back their views with real money.",2007-07-10
"Moreover, breakeven measures of inflation expectations provide information on the expectations of a different group of agents--financial-market participants--which can be compared with the views of economists and consumers as represented by surveys.",2007-07-10
Measurement is only one aspect of understanding inflation expectations.,2007-07-10
We also need a better understanding of how inflation expectations affect actual inflation and of the factors that determine inflation expectations.,2007-07-10
Model-based simulations of the inflation process are useful tools for both forecasting and policy analysis.,2007-07-10
"In conducting such simulations, the analyst must specify how inflation expectations are formed--in particular, how they react to actual changes in the economy and in policy.",2007-07-10
"In most simulations of the FRB/US model, the public is assumed to update its inflation projections based on the historical relationship between inflation and other key economic variables.",2007-07-10
"Essentially, this approach assumes that the public updates its inflation expectations in a sensible way based on economic developments but does not assume that the public has full knowledge of the underlying model of the economy, consistent with the structure of learning models (Brayton and others, 1997).",2007-07-10
"Recent staff work at the Board has analyzed the implications of expanding the set of variables allowed to influence the public's long-term inflation expectations to include, among others, the federal funds rate.5 If the public's long-term inflation expectations are influenced directly by Fed actions, as this specification suggests, a number of interesting implications follow.",2007-07-10
One is that the output costs of disinflation may be lower than those suggested by reduced-form-type Phillips curves.,2007-07-10
"Intuitively, if the Fed attempts to disinflate by raising the federal funds rate, the disinflationary effect will be felt not only through the usual output gap channel but also through a direct restraint on long-term inflation expectations.",2007-07-10
"This interpretation is consistent with some analyses of the Volcker disinflation; although the costs of that disinflation were high, they were perhaps less than economists would have predicted in advance, given conventional estimates of the sacrifice ratio (Erceg and Levin, 2003).",2007-07-10
"Although your papers concentrate on the equity premium, I would like to take a few minutes today to broaden the discussion to encompass risk premiums in other markets and to highlight the connections between risk premiums and monetary policy.",2005-07-21
"My goal is not to draw conclusions on recent movements in risk premiums but rather to give you a sense of how estimates of risk premiums may influence our policy decisionmaking, to note some of the difficulties that we face in interpreting their movements, and, I hope, to stimulate further research in this already fertile field.1 At the Federal Reserve, we pay a lot of attention to financial market prices in the formulation of monetary policy.",2005-07-21
"Financial markets are the channel through which our policy affects the economy, and asset prices contain valuable information about investors' expectations for the course of policy, economic activity, and inflation, as well as about the risks around those expectations.",2005-07-21
An important element in interpreting financial market prices is the identification of the risk premiums they contain.,2005-07-21
"To be clear, when I say ""risk premium"" I mean the additional compensation required by investors for holding a risky security--that is, one with uncertain returns--above the compensation that would be demanded by risk-neutral investors who care only about expected returns.",2005-07-21
"For example, while a risk-neutral investor would demand a certain spread on a junk bond over a risk-free rate of the same maturity as compensation for expected losses, a risk-averse investor likely requires an even wider spread depending on the covariance characteristics of the bond's total return.",2005-07-21
"Booming demand for goods and the strength and speed of the reopening have led to shortages and bottlenecks, leaving the COVID-constrained supply side unable to keep up.",2021-08-27
"The result has been elevated inflation in durable goodsâ€”a sector that has experienced an annual inflation rate well below zero over the past quarter century.1 Labor market conditions are improving but turbulent, and the pandemic continues to threaten not only health and life, but also economic activity.",2021-08-27
"In my comments today, I will focus on the Fed's efforts to promote our maximum employment and price stability goals amid this upheaval, and suggest how lessons from history and a careful focus on incoming data and the evolving risks offer useful guidance for today's unique monetary policy challenges.",2021-08-27
"As is typically the case, the recovery in employment has lagged that in output; nonetheless, employment gains have also come faster than expected.4 The economic downturn has not fallen equally on all Americans, and those least able to shoulder the burden have been hardest hit.",2021-08-27
"Total employment is now 6 million below its February 2020 level, and 5 million of that shortfall is in the still-depressed service sector.",2021-08-27
"With demand outstripping pandemic-afflicted supply, rising durables prices are a principal factor lifting inflation well above our 2 percent objective.",2021-08-27
The job of monetary policy is to promote maximum employment and price stability as the economy works through this challenging period.,2021-08-27
The Path Ahead: Maximum Employment The outlook for the labor market has brightened considerably in recent months.,2021-08-27
"The levels of job openings and quits are at record highs, and employers report that they cannot fill jobs fast enough to meet returning demand.",2021-08-27
These favorable conditions for job seekers should help the economy cover the considerable remaining ground to reach maximum employment.,2021-08-27
"The unemployment rate has declined to 5.4 percent, a post-pandemic low, but is still much too high, and the reported rate understates the amount of labor market slack.5 Long-term unemployment remains elevated, and the recovery in labor force participation has lagged well behind the rest of the labor market, as it has in past recoveries.",2021-08-27
"With vaccinations rising, schools reopening, and enhanced unemployment benefits ending, some factors that may be holding back job seekers are likely fading.6 While the Delta variant presents a near-term risk, the prospects are good for continued progress toward maximum employment.",2021-08-27
The Path Ahead: Inflation The rapid reopening of the economy has brought a sharp run-up in inflation.,2021-08-27
"Over the 12 months through July, measures of headline and core personal consumption expenditures inflation have run at 4.2 percent and 3.6 percent, respectivelyâ€”well above our 2 percent longer-run objective.7 Businesses and consumers widely report upward pressure on prices and wages.",2021-08-27
"Inflation at these levels is, of course, a cause for concern.",2021-08-27
"The dynamics of inflation are complex, and we assess the inflation outlook from a number of different perspectives, as I will now discuss.",2021-08-27
The absence so far of broad-based inflation pressures The spike in inflation is so far largely the product of a relatively narrow group of goods and services that have been directly affected by the pandemic and the reopening of the economy.,2021-08-27
Durable goods alone contributed about 1 percentage point to the latest 12â€‘month measures of headline and core inflation.,2021-08-27
"Energy prices, which rebounded with the strong recovery, added another 0.8 percentage point to headline inflation, and from long experience we expect the inflation effects of these increases to be transitory.",2021-08-27
"In addition, some pricesâ€”for example, for hotel rooms and airplane ticketsâ€”declined sharply during the recession and have now moved back up close to pre-pandemic levels.",2021-08-27
"The 12-month window we use in computing inflation now captures the rebound in prices but not the initial decline, temporarily elevating reported inflation.",2021-08-27
"These effects, which are adding a few tenths to measured inflation, should wash out over time.",2021-08-27
We consult a range of measures meant to capture whether price increases for particular items are spilling over into broad-based inflation.,2021-08-27
These measures generally show inflation at or close to our 2 percent longer-run objective (figure 3).,2021-08-27
We would be concerned at signs that inflationary pressures were spreading more broadly through the economy.,2021-08-27
"Moderating inflation in higher-inflation items We are also directly monitoring the prices of particular goods and services most affected by the pandemic and the reopening, and are beginning to see a moderation in some cases as shortages ease.",2021-08-27
"Used car prices, for example, appear to have stabilized; indeed, some price indicators are beginning to fall.",2021-08-27
"If that continues, as many analysts predict, then used car prices will soon be pulling measured inflation down, as they did for much of the past decade.8 This same dynamic of upward inflation pressure dissipating and, in some cases, reversing seems likely to play out in durables more generally.",2021-08-27
"Over the 25 years preceding the pandemic, durables prices actually declined, with inflation averaging negative 1.9 percent per year (figure 5).9 As supply problems have begun to resolve, inflation in durable goods other than autos has now slowed and may be starting to fall.",2021-08-27
It seems unlikely that durables inflation will continue to contribute importantly over time to overall inflation.,2021-08-27
Wages We also assess whether wage increases are consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.,2021-08-27
"But if wage increases were to move materially and persistently above the levels of productivity gains and inflation, businesses would likely pass those increases on to customers, a process that could become the sort of ""wageâ€“price spiral"" seen at times in the past.10 Today we see little evidence of wage increases that might threaten excessive inflation (figure 6).",2021-08-27
"Broad-based measures of wages that adjust for compositional changes in the labor force, such as the employment cost index and the Atlanta Wage Growth Tracker, show wages moving up at a pace that appears consistent with our longer-term inflation objective.",2021-08-27
"Longer-term inflation expectations Policymakers and analysts generally believe that, as long as longer-term inflation expectations remain anchored, policy can and should look through temporary swings in inflation.",2021-08-27
Our monetary policy framework emphasizes that anchoring longer-term expectations at 2 percent is important for both maximum employment and price stability.,2021-08-27
We carefully monitor a wide range of indicators of longer-term inflation expectations.,2021-08-27
"Because measures of inflation expectations are individually noisy, we also focus on common patterns across the measures.",2021-08-27
"One approach to summarizing these patterns is the Board staff's index of common inflation expectations (CIE), which combines information from a broad range of survey and market-based measures.11 This index captures a general move down in expectations starting around 2014, a time when inflation was running persistently below 2 percent.",2021-08-27
"Longer-term inflation expectations have moved much less than actual inflation or near-term expectations, suggesting that households, businesses, and market participants also believe that current high inflation readings are likely to prove transitory and that, in any case, the Fed will keep inflation close to our 2 percent objective over time.12 5.",2021-08-27
"The prevalence of global disinflationary forces over the past quarter century Finally, it is worth noting that, since the 1990s, inflation in many advanced economies has run somewhat below 2 percent even in good times (figure 7).",2021-08-27
"The pattern of low inflation likely reflects sustained disinflationary forces, including technology, globalization and perhaps demographic factors, as well as a stronger and more successful commitment by central banks to maintain price stability.13 In the United States, unemployment ran below 4 percent for about two years before the pandemic, while inflation ran at or below 2 percent.",2021-08-27
Wages did move up across the income spectrumâ€”a welcome developmentâ€”but not by enough to lift price inflation consistently to 2 percent.,2021-08-27
"While the underlying global disinflationary factors are likely to evolve over time, there is little reason to think that they have suddenly reversed or abated.",2021-08-27
It seems more likely that they will continue to weigh on inflation as the pandemic passes into history.14 We will continue to monitor incoming inflation data against each of these assessments.,2021-08-27
"To sum up, the baseline outlook is for continued progress toward maximum employment, with inflation returning to levels consistent with our goal of inflation averaging 2 percent over time.",2021-08-27
Let me now turn to how the baseline outlook and the associated risks and uncertainties figure in our monetary policymaking.,2021-08-27
Implications for Monetary Policy The period from 1950 through the early 1980s provides two important lessons for managing the risks and uncertainties we face today.,2021-08-27
"The early days of stabilization policy in the 1950s taught monetary policymakers not to attempt to offset what are likely to be temporary fluctuations in inflation.15 Indeed, responding may do more harm than good, particularly in an era where policy rates are much closer to the effective lower bound even in good times.",2021-08-27
The main influence of monetary policy on inflation can come after a lag of a year or more.,2021-08-27
The ill-timed policy move unnecessarily slows hiring and other economic activity and pushes inflation lower than desired.,2021-08-27
"We know that extended periods of unemployment can mean lasting harm to workers and to the productive capacity of the economy.16 History also teaches, however, that central banks cannot take for granted that inflation due to transitory factors will fade.",2021-08-27
"The 1970s saw two periods in which there were large increases in energy and food prices, raising headline inflation for a time.",2021-08-27
"But when the direct effects on headline inflation eased, core inflation continued to run persistently higher than before.",2021-08-27
"One likely contributing factor was that the public had come to generally expect higher inflationâ€”one reason why we now monitor inflation expectations so carefully.17 Central banks have always faced the problem of distinguishing transitory inflation spikes from more troublesome developments, and it is sometimes difficult to do so with confidence in real time.",2021-08-27
"If sustained higher inflation were to become a serious concern, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would certainly respond and use our tools to assure that inflation runs at levels that are consistent with our goal.",2021-08-27
"Incoming data should provide more evidence that some of the supplyâ€“demand imbalances are improving, and more evidence of a continued moderation in inflation, particularly in goods and services prices that have been most affected by the pandemic.",2021-08-27
That brings me to a concluding word on the path ahead for monetary policy.,2021-08-27
The changes we made last year to our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy are well suited to address today's challenges.,2021-08-27
"We have said that we would continue our asset purchases at the current pace until we see substantial further progress toward our maximum employment and price stability goals, measured since last December, when we first articulated this guidance.",2021-08-27
"My view is that the ""substantial further progress"" test has been met for inflation.",2021-08-27
There has also been clear progress toward maximum employment.,2021-08-27
"The intervening month has brought more progress in the form of a strong employment report for July, but also the further spread of the Delta variant.",2021-08-27
"The timing and pace of the coming reduction in asset purchases will not be intended to carry a direct signal regarding the timing of interest rate liftoff, for which we have articulated a different and substantially more stringent test.",2021-08-27
"We have said that we will continue to hold the target range for the federal funds rate at its current level until the economy reaches conditions consistent with maximum employment, and inflation has reached 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.",2021-08-27
"We have much ground to cover to reach maximum employment, and time will tell whether we have reached 2 percent inflation on a sustainable basis.",2021-08-27
"These are challenging times for the public we serve, as the pandemic and its unprecedented toll on health and economic activity linger.",2021-08-27

"Current Economic Situation and Outlook In the second quarter of last year, the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic and the mitigation efforts put in place to contain it delivered the most severe blow to the U.S. economy since the Great Depression, but economic activity rebounded sharply in the third quarter, supported by a robust and unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy response.",2021-02-24
"Although more than half of the 22 million jobs that were lost last spring have been regained, the unemployment rate remained elevated at 6.3 percent in January, and once one factors in the decline in the labor force since the onset of the pandemic and misclassification, the true unemployment rate is closer to 10 percent.",2021-02-24
"Core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation is running at just 1.5 percent, and, for those sectors that have been most adversely affected by the pandemic, price increases remain subdued.",2021-02-24
"The housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn, supported in part by low mortgage interest rates.",2021-02-24
"And while the economy might not continue to grow at the once-in-a-century 33 percent annualized rate of growth reported in the third quarter of 2020, it is clear that the economy has turned out to be more resilient in adapting to the virus, and more responsive to monetary and fiscal policy support, than many predicted.",2021-02-24
"Indeed, it is worth highlighting that in the baseline projections of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) presented in the latest Summary of Economic Projections, released last December, most of my colleagues and I revised up our outlooks for the economy over the medium term, projecting a relatively rapid return to levels of employment and inflation consistent with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate as compared with the recovery from the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).2 In particular, the median FOMC participant projected in December that by the end of 2023â€”a little less than three years from nowâ€”the unemployment rate will have fallen below 4 percent, and PCE inflation will have returned to 2 percent.",2021-02-24
"Following the GFC, it took more than eight years for employment and inflation to return to similar mandate-consistent levels.",2021-02-24
"Recent FOMC Decisions and the New Monetary Policy Framework At our most recent FOMC meetings, the Committee made important changes to our policy statement that upgraded our forward guidance about the future path of the federal funds rate and asset purchases, and that also provided unprecedented information about our policy reaction function.",2021-02-24
"As announced in the September statement and reiterated in the following statements, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, our policy will aim to achieve inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal.3 We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomesâ€”as well as our maximum-employment mandateâ€”are achieved.",2021-02-24
"We also expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.",2021-02-24
We indicated that we will continue to increase our holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and our holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.,2021-02-24
"The changes to the policy statement that we made over the past few FOMC meetings bring our policy guidance in line with the new framework outlined in the revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that the Committee approved last August.4 In our new framework, we acknowledge that policy decisions going forward will be based on the FOMC's estimates of ""shortfalls [emphasis added] of employment from its maximum level""â€”not ""deviations.""",2021-02-24
"This language means that going forward, a low unemployment rate, in and of itself, will not be sufficient to trigger a tightening of monetary policy absent any evidence from other indicators that inflation is at risk of moving above mandate-consistent levels.",2021-02-24
"With regard to our price-stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importanceâ€”and the challengeâ€”of keeping inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent in a world in which an effective-lower-bound constraint is, in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate.",2021-02-24
"To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it ""seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,"" andâ€”in the same sentenceâ€”that therefore ""following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.""",2021-02-24
"As Chair Powell indicated in his Jackson Hole remarks, we think of our new framework as an evolution from ""flexible inflation targeting"" to ""flexible average inflation targeting.",2021-02-24
"""5 While this new framework represents a robust evolution in our monetary policy strategy, this strategy is in service to the dual-mandate goals of monetary policy assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congressâ€”maximum employment and price stabilityâ€”which remain unchanged.6 Concluding Remarks While our interest rate and balance sheet tools are providing powerful support to the economy and will continue to do so as the recovery progresses, it will take some time for economic activity and employment to return to levels that prevailed at the business cycle peak reached last February.",2021-02-24
"I hope that at the end of this talk you will conclude, as I do, that while the concept of the equilibrium real rate is a useful aid in thinking about setting monetary policy, it is not measured and observed with such precision as to provide a practical guide to the appropriate stance of policy.",2004-10-29
"Supported by ongoing advances in productivity and the attendant increases in real incomes, household spending has picked up.",2004-10-29
"No doubt the recent run-up in energy prices poses some challenges, but the evidence indicates that, without some further material shock, aggregate demand is on a track consistent with sustained economic growth.",2004-10-29
"That should gradually return the economy to full utilization of its resources, while inflation remains subdued.",2004-10-29
"After all, spending decisions should depend on real, not nominal, determinants, including the real federal funds rate, which is the nominal federal funds rate less prevailing inflation expectations.",2004-10-29
"Although backward-looking measures of inflation--such as the four-quarter growth in core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) prices--imply that the FOMC's cumulative 75 basis points of tightening so far this year has moved the real federal funds rate into positive territory for the first time in almost three years, that observation is not sufficient to calibrate the stance of policy.",2004-10-29
"It is only against a backdrop of an economy that seems poised to maintain sustained and solid economic growth, even as the funds rate rises, that the FOMC can determine that current policy is accommodative.",2004-10-29
"The Equilibrium Rate in Theory What is needed is a benchmark summarizing the economic circumstances--including, among other variables, the underlying strength of aggregate demand, the level of aggregate wealth, and economic developments in our trading partners--combining to shape the expansion of activity and the extent of pressures on inflation.",2004-10-29
"One way of providing that benchmark is to consider what level of the real federal funds rate, if allowed to prevail for several years, would place economic activity at its potential and keep inflation low and stable.",2004-10-29
"It also makes clear that the concept involves a good amount of judgment--indeed, the same judgment that goes into making any economic forecast--about the determinants of spending, the trend of productivity, and the forces affecting inflation in the intermediate term.",2004-10-29
"The real interest rate consistent with the eventual full utilization of resources has been called the equilibrium real federal funds rate, the natural rate of interest, and the neutral real rate.",2004-10-29
The average interest rate that seems to have brought aggregate demand and aggregate supply into rough balance in the past may not be the same rate required in every conjunctural setting.,2004-10-29
"Our inability to equate the long-run average interest rate to the equilibrium real interest rate that is relevant for setting policy is not surprising given the manner in which economic behavior, technology, and government policy can change over time.",2004-10-29
"That said, policymakers do strive to understand what the equilibrium real interest rate will be over the long run, but that is a forward-looking notion that depends on our sense of how the forces of productivity and thrift will evolve over time as measured in decades.",2004-10-29
"An understanding of a likely long-run level of the equilibrium real rate is useful, even though the level is not directly observable, because it provides a general sense of the level that would, over that longer period, allow aggregate supply and demand to move into balance, given the evaluation of secular forces such as productivity and population growth.",2004-10-29
"Such an understanding of the longer-term prospects for the real interest rate aids in identifying variations in the concept over the intermediate run that is relevant for setting monetary policy--a period of several years, when cyclical forces dominate.",2004-10-29
"For example, an unusual hesitancy on the part of businesses to hire and spend emerged in 2001 after the collapse of equity prices and was subsequently reinforced by corporate-governance concerns; this hesitancy could be thought of as pulling the equilibrium real federal funds rate down temporarily below its longer-run value.",2004-10-29
"In addition, other forces may also have weighed on growth, making it appropriate to move the real funds rate below the intermediate-run equilibrium for a time.",2004-10-29
"From that perspective, the FOMC's reduction in the actual nominal federal funds rate over this period from the level of 6-1/2 percent that prevailed at the beginning of 2001 to the forty-five-year low of 1 percent by mid-2003 had three components: (1) A reduction to match the decline in inflation expectations so as to prevent the real funds rate from rising inappropriately, (2) an effort to chase a downwardly moving equilibrium real rate given the pressures on aggregate demand, and (3) an effort to bring the actual real rate below its apparently lowered equilibrium to provide sufficient stimulus to cope with transitory adverse factors and to speed the recovery in production and employment.",2004-10-29
This is a tangible recent example of the need both to judge how the equilibrium real interest rate that is relevant for policy might have changed from a perceived long-run level and to set policy against the background of such an understanding.,2004-10-29
"And, in the context of well-contained inflation, the evidence of remaining underused resources gives us a good reason to hold the real rate below even the intermediate-run notion of its equilibrium to allow the economy to be firmly set on a path that will shrink the pool of these underused resources over a reasonable period.",2004-10-29
I have already mentioned the role of business hesitancy in determining the past trajectory of monetary policy.,2004-10-29
"I believe that the combined force of these three factors restraining aggregate demand, plus others that I have not mentioned, would require a lower real rate than otherwise to avoid economic slack.",2004-10-29
"The rapid expansion of labor productivity has raised the growth of economic potential, increased permanent income and wealth, and created an important inducement to add to the capital stock.",2004-10-29
"All else equal, a higher growth rate of productivity will be associated with a more elevated equilibrium real rate.",2004-10-29
"As long as productivity grows steadily at its recent pace, however, there is no reason to suspect that it will produce a change in the equilibrium real rate.",2004-10-29
Business hesitancy might lift abruptly and would be evidenced by large increases in business demand for capital and labor resources; households might maintain a very low savings rate; and government policy might not return quickly to a more-balanced posture.,2004-10-29
"Any of these factors might imply that the equilibrium rate relevant for policy returns more quickly to, or even moves above, its long-run level as fewer forces weigh on aggregate demand.",2004-10-29
"Otherwise, we risk a buildup of inflationary pressures.",2004-10-29
"The first can be thought of as a mechanical attempt to implement my definition--the level of the real federal funds rate that, if allowed to prevail for a couple of years, would place economic activity at its potential--in models of the U.S. economy.",2004-10-29
An alternative approach turns to financial markets to infer the market's assessment of the longer-term prospects for real interest rates.,2004-10-29
"Since 1997, the U.S. Treasury has been issuing price-index-linked securities providing an assured real return.",2004-10-29
"With about $250 billion of these inflation-protected securities now outstanding, we can get readings along the entire maturity structure of real interest rates.",2004-10-29
"One could presume that the forward real rate of interest implied by yields on longer-term indexed debt--or the real return provided, say, over the period five to ten years from now--conveys a sense of market participants' view of the long-run equilibrium real interest rate.3 Unfortunately for such an inference, however, longer-term yields embody expectations of future interest rates, a term premium, and potentially a premium for the relative illiquidity of these instruments, so this technique will provide an overestimate of the equilibrium real rate.",2004-10-29
"I was reassured in my acceptance of Axel's invitation by David Laidler's survey paper, which found more successes than not over the past two decades.1 A concise summary of this success is evident in the performance of consumer price inflation in the advanced economies.",2007-09-21
Median inflation in that group (as defined by the International Monetary Fund) has held near 2 percent for this decade.,2007-09-21
"Indeed, in the IMF's latest World Economic Outlook, four out of five countries in this group are expected to post inflation rates between 1 percent and 3 percent this year.",2007-09-21
"That good performance has helped to anchor inflation expectations, which, in turn, generates many benefits.",2007-09-21
Anchored inflation expectations damp the pass-through of supply-related price shocks.,2007-09-21
"Most significantly, the improved inflation performance has come with, not at the expense of, output stability.",2007-09-21
"Although a consensus has not formed on how much of the ""Great Moderation"" in the growth of real output can be attributed to monetary policy, everyone agrees that at least a portion of it can.",2007-09-21
"The beliefs that David identifies are threefold: That market economies are inherently self-righting, that open economies perform best under flexible exchange rates, and that central bankers should focus on price stability as their long-run objective.",2007-09-21
David suggests that monetarism failed when its proponents got too prescriptive by advocating rigid rules for money growth.,2007-09-21
"As evidence of that humility on my part, let me also agree with David that two important questions about the conduct of monetary policy have not yet been resolved.",2007-09-21
"First, what is the best way to pursue price stability, and, second, how should asset prices be taken into account in steering policy?",2007-09-21
"In many countries, though not my own, the answer to the first question has been that price stability should be pursued through the formal apparatus of an inflation target, which typically includes establishing an inflation goal by the government, setting metrics to evaluate central bank performance, and periodically communicating progress to the public.",2007-09-21
"Although correlation does not convey causation, the spread of such regimes has coincided with sustained low global inflation.",2007-09-21
"In addition, no adopter of an inflation target has subsequently abandoned it.",2007-09-21
"Inflation has come down worldwide, in countries without, as well as with, inflation targets.",2007-09-21
"Moreover, I share David's puzzlement about why an explicit inflation goal should make a substantial difference in performance given the paucity of evidence showing that choosing a target directly affects the level of the public's inflation expectations.",2007-09-21
"That said, I am relatively more persuaded that inflation targeting helps reduce the variance of inflation expectations.",2007-09-21
"Evidence has accumulated to suggest that stock prices, interest rates, and measures of inflation expectations seem to vary less in economies in which the central bank has an explicit long-run goal for inflation.",2007-09-21
I suspect that this better anchoring of expectations and the success of inflation targeting in many countries is attributable in part to aspects of the political economy that David identified.,2007-09-21
"A formal inflation target represents a national embrace of a goal, in which elected authorities recognize the primacy of price stability and publicly support--indeed, even require--the central bank's pursuit of that goal.",2007-09-21
"To the extent that elected authorities channel the desires of the electorate, a central bank directed to adopt an inflation target is being given a strong signal as to the goal's importance to the public at large.",2007-09-21
An important effect of such public acceptance of price stability is that it erodes the standing of those who would direct central bank action toward other ends.,2007-09-21
"In most other instances, the adoption of an inflation target involved laws and mutual understandings, not constitutional changes.",2007-09-21
"The early adopters of inflation targets were parliamentary democracies, which is not too surprising given that in such a system a single branch of government can enact laws and put them into effect.",2007-09-21
"With regard to an inflation goal, the parliament can erect the formal apparatus and the finance minister can serve as the government's point of contact with the central bank.",2007-09-21
"Moreover, those two branches have already spoken as to the appropriate aim of the nation's central bank: The Congress, in a law the President signed, has given the Federal Reserve a dual mandate that directs us to foster maximum employment and stable prices over time.",2007-09-21
"Nor is this instruction unreasonable, in that the dual mandate has come to be interpreted as assigning us the responsibility for attaining price stability in the long run, which will bring with it maximum employment, and of being mindful of resource utilization in the succession of short runs that make up the long run.",2007-09-21
"The dual mandate seems proper and fitting, given that economic costs are incurred both by having inflation stray from its long-run goal and by having output deviate from the economy's potential to produce; and it seems to produce results not too different in practice from those associated with central banks that are flexible inflation targeters.",2007-09-21
"As I said earlier, anchoring expectations has value, in that it makes planning easier, reduces resources spent on predicting and protecting against unexpected variations in nominal magnitudes, and grants a central bank greater scope to lean against fluctuations in output while keeping inflation contained.",2007-09-21
"The latter is particularly attractive given our dual mandate, in that better-anchored inflation expectations could produce the win-win outcome of improving the attainment of both goals.",2007-09-21
"For that reason, in its consideration of its communications strategies, the Federal Open Market Committee has been discussing whether mechanisms could be put in place that could better anchor inflation expectations in a manner consistent with the institutional framework of our dual mandate.",2007-09-21
"The second of David's open issues--whether central banks should lean against possible asset price bubbles--was the key topic in my discussion here eighteen months ago, at Otmar's festschrift.",2007-09-21
A central bank should focus on the outlook for the macroeconomy and generally relegate asset prices to the subordinate role of inputs to the forecast process.,2007-09-21
"Second, even less confidence can be attached to predictions of the effects of policy on asset prices, and in particular on any speculative element in those prices.",2007-09-21
"Moreover, monetary policy actions addressed at a perceived bubble in one sector may have undesirable effects on other asset prices and the economy more generally.",2007-09-21
"As a result, my preferred policy framework remains three pronged: First, assign the single instrument of monetary policy to its macroeconomic objective; second, rely on regulation to erect a resilient financial structure; and, third, in the event that market judgments prove to be wrong and financial prices adjust sharply, apply the tool of monetary policy to the macroeconomic task at hand.",2007-09-21
"On the way down, investors' loss of confidence, a reduction in credit availability, and a tightening of terms and conditions for credit have the potential to have pronounced effects on activity and inflation.",2007-09-21
"I suspect that, when studies are done with cooler reflection, the causes of the swing in house prices will be seen as less a consequence of monetary policy and more a result of the emotions of excessive optimism followed by fear experienced every so often in the marketplace through the ages.",2007-09-21
Low policy interest rates early in this decade helped feed the initial rise in house prices.,2007-09-21
"And similar, sometimes even sharper, trajectories of house prices have been witnessed in some economies in which the central banks said they were paying more attention to asset prices.",2007-09-21
"The action the Federal Open Market Committee took this Tuesday can be interpreted as the application of the third leg of my preferred policy triad, in that it was taken ""to forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and promote moderate growth over time.""",2007-09-21
"In the past, such efforts to cushion the restraint induced by declines in asset prices have fueled the assertion that Federal Reserve policy is asymmetrical in its response to booms and busts in asset prices.",2007-09-21
"Such an asymmetry is said to have the potential to feed ""moral hazard"" in that investors would spend less effort evaluating underlying values as they were lulled by the protection they expected to be provided by monetary policy action.",2007-09-21
Asset prices have mattered in the determination of policy because they have mattered for our outlook.,2007-09-21
"I am confident that the federal funds rate would not have been as high in 2000 if it had not been for the level of equity prices that year, nor would the federal funds rate have been as elevated in 2006 in the absence of the tight credit spreads, low term premiums, and the impetus from housing wealth.",2007-09-21
And I doubt policy would have been eased this week if housing prices had continued their upward march.,2007-09-21
"In each instance, however, policy was motivated not by the desire to achieve any particular level of asset prices, but rather by the Federal Reserve's assessment of how changes in asset prices were affecting the forecast of growth and inflation.",2007-09-21
"In the typical boom-bust cycle, asset prices tend to rise relatively gradually over a protracted period but fall sharply in a shorter stretch of time, which financial economists refer to as ""rising by the escalator and falling by the elevator.""",2007-09-21
"Perhaps because those asset prices are important to spending, key macroeconomic indicators, such as the unemployment rate, exhibit a similar pattern.",2007-09-21
Inflation is much too high.,2022-02-21
Last year I noted that inflationary pressures associated with strong demand and constrained supply could take longer to subside than many expected.,2022-02-21
"Since then, those problems have persisted and inflation has broadened, reaching the highest rate that Americans have faced in forty years.",2022-02-21
"High inflation is a heavy burden for all Americans, but especially for those with limited means who are forced to pay more for everyday items, delay purchases, or put off saving for the future.",2022-02-21
"I intend to support prompt and decisive action to lower inflation, and today I will explain how the Fed is pursuing this goal.",2022-02-21
"In the near term, I expect that uncomfortably high inflation will persist at least through the first half of 2022.",2022-02-21
"We may see signs of inflation easing in the second half of the year, but there is a substantial risk that high inflation could persist.",2022-02-21
"In January, the Consumer Price Index rose to a 12-month rate of 7.5 percent, which, consistent with other recent monthly readings, was even higher than expected.",2022-02-21
"Employment costs for businesses, as measured by average hourly wages, also rose last month.",2022-02-21
And continued tightness in the labor market indicates that upward pressure on wages and other employment compensation is not likely to moderate soon.,2022-02-21
"My base case is that inflation will moderate later this year, which will depend, in part, on appropriate actions by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).",2022-02-21
"But with wage growth lagging behind inflation for the past year, many families may find it challenging to make ends meet and continued rising home prices will likely prevent many from entering the housing market.",2022-02-21
"I expect to see continued strength in the job market this year, with further gains in employment, and my hope is that more Americans return to the labor force and find work.",2022-02-21
The strength in job creation is a big positive for those seeking employment and for their families.,2022-02-21
"Even with the improving labor market, I still hear from businesses that qualified workers are difficult to find, and labor shortages remain a drag on hiring and on economic growth.",2022-02-21
Now let me turn to the implications of this outlook for monetary policy.,2022-02-21
"In my view, conditions in the labor market have been and are currently consistent with the FOMC's goal of maximum employment, and as such, my focus has been on the persistently high inflation.",2022-02-21
"In part, the high inflation reflects supply chain disruptions associated with the economic effects of the pandemic and efforts made to contain it.",2022-02-21
"Unfortunately, monetary policy isn't well-suited to address supply issues.",2022-02-21
"But strong demand and a very tight labor market have also contributed to inflation pressures, and the FOMC can help alleviate those pressures by removing the extraordinary monetary policy accommodation that is no longer needed.",2022-02-21
"In our most recent monetary policy statementâ€”which was released following our January meetingâ€”we indicated that ""with inflation well above 2 percent and a strong labor market,"" we expected that it would ""soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate.",2022-02-21
"""2 I fully supported that assessment, and the data we have seen since then have only increased the urgency to get on with the process of normalizing our interest rate stance and significantly reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.",2022-02-21
Returning the balance sheet to an appropriate and manageable level will be an important additional step toward addressing high inflation.,2022-02-21
"I expect that these steps will contribute to an easing in inflation pressures in the coming months, but further steps will likely be needed this year to tighten monetary policy.",2022-02-21
"Looking beyond this spring, my views on the appropriate pace of interest rate increases and balance sheet reduction for this year and beyond will depend on how the economy evolves.",2022-02-21
I will be particularly focused on how much progress we make on bringing down inflation.,2022-02-21
"My intent would be to take forceful action to help reduce inflation, bringing it back toward our 2 percent goal, while keeping the economy on track to continue creating jobs and economic opportunity for Americans.",2022-02-21
I appreciate the opportunity to share my views on monetary policy with you this morning.,2022-02-21

"August 26, 2022 Monetary Policy and Price Stability Chair Jerome H. Powell At â€œReassessing Constraints on the Economy and Policy,â€ an economic policy symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, Wyoming Share Watch Live Thank you for the opportunity to speak here today.",2022-08-26
"At past Jackson Hole conferences, I have discussed broad topics such as the ever-changing structure of the economy and the challenges of conducting monetary policy under high uncertainty.",2022-08-26
The Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) overarching focus right now is to bring inflation back down to our 2 percent goal.,2022-08-26
Price stability is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy.,2022-08-26
"Without price stability, the economy does not work for anyone.",2022-08-26
"In particular, without price stability, we will not achieve a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all.",2022-08-26
The burdens of high inflation fall heaviest on those who are least able to bear them.,2022-08-26
Restoring price stability will take some time and requires using our tools forcefully to bring demand and supply into better balance.,2022-08-26
Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth.,2022-08-26
"While higher interest rates, slower growth, and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses.",2022-08-26
These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation.,2022-08-26
But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain.,2022-08-26
"The U.S. economy is clearly slowing from the historically high growth rates of 2021, which reflected the reopening of the economy following the pandemic recession.",2022-08-26
"The labor market is particularly strong, but it is clearly out of balance, with demand for workers substantially exceeding the supply of available workers.",2022-08-26
"Inflation is running well above 2 percent, and high inflation has continued to spread through the economy.",2022-08-26
"While the lower inflation readings for July are welcome, a single month's improvement falls far short of what the Committee will need to see before we are confident that inflation is moving down.",2022-08-26
We are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent.,2022-08-26
"In current circumstances, with inflation running far above 2 percent and the labor market extremely tight, estimates of longer-run neutral are not a place to stop or pause.",2022-08-26
"At some point, as the stance of monetary policy tightens further, it likely will become appropriate to slow the pace of increases.",2022-08-26
Restoring price stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive policy stance for some time.,2022-08-26
"Our monetary policy deliberations and decisions build on what we have learned about inflation dynamics both from the high and volatile inflation of the 1970s and 1980s, and from the low and stable inflation of the past quarter-century.",2022-08-26
The first lesson is that central banks can and should take responsibility for delivering low and stable inflation.,2022-08-26
"It may seem strange now that central bankers and others once needed convincing on these two fronts, but as former Chairman Ben Bernanke has shown, both propositions were widely questioned during the Great Inflation period.1 Today, we regard these questions as settled.",2022-08-26
Our responsibility to deliver price stability is unconditional.,2022-08-26
"It is true that the current high inflation is a global phenomenon, and that many economies around the world face inflation as high or higher than seen here in the United States.",2022-08-26
"It is also true, in my view, that the current high inflation in the United States is the product of strong demand and constrained supply, and that the Fed's tools work principally on aggregate demand.",2022-08-26
None of this diminishes the Federal Reserve's responsibility to carry out our assigned task of achieving price stability.,2022-08-26
There is clearly a job to do in moderating demand to better align with supply.,2022-08-26
The second lesson is that the public's expectations about future inflation can play an important role in setting the path of inflation over time.,2022-08-26
"Today, by many measures, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well anchored.",2022-08-26
"But that is not grounds for complacency, with inflation having run well above our goal for some time.",2022-08-26
"If the public expects that inflation will remain low and stable over time, then, absent major shocks, it likely will.",2022-08-26
"Unfortunately, the same is true of expectations of high and volatile inflation.",2022-08-26
"During the 1970s, as inflation climbed, the anticipation of high inflation became entrenched in the economic decisionmaking of households and businesses.",2022-08-26
"The more inflation rose, the more people came to expect it to remain high, and they built that belief into wage and pricing decisions.",2022-08-26
"As former Chairman Paul Volcker put it at the height of the Great Inflation in 1979, ""Inflation feeds in part on itself, so part of the job of returning to a more stable and more productive economy must be to break the grip of inflationary expectations.",2022-08-26
"""2 One useful insight into how actual inflation may affect expectations about its future path is based in the concept of ""rational inattention.",2022-08-26
"""3 When inflation is persistently high, households and businesses must pay close attention and incorporate inflation into their economic decisions.",2022-08-26
"When inflation is low and stable, they are freer to focus their attention elsewhere.",2022-08-26
"Former Chairman Alan Greenspan put it this way: ""For all practical purposes, price stability means that expected changes in the average price level are small enough and gradual enough that they do not materially enter business and household financial decisions.",2022-08-26
"""4 Of course, inflation has just about everyone's attention right now, which highlights a particular risk today: The longer the current bout of high inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become entrenched.",2022-08-26
"History shows that the employment costs of bringing down inflation are likely to increase with delay, as high inflation becomes more entrenched in wage and price setting.",2022-08-26
The successful Volcker disinflation in the early 1980s followed multiple failed attempts to lower inflation over the previous 15 years.,2022-08-26
A lengthy period of very restrictive monetary policy was ultimately needed to stem the high inflation and start the process of getting inflation down to the low and stable levels that were the norm until the spring of last year.,2022-08-26
These lessons are guiding us as we use our tools to bring inflation down.,2022-08-26
"We are taking forceful and rapid steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better alignment with supply, and to keep inflation expectations anchored.",2022-08-26

"November 08, 2021 Flexible Average Inflation Targeting and Prospects for U.S. Monetary Policy Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the Symposium on Monetary Policy Frameworks, The Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share Watch Live Outlooks and Outcomes for the U.S. Economy The U.S. economy in the second quarter of this year made the transition from economic recovery to economic expansion.1 Given the catastrophic collapse in U.S. economic activity in the first half of 2020 as a result of the global pandemic and the mitigation efforts put in place to contain it, few forecasters could have expectedâ€”or even dared to hopeâ€”in the spring of last year that the recovery in gross domestic product (GDP), from the sharpest decline in activity since the Great Depression, would be either so robust or as rapid.",2021-11-08
"Indeed, the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating Committee determined in July that the recession that began in March of last year ended in April, making it not only the deepest recession on record, but also the briefest.2 The recovery that commenced in the summer of 2020 was quite robust, and, with one quarter to go, GDP growth in 2021 is projected by the Fed and many outside forecasters to be the fastest since 1983.",2021-11-08
"That said, under the median projection for GDP growth in the September Summary of Economic projections, the level of real GDP will have returned to its pre pandemic trend growth trajectory by the fourth quarter of 2021, which if realized would represent one of the most rapid such recoveries in 50 years.3 In the September SEP round, my individual projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the policy rate path turned out to be quite close to the path of SEP medians for each of these variables over the 2021â€“24 projection window.",2021-11-08
"Under these projections, GDP growth steps down from 5.9 percent this year to 3.8 percent in 2022 and further to 2.5 percent and 2 percent in 2023 and 2024, respectively.",2021-11-08
"Not surprisingly, the projected path of above-trend GDP growth in 2021 and 2022 translates into rapid declines in the projected path for the unemployment rate, which is projected to fall to 3.8 percent by the end of 2022 and 3.5 percent by the end of 2023.",2021-11-08
"This modal projection for the path of the unemployment rate is, according to the Atlanta Fed jobs calculator, consistent with a rebound in labor force participation to its estimated demographic trend and is also consistent with cumulative employment gains this year and next that, by the end of 2022, eliminate the 4.2 million ""employment gap"" relative to the previous cycle peak.4 My projections for headline and core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation are, alas, also similar to the median SEP numbers.",2021-11-08
"Under the projected SEP path for inflation, core PCE inflation surges to at least 3.7 percent this year before reverting back to 2.3 percent in 2022, 2.2 percent in 2023, and 2.1 percent in 2024.",2021-11-08
"Thus, the baseline outlook for inflation over the three-year projection window reflects the judgment, shared with many outside forecasters, that under appropriate monetary policy, most of the inflation overshoot relative to the longer-run goal of 2 percent will, in the end, prove to be transitory.",2021-11-08
"Although in a number of sectors of the economy the imbalances between demand and supplyâ€”including labor supplyâ€”are substantial, I do continue to judge that these imbalances are likely to dissipate over time as the labor market and global supply chains eventually adjust and, importantly, do so without putting persistent upward pressure on price inflation and wage gains adjusted for productivity.",2021-11-08
"First, realized PCE inflation so far this year represents, to me, much more than a ""moderate"" overshoot of our 2 percent longer-run inflation objective, and I would not consider a repeat performance next year a policy success.",2021-11-08
"Second, as always, there are risks to any outlook, and I and 12 of my colleagues believe that the risks to the outlook for inflation are to the upside.",2021-11-08
"Prospects for U.S. Monetary Policy In September 2020, the FOMC introducedâ€”and since then has reaffirmedâ€”outcome-based, threshold guidance that specifies three conditions that the Committee expects will be met before it considers increasing the target range for the federal funds rate, currently 0 to 25 basis points.5 This guidance in September of last year brought the forward guidance on the federal funds rate in the statement into alignment with the new flexible average inflation targeting framework adopted in August 2020.6 To quote from the statement, these conditions are that ""labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.""",2021-11-08
"While we are clearly a ways away from considering raising interest rates, if the outlooks for inflation and unemployment I summarized a moment ago turn out to be the actual outcomes realized over the forecast horizon, then I believe that these three necessary conditions for raising the target range for the federal funds rate will have been met by year-end 2022.7 Core PCE inflation since February 2020â€”a calculation window that smooths out any base effects resulting from ""round trip"" declines and rebounds in the price levels of COVID-19-sensitive sectors and, coincidentally, also measures the average rate of core PCE inflation since hitting the effective lower bound (ELB) in March 2020â€”is running at 2.8 percent through September 2021 and is projected to remain moderately above 2 percent in all three years of the projection window.",2021-11-08
"Moreover, my inflation projections for 2023 and 2024, which forecast inflation rates similar to the SEP medians, would by year-end 2022, to me, satisfy the ""on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time"" threshold specified in the statement.",2021-11-08
"Finally, while my assessment of maximum employment incorporates a wide range of indicators to assess the state of the labor marketâ€”including indicators of labor compensation, productivity, and price-cost markupsâ€”the employment data I look at, such as the Kansas City Fed's Labor Market Conditions Indicators, are historically highly correlated with the unemployment rate.8 My expectation today is that the labor market by the end of 2022 will have reached my assessment of maximum employment if the unemployment rate has declined by then to the SEP median of modal projections of 3.8 percent.",2021-11-08
"Given this economic outlook and so long as inflation expectations remain well anchored at the 2 percent longer-run goalâ€”which, based on the Fed staff's common inflation expectations (CIE) index, I judge at present to be the caseâ€”a policy normalization path similar to the median SEP dot plot on page 4 of our September 2021 projections would, under these conditions, be entirely consistent, to me, with our new flexible average inflation targeting framework and the policy rate reaction function I discussed in remarks here at Brookings in November 2020.9 In the context of our new framework, it is important to note that while the ELB can be a constraint on monetary policy, the ELB is not a constraint on fiscal policy, and appropriate monetary policy under our new framework, to me, mustâ€”and certainly canâ€”incorporate this reality.",2021-11-08
"Indeed, under present circumstances, I judge that the support to aggregate demand from fiscal policyâ€”including the roughly $2 trillion in accumulated excess savings accruing from (as yet) unspent transfer paymentsâ€”in tandem with appropriate monetary policy, can fully offset the constraint, highlighted in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, that the ELB imposes on the ability of inflation-targeting monetary policy, acting on its own and in the absence of sufficient fiscal support, to restore, following a recession, maximum employment and price stability while keeping inflation expectations well anchored at the 2 percent longer-run goal.10 Before I conclude, let me say a few words about our Treasury and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) purchase programs.",2021-11-08
"In our December 2020 FOMC statement, we indicated that we would maintain the pace of Treasury and MBS purchases at $80 billion and $40 billion per month, respectively, until ""substantial further progress"" has been made toward our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.",2021-11-08
"In my remarks, I will offer a bridge from today's discussion of structural changes to the implications for monetary policy, the subject of tomorrow's agenda.",2000-03-03
"In my view, the most important challenges to monetary policy related to structural change in this episode arise from possible changes in aggregate supply--specifically in the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) and in trend growth.",2000-03-03
"The key challenge for monetary policymakers during this period, in my view, has been to allow the economy to realize the full benefits of the new possibilities while avoiding an overheated economy.",2000-03-03
"More fundamentally, the challenge has been to adapt the strategy of monetary policy in light of the uncertainties associated with structural change.",2000-03-03
"However, the key structural change during this episode--an increase in the underlying productivity growth trend--has also set in motion a complex of effects on inflation, interest rates, equity prices, and aggregate demand.",2000-03-03
"Even if we knew the precise value of the higher productivity trend, we would likely remain uncertain about the size and persistence of many of its effects.",2000-03-03
"As a result, adapting monetary policy to a higher trend rate of productivity growth would be a challenge, especially in an interest-rate setting regime, even if there were no uncertainty about the new underlying growth trend.",2000-03-03
"Perspectives on Monetary Policy Strategy There are, in my view, two fundamental requirements of a prudent monetary policy.",2000-03-03
"First, monetary policy should impose a nominal anchor, pinning down the long-run inflation rate.",2000-03-03
"Second, monetary policy should lean against the cyclical winds.",2000-03-03
The second requirement contributes to the first and also to smoothing fluctuations in output around full employment.,2000-03-03
This view of the mission of monetary policy is consistent with both the dual mandate for the Federal Reserve in the Federal Reserve Act and with flexible inflation targeting regimes in many countries.,2000-03-03
The key to the practice of monetary policy is to develop a strategy for the discretionary conduct of policy that meets these requirements.,2000-03-03
"But perhaps equally important, John's approach has encouraged a wider acceptance of the study of rules by emphasizing that the objective is to inform discretionary monetary policy decisions rather than to replace discretion by a rule.",2000-03-03
I find the Taylor rule attractive because it is closely aligned both with the objectives of monetary policy and with the model that governs inflation dynamics.,2000-03-03
"That is, the rule responds directly to deviations from the Federal Reserve's objectives--price stability and an equilibrium utilization rate.",2000-03-03
And it incorporates a preemptive response to inflation that is consistent with models that assign an important role to unemployment or output gaps in inflation dynamics.,2000-03-03
"However, implementing this strategy requires knowledge of the output gap and the equilibrium real interest rate--variables that appear to have been affected by structural change.",2000-03-03
"Uncertainty and Monetary Policy Strategy Given uncertainty about the output gap, for example, should we attenuate the response to the output gap or even entirely abandon the output gap as a guide to adjustment in monetary policy?",2000-03-03
"If we are less preemptive, should we compensate by being more aggressively reactive to recent inflation?",2000-03-03
"For example, would we minimize the damage from mis-estimates of the NAIRU and trend growth using a nominal income rule instead of a Taylor rule?",2000-03-03
Or should we allow for a nonlinear instead of a linear policy response to movements in output and inflation?,2000-03-03
"For example, by examining the historical record at the Federal Reserve, Athanasios Orphanides uncovered substantial and persistent measurement error associated with estimates of the output gap--one of the measures we sometimes identify with ""excess demand.""",2000-03-03
"Suppose, as in Swanson's work, that inflation depends on an unobservable variable we call ""excess demand"" and policy responds to the unemployment rate, which is only an imperfect indicator of ""excess demand.""",2000-03-03
"Since the unemployment rate is a noisy indicator of what the policymaker is interested in--the unobservable ""excess demand""--the weight the policymaker will give this variable will vary with its reliability as an indicator for excess demand.",2000-03-03
"In the current context, that means that the weight on the unemployment rate is decreased, while the weight on inflation is increased.",2000-03-03
"In effect, as policy becomes less preemptive in stabilizing inflation, it becomes more aggressive in reacting to recent inflation.",2000-03-03
"In contrast with the conclusions based on signal extraction models, the simulations results using simple rules generally finds that increased uncertainty about the output gap may call for attenuation in the response to both the gap variable and inflation.",2000-03-03
"In Swanson's work, for example, optimal policy still displays certainty equivalence when policy is related to the unobservable excess demand.",2000-03-03
"In the paper that Svensson and Woodford will present tomorrow, where the model relates inflation directly to the observed unemployment gap, certainty equivalence holds provided that the estimate of the gap is updated on the basis of all available data and the true model.",2000-03-03
"This question appears particularly relevant to the uncertainties that monetary policymakers are wrestling with today, and I am sure we will have a lot of discussion about this conclusion tomorrow.",2000-03-03
"First, I believe part of the challenge today is finding a proxy for the unobservable excess demand, especially given the divergent movements in the unemployment and capacity utilization rates.",2000-03-03
"Therefore, in my view, Swanson's conclusion that certainty equivalence holds when policy is expressed in terms of the unobservable ""excess demand"" is dominated by his conclusion that attenuation holds when policy is made in terms of observables.",2000-03-03
"First, policymakers should continuously update their estimates of the NAIRU and the output gap, using all available information, particularly the realizations of unemployment, output, and inflation.",2000-03-03
"Specifically, policymakers should attenuate their response to movements in the unemployment or output gap.",2000-03-03
"Third, the literature is less clear about whether policymakers should offset any attenuation in the response to the output gap with a more aggressive response to movements in realized inflation.",2000-03-03
"Taking the second and third conclusions together, the relative weights on the gap variable and inflation should vary, depending on the degree of uncertainty about the output gap.",2000-03-03
The higher coefficient on the inflation rate might be justified by the fact that inflation has become a better indicator of the excess demand compared with the output gap when there is heightened uncertainty about the measurement of the output gap.,2000-03-03
"The focus of the literature has been on uncertainty about the unemployment or output gap, but a shift in trend productivity growth also results in uncertainty about the equilibrium real interest rate.",2000-03-03
I have suggested a nonlinear rule that would attenuate the response to the unemployment rate in a region around the best estimate of the NAIRU but would cause a gradual return to the more aggressive marginal response appropriate under certainty equivalence once the unemployment rate had moved sufficiently below the best estimate of the NAIRU.,2000-03-03
"For example, to the extent that the effect on inflation becomes disproportionately larger as the unemployment or output gap increases, the policy response should become more aggressive with each incremental increase in the gap.",2000-03-03
"For example, policymakers might have a prior of 5 percent for the NAIRU, but a uniform probability distribution over the range between 4 ½ percent and 5 ½ percent for the unemployment rate.",2000-03-03
"Because policymakers are so uncertain about the NAIRU within this interval, they might be very willing to revise their estimate of the NAIRU about in line with the observations of the unemployment rate within it.",2000-03-03
"As a result, movements of the unemployment rate within this range would have little effect on the estimate of the unemployment gap and, therefore, on the target interest rate.",2000-03-03
"However, if the unemployment rate moved outside this range, policymakers might assign an increasingly smaller fraction of each increment of the unemployment rate to the NAIRU as the unemployment rate moved still further from policymakers' best estimate of the NAIRU.",2000-03-03
Monetary Policy's Adjustment to Uncertainty about Key Parameters Is the recent monetary policy response consistent with the lessons I have drawn from the literature on uncertainty associated with noisy observations?,2000-03-03
It seems to me that initially monetary policy was consistent with a backward-looking Taylor rule (although that is sometimes difficult to distinguish from a forward-looking Taylor rule).,2000-03-03
We were faced with two surprises: faster-than-expected growth (resulting in a higher-than-expected estimated output gap) and lower-than-expected inflation.,2000-03-03
"These had offsetting effects on the nominal funds rate, yielding a nearly unchanged policy until the fall of 1998 and a policy that closely tracked the Taylor rule prescription, at least allowing for updates of the estimated unemployment or output gaps along the way.",2000-03-03
"As the episode progressed, more questions were raised--both inside and outside the Federal Reserve--about the values of the NAIRU and trend growth.",2000-03-03
"In the fall of 1998, monetary policy responded both to the financial market distress and to the abrupt change in the forecast for growth (and hence utilization rates) in the United States.",2000-03-03
"Once it became apparent that the U.S. economy was maintaining its momentum despite weaker foreign growth and that financial markets had returned toward normal, the growing uncertainty about the output gap--reflecting the continuing contradiction of declining inflation and rising output gaps--made monetary policymakers cautious about aggressively reversing their policy actions.",2000-03-03
"In effect, policymakers could be interpreted as attenuating their response to the unemployment and output gap in line with the theoretical models and empirical results I have talked about.",2000-03-03
"Beginning in mid-1999, with the estimated output gap increasing further and growth shifting to a still-higher gear, policymakers became more concerned about the possibility of overheating and, hence, the risks of higher inflation.",2000-03-03
"Of course, every policy action needs to be defended in terms of its contribution in the future to achieving the objectives of monetary policy.",2000-03-03
"In this spirit, I interpreted the tightening moves as preemptive attempts to limit inflation risks.",2000-03-03
"Why did policymakers tolerate for a while further increases in the output gap, and why did they subsequently become more concerned about the inflation risks from further increases in the output gap?",2000-03-03
"As the unemployment rate fell farther below the best estimates of the NAIRU and the risk of overheating increased, policymakers became less tolerant of continued above-trend growth.",2000-03-03
"Monetary Policy Strategy in Light of the Uncertainties Associated with Structural Change Looking backward, I think we can find at least a hint of attenuation of the response to changes in the unemployment rate and, more recently, a hint of a nonlinear policy response.",2000-03-03
What does this suggest about monetary policy strategy going forward?,2000-03-03
"The first step is, preemptively, to slow growth to trend.",2000-03-03
"The second step is to respond reactively to higher inflation, should the prevailing output gap prove to be inconsistent with stable inflation.",2000-03-03
"In my judgment, the unemployment rate has already declined to a sufficiently low level relative to my estimate of the NAIRU that we should no longer be attenuating the marginal policy response to further declines.",2000-03-03
"But the current policy is, in my view, also an aggressive version of such a strategy because it is not a nonlinear response to further declines in the unemployment rate, but a forward-looking attempt to prevent further tightening of the labor market.",2000-03-03
"Once growth has slowed to trend and the output gap stabilizes, monetary policy may become more reactive, given the continued uncertainty about the levels of the NAIRU and the output gap.",2000-03-03
"That is, policymakers might be prepared to slow the economy to trend growth to avoid the risk of higher inflation associated with still-lower unemployment rates and higher output gaps, but might be reluctant to reduce the perceived output gap without evidence from realized inflation that the prevailing gap is unsustainable.",2000-03-03
"Under such a policy, the response to inflation should, in my view, be more aggressive than it would otherwise be, for example, in the Taylor rule under certainty.",2000-03-03
This is an example of offsetting the attenuation in the response to the output gap with a more aggressive response to inflation realizations.,2000-03-03
"In effect, the policy setting at trend growth and at the prevailing level of the output gap is presumed to be consistent with stable inflation.",2000-03-03
An increase in inflation (specifically in core inflation) would be evidence that the output gap is not in fact sustainable.,2000-03-03
"As a result, the increase in interest rates should be the combined response to a slight increase in the estimate of the NAIRU and to an increase in the inflation rate at an unchanged estimate of the NAIRU.",2000-03-03
"For example, let us assume that growth ultimately moves to trend but, in the interim, the continued above-trend growth increases the output gap still further.",2000-03-03
"In response, policy should tighten incrementally, encouraging below trend-growth and hence unwinding the further increase in the output gap.",2000-03-03
"However, it does risk allowing excess demand to build until it shows up in inflation and may ultimately require a more aggressive response of interest rates, if the range of attenuation does not in fact correspond to a decline in the NAIRU.",2000-03-03
Conclusion Structural change complicates the task of monetary policy.,2000-03-03
"Of course, it is not difficult to put up with this additional burden when the structural change takes the form of a decline in the NAIRU and an increase in trend productivity growth.",2000-03-03
It would not be easy for monetary policy to turn such good fortune into poor macroeconomic performance.,2000-03-03
But the uncertainties about the nature and degree of structural change confront policymakers with the task of striving to realize the benefits of a decline in the NAIRU and an increase in trend growth while trying to avoid the inflationary consequences of overtaxing the new limits.,2000-03-03
Recent work on signal extraction models and on the implications of noisy observations provides some important guidance about how to adjust the strategy of monetary policy in the face of the new uncertainties.,2000-03-03
"This conference provides a timely opportunity to assess what we have learned and how it might be applied to monetary policy today, as well as to point to areas that may deserve further exploration.",2000-03-03

Economic growth has been proceeding at a rate that is close to double what was generally viewed as the long-term trend when this expansion began.,2000-01-20
"Inflation remains modest, despite a decline in the unemployment rate to levels that many would have expected to trigger a significant acceleration in prices.",2000-01-20
"The fundamental question today, it seems to me, is whether the current set of macroeconomic conditions--specifically, the growth of output and the unemployment rate--is sustainable--that is, consistent with stable, low inflation.",2000-01-20
"Otherwise, the challenge for monetary policy is to guide the economy to a sustainable path while preserving low inflation.",2000-01-20
"This challenge is heightened by the unusual degree of uncertainty about the limits of capacity and potential growth, related in part to ongoing structural changes in the economy.",2000-01-20
"Concerns have also been raised about potential imbalances in some sectors, for example, about the sustainability of equity prices, the personal saving rate, the current account deficit, and debt burdens.",2000-01-20
These concerns about sustainability and the challenges they pose for monetary policy are the focus of my remarks this afternoon.,2000-01-20
"Varieties of Landings In figure 1, I present four plausible scenarios for future growth.",2000-01-20
"During the expansion phase, at least for a period, growth in production typically exceeds the growth in capacity, so that the gap between actual and potential output is closed gradually.",2000-01-20
"For the moment, I shall focus exclusively on the concerns about sustainability related to the balance between aggregate supply and demand.",2000-01-20
"Later I shall turn to concerns about imbalances in equity prices, the personal saving rate, the current account, and the household debt burden.",2000-01-20
"A Soft Landing Figure 1.A depicts a soft landing scenario, the graceful transition from the initial output gap to a sustainable growth path at full employment.",2000-01-20
"A soft landing occurs if, as the level of output approaches potential, the growth of actual output slows to the growth of potential output just as actual output reaches potential.",2000-01-20
Steady inflation is generally one of the signs of sustainability.,2000-01-20
"A simple model of inflation dynamics is that changes in inflation are induced by excess aggregate demand or supply, as reflected in the output gap.",2000-01-20
"When actual output rises above potential, according to this model, the resulting excess aggregate demand leads to rising inflation.",2000-01-20
"In the short run, supply shocks--including both relative price shocks and changes in trend productivity--can also affect inflation dynamics.",2000-01-20
"Ultimately, inflation dynamics will be driven by the output gap.",2000-01-20
"Such a slowdown in growth is desirable because the alternative is higher inflation--indeed, continually rising inflation.",2000-01-20
"Looking back, most recessions have resulted from attempts by the policy authorities--yes, the Fed--to reverse increases in inflation generated by overheating.",2000-01-20
A Reverse Soft Landing Figure 1.B depicts an alternative scenario in which the above-trend growth in the expansion phase has moved the economy beyond the point of its sustainable capacity to produce.,2000-01-20
"In this case, because the economy is already operating beyond its sustainable capacity, the economy may not be able to avoid some acceleration in inflation as policymakers try to engineer the soft landing.",2000-01-20
"Therefore, the return to the potential output path has to be achieved in a sufficiently timely fashion to minimize any increase in inflation during the transition.",2000-01-20
"Also, in the reverse soft landing case, growth must slow, not just to trend but to below trend in order to close the output gap.",2000-01-20
"As a result, the unemployment rate must rise during the transition to full employment in this case.",2000-01-20
"Hence, whereas the soft landing outcome in figure 1.A involves a stabilization of the unemployment rate at its low point and of inflation near its recent low, in the reverse soft landing case depicted in figure 1.B, both inflation and unemployment rates are likely to rise during the transition.",2000-01-20
The Best-Case Scenario: Supply Meets Demand The first two scenarios I have described assume that demand has to adjust to a steady supply path to achieve sustainability.,2000-01-20
"There are natural equilibrating mechanisms, as well as policy adjustments, that encourage such adjustment in demand relative to supply.",2000-01-20
An alternative scenario is that supply adjusts to demand.,2000-01-20
This case is depicted in figure 1.C in which the growth of potential increases just as output threatens to push beyond potential.,2000-01-20
"If this scenario describes the current episode, then the economy can continue to grow at 4 percent, the unemployment rate can remain near 4 percent, and inflation can remain steady at its prevailing rate.",2000-01-20
"But it has the advantage of incorporating the role of supply-side as well as demand-side forces that appear to be at work in this expansion, and it would at least help explain the stability of inflation at prevailing growth and unemployment rates.",2000-01-20
"Indeed, a possible decline in the NAIRU and, especially, an increase in the growth rate of potential output appear to be essential elements of this expansion.",2000-01-20
"Still, even if we take into account the supply-side changes, we should not expect a perfect balancing between supply and demand.",2000-01-20
"The upside of a hard landing is that it contributes to reversing imbalances and, afterwards, allows policymakers to aim once again at achieving a healthy, sustainable expansion, ultimately combining full employment, maximum sustainable growth, and price stability.",2000-01-20
The first involves the reversal of an imbalance between aggregate supply and aggregate demand.,2000-01-20
I will focus first on the boom-bust scenario to complete my classification of paths to sustainable combinations of growth and the output gap.,2000-01-20
"In the boom-bust scenario, depicted in figure 1.D, above-trend output growth during the expansion ultimately pushes output well beyond potential for a persistent period.",2000-01-20
The resulting overheating puts upward pressure on inflation.,2000-01-20
"The monetary policy response to reverse the inflation often yields a decline in output, as depicted here, resulting in a period of economic slack and a reversal of the rise in inflation.",2000-01-20
"This is the scenario from which we draw the lesson that timely, typically preemptive, policy restraint to avoid the excesses of a boom results in longer expansions and avoids unnecessary fluctuations in both output and inflation.",2000-01-20
"To identify whether the initial conditions today correspond to those in one of the panels of figure 1, we have to assess where output is relative to its potential and whether growth is above or below trend.",2000-01-20
This assignment is more difficult than usual because structural changes of uncertain dimension may have raised both the level and the growth rate of potential output.,2000-01-20
There is also a consensus that the rate of growth of potential output is higher today than during the twenty years preceding this expansion.,2000-01-20
"In particular, some think that the rapid growth and low unemployment rate of the past two years represent the economy's new equilibrium (case 1.C), but others believe that the economy has still been running ahead of potential recently, despite structural changes.",2000-01-20
"We should not be surprised that a period of structural change would also be one of heightened uncertainty about key parameters, such as the NAIRU and trend growth.",2000-01-20
"Table 1 offers various estimates of the NAIRU and trend growth, drawn from researchers, model-based forecasts, assumptions incorporated in government budget projections, and surveys of economic forecasters.",2000-01-20
These estimates suggest that actual output is above potential (the unemployment rate is below the NAIRU) and that actual output growth has been above trend growth of potential.,2000-01-20
"Despite the uncertainties, the consensus estimates of the NAIRU and the growth of potential give us a hint about what type of landing we should be aiming for and which of the scenarios depicted in figure 1 best describe the economy's initial conditions and prospects.",2000-01-20
"That is, even after we incorporate the estimated decline in the NAIRU and the higher rate of growth of potential (as reflected in figure 1.C), output is above potential and output growth exceeds that of potential (as depicted in figures 1.B and 1.D).",2000-01-20
"To complete the picture, we also have to rely on the temporary disinflationary effects of favorable relative-price shocks and the increase in the productivity trend that have allowed the economy to operate, for a while, beyond potential without suffering inflationary consequences.",2000-01-20
"Hard Landings Associated with the Unwinding of Sector and Market Imbalances Much of the recent concern about the sustainability of this expansion is, nevertheless, not related directly to the balance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply.",2000-01-20
"Most notably, attention has focused on equity prices, the personal saving rate, the current account deficit, and debt burdens.",2000-01-20
"Minsky emphasized the role of vulnerabilities arising from financial imbalances, including excessive debt burdens or increases in the price of risky assets relative to safe assets.",2000-01-20
"Historical Perspective on Market or Sector Imbalances Figure 2 offers a historical perspective on equity prices, the personal saving rate, the current account, and debt burden.",2000-01-20
"The chart for the stock market, figure 2.A, shows the price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P500 index, based on the trailing four-quarter earnings.",2000-01-20
Common Sources of Recent Developments What I do want to focus on this afternoon are possible common sources for the developments pictured in figure 2 and the relation of any imbalance between aggregate supply and demand to those developments.,2000-01-20
"During expansions, equity prices tend to rise, although they often decline before a downturn in the economy.",2000-01-20
"The unemployment rate, for example, has declined to a 30-year low.",2000-01-20
"Private domestic demand typically is the driver of expansions, but its contribution has been even greater than usual this time.",2000-01-20
"The direct contribution of federal government spending and tax changes, reflected in the swing in the federal budget from deficit to surplus, has been a net drag on growth.",2000-01-20
So the pace of domestic private demand has been even stronger than the growth in overall output.,2000-01-20
"Private domestic spending has been driven, in part, by the wealth effect arising from higher equity prices, a situation that also helps to explain much of the decline in the personal saving rate, and has been financed by a higher household debt and by the tapping of foreign saving.",2000-01-20
Also the two types of imbalances--an imbalance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply and sector or market imbalances--could be connected.,2000-01-20
Consider a situation in which growth is above trend and output moves beyond capacity.,2000-01-20
"If investors misread these developments as sustainable and, therefore, extrapolate the exceptional conditions, exceptional and perhaps unsustainable movements in equity prices, the saving rate, and debt burden might be encouraged.",2000-01-20
"Alternatively, a rise in equity prices that outstrips fundamentals might contribute to a pace of private domestic demand that ultimately takes output beyond capacity; in this case, the market or sector imbalance would be what contributed to the aggregate demand-supply imbalance.",2000-01-20
"Finally, market or sector imbalances could possibly rise to worrisome proportions in the absence of an imbalance between aggregate demand and supply.",2000-01-20
This analysis leaves us with four possible combinations: (1) simultaneous imbalances in both aggregate demand/supply and market/sector variables; (2) simultaneous balance in each class; (3) aggregate demand/supply imbalance accompanied by balance in market/sector variables; and (4) aggregate demand/supply balance accompanied by market/sector imbalances.,2000-01-20
"A decline in the stock market might also, for example, reduce confidence in the U.S. economy and reduce the willingness of foreigners to accumulate the increment in U.S. liabilities associated with the current account deficit.",2000-01-20
"As a result of these considerations, simple multiplier exercises, such as the effect on the economy of a given percentage decline in equity prices, probably tell more about the econometric model used than about prospects for the economy.",2000-01-20
"The Challenge for Monetary Policy The most important of the perceived imbalances I have discussed today is, in my view, the possibility of an overheated economy.",2000-01-20
"In three of the four combinations of aggregate demand/supply and market/sector imbalances, it seems to me that the best approach would be to focus directly on the aggregate demand/supply imbalance and allow the indirect effects of such a policy to mitigate any other imbalances.",2000-01-20
"In addition, any other imbalances are more likely to grow to worrisome proportions during an unsustainable boom and are more likely to unwind in a disruptive manner if confronted by rising inflation, sharply higher interest rates in response to higher inflation, and a subsequent recession.",2000-01-20
That leaves the possibility that there might be cases when we face market/sector imbalances in the absence of any aggregate demand/supply imbalance.,2000-01-20
"In such a case, the level and growth of output are sustainable in the sense that they are not putting pressure on inflation; but this aggregate balance might be threatened subsequently by a spontaneous unwinding of a market/sector imbalance.",2000-01-20
What role can and should monetary policy play in such a case?,2000-01-20
"Furthermore, it is not obvious how to unwind an excessive debt burden, to raise the personal saving rate, or to narrow the current account deficit in a sustainable way through monetary policy.",2000-01-20
"As a result, monetary policy, in my view, needs to focus on achieving balance between aggregate supply and aggregate demand.",2000-01-20
"In pursuing this course, monetary policy is confronted by two competing challenges.",2000-01-20
The first is to allow the economy to realize the benefits of any decline in the NAIRU and any increase in trend growth.,2000-01-20
Supporting maximum sustainable growth is very much the business of monetary policy.,2000-01-20
But achieving maximum sustainable growth also is about ensuring the sustainability of an expansion and hence avoiding overheating.,2000-01-20
"I focus on the change in the consensus forecast because, in my judgment, it is the revision in the outlook for 1999 in response to recent developments in the global economy and domestic financial markets that justified the recent easing of monetary policy.",1998-10-05
Then I will conclude with a discussion of the implications of the outlook for monetary policy.,1998-10-05
"The key here is to explain the rapid change in the posture of monetary policy--from a stance of asymmetric toward tightening just a few months ago, to symmetric, and then to an easing.",1998-10-05
Let me emphasize that the views on the economic outlook and monetary policy I present this morning are my own.,1998-10-05
"The bottom line is that you forecast a benign slowdown that unwinds some of the tightness in labor markets, while sustaining growth and maintaining modest inflation.",1998-10-05
Your forecast also presumes a flexible monetary policy that responds to changing conditions and effectively promotes such an outcome.,1998-10-05
"Judging from the path of the Treasury bill rate, the Blue Chip forecast assumed no change in monetary policy through 1999.",1998-10-05
"So, the NABE forecast was slightly weaker, but just offset by its assumption of a policy easing, leaving the forecasts for growth over 1999 identical in both cases.",1998-10-05
"More likely, it reflects the fact that during this period, there have also been continuing upside surprises with respect to domestic demand.",1998-10-05
"As a result, the upward revisions to the forecast for domestic demand may have just offset downward revisions to the forecast for net exports.",1998-10-05
"More recently, it also appears to reflect your confidence in monetary policy, a theme that I will return to later.",1998-10-05
A soft landing is achieved if growth slows to trend just as the economy converges to potential output.,1998-10-05
"In this case, growth has to slow to a below-trend rate until actual output again converges to potential, at which point growth returns to and remains at trend.",1998-10-05
"The characterization of the forecast as a reverse soft landing hinges on the interpretation that the unemployment rate is initially below NAIRU and that growth slows below trend going forward, allowing the transition back toward NAIRU.",1998-10-05
"While this is consistent with your estimates of NAIRU and trend growth, I was, nevertheless, surprised that your estimate of NAURU was as low as it was, 4.9%, and that your estimate of trend growth, 2.7%, was as high as it was.",1998-10-05
The qualitative features of the reverse soft landing scenario in your forecast are slowing growth and rising inflation.,1998-10-05
"There is a hint of stagflation in your forecast--below-trend growth and rising unemployment, on the one hand, and rising inflation on the other.",1998-10-05
"It reflects, I expect, on the inflation side, both the contribution of demand pressures in the labor market, as a consequence of the initial conditions, and dissipation or even reversal of the favorable supply shocks that have been restraining inflation.",1998-10-05
"A version that had slower growth and a sharper rise in the unemployment rate, but still well short of a recession, could be consistent, for example, with stable inflation, even beginning from initial conditions of very tight labor markets.",1998-10-05
I focus here on the contributions from net exports and private domestic demand.,1998-10-05
An external shock lowers net exports and slows GDP growth; the resulting slowdown in GDP growth then weakens domestic demand.,1998-10-05
"Even though the decline in net exports was much sharper than virtually anyone expected, subtracting more than 2 percentage points from growth, the economy's average growth did not differ much from the pace over the previous year.",1998-10-05
"The growth in the first half was, to be sure, unbalanced between the first and second quarters, but that was entirely due to the rise in inventory investment in the first quarter and its decline in the second.",1998-10-05
The strength of domestic demand and the subtraction via net exports were very similar in both quarters.,1998-10-05
The explanation for the stability of GDP growth was the surprising surge of private domestic demand that offset the sharper-than-expected decline in net exports.,1998-10-05
"Private domestic demand soared to an 8% annual rate in the first half, from the robust 4 ½% rate over the previous two years.",1998-10-05
This raises two questions: Why did private demand soar in the first half and why will the economy slow going forward?,1998-10-05
"To be sure, recent developments have reinforced the negative outlook for the external sector and net exports will be subtracting from GDP growth going forward.",1998-10-05
"But in the consensus forecast, net exports subtract less than half as much from GDP growth in the second half as in the first half and still less in 1999.",1998-10-05
"Hence, the slowdown scenario now depends critically on a slowing in domestic demand.",1998-10-05
"So while all eyes are focused on global turmoil and the spillover to U.S. net exports, I believe that you are correct to focus the case for slowdown ahead on diminished strength in private domestic demand.",1998-10-05
"There are three key developments that, in my view, justify a downward revision for the forecast for growth in 1999.",1998-10-05
"First, the further pressure on emerging market economies, especially Latin America, following the Russian default and devaluation merits a downward revision in the forecast for foreign growth and hence in U.S. net exports.",1998-10-05
"Second, the correction in equity prices points to a downward revision to consumer spending and to business fixed investment and residential construction as well.",1998-10-05
Phase one resulted in a powerful adverse shock to U.S. aggregate demand as a result of the decline in net exports induced by the combination of recessions and sharp depreciations in the region.,1998-10-05
"But the same global turmoil that undermined net exports also brought a shift in portfolio preferences toward dollar-denominated assets, resulting in lower interest rates and perhaps adding to the resilience of U.S. equity markets.",1998-10-05
"In addition, an important part of the decline in oil prices could be directly attributable to the regional turmoil, taking into account both the declines in income and the dramatic increase in the relative price of oil, priced in dollars, to this region.",1998-10-05
"The latter two developments buoyed U.S. private domestic demand, contributing at least in part to its strengthening during the first half and partially offsetting the restraint via net exports.",1998-10-05
"There has been a sharp correction of equity prices, in the United States and around the world, and rising risk spreads offset and, for the riskier borrowers, more than offset the effect of further declines in government bond rates.",1998-10-05
So phase two has added to the projected decline in net exports ahead and broadened the impact of global turmoil on domestic demand by undermining the favorable set of financial conditions that had been so important in promoting strong growth over the last couple of years.,1998-10-05
"Phase one failed to slow GDP growth, in part, because of offsets via lower interest rates and a lower price of oil.",1998-10-05
"They do not, I believe, fully explain the surge in domestic demand in the first half.",1998-10-05
Part of this surge may have reflected the lagged effects of the long period of rising equity prices and declining long-term rates.,1998-10-05
But part may simply have been an unexplained and fortuitous positive demand surprise.,1998-10-05
"In this case, the slowdown going forward will be reinforced to the extent these positive demand shocks dissipate.",1998-10-05
"Growth is going to slow, in part, because it was unexplainably high in the first half.",1998-10-05
It reminds me of the explanation of our forecast at LHM&A for a sharp decline in long-term interest rates in 1993.,1998-10-05
"The slowdown in 1999 will be the cumulative effect of this spontaneous slowing as the high-flying economy succumbs to the force of gravity and the induced slowing of the economy in response to weaker foreign growth, the recent decline in equity values, and the widening of risk spreads and generally reduced appetite for risk.",1998-10-05
A source of such discontinuity arises from possible devaluations in countries on a fixed or pegged exchange rate.,1998-10-05
"Whereas under floating rates, a gradual depreciation could take some pressure off an economy subject to an adverse shock, a forced devaluation in a country that can no longer defend its peg often reinforces rather than cushions the downward momentum in the economy in response to an adverse shock and can, therefore, be instrumental in abruptly moving an economy from slow growth to sharp recession.",1998-10-05
"They can be aggressive with the central tendency forecast and project a substantial slowing in growth, leaving us with about equal probabilities that growth will be faster or slower than the central tendency.",1998-10-05
"Both the central tendency and the perception of the probability distribution around that central tendency are important features of the ""outlook"" and are relevant to the setting of monetary policy.",1998-10-05
"Interestingly, as I have noted before, this is not a period over which there has been a slowdown in GDP growth.",1998-10-05
The margin squeeze reflects the effect of tight labor markets on wages and the deceleration in product prices over the last several quarters.,1998-10-05
One of the most dramatic developments over the last year has been a halving in the inflation rate for broad indices of domestically produced goods.,1998-10-05
"For example, the chain price measure for GDP has slowed from 2% over the four quarters ended in the second quarter of 1997 to just 1% over the four quarters ended in the second quarter of 1998.",1998-10-05
A couple of tenths of this slowdown can be attributed to developments in food and especially energy prices.,1998-10-05
"A key factor, I believe, was the increasingly rapid decline in import prices.",1998-10-05
"Nevertheless, I believe that the effect of declining import prices might have been as large or even larger on the GDP price measure than on the CPI or PCE price indices that directly include imports.",1998-10-05
One of the most important sources of restraint on inflation in this episode has been the effect of declining import prices on the pricing leverage of domestic producers of competing goods.,1998-10-05
"Given the tightness of labor markets, it has been widely expected that profit margins would narrow as the mark-up of prices over unit labor costs declined.",1998-10-05
This was expected to result from a gradual acceleration of wages relative to prices and to be a precursor of higher price inflation.,1998-10-05
"The mark-up has indeed declined, but more from a deceleration of prices relative to wages.",1998-10-05
"Instead of pointing toward higher inflation, the decline in the mark-up is in fact further evidence of forces restraining inflation.",1998-10-05
"Going forward, slower growth is likely to bring a cyclical slowing in productivity, reinforcing the effect of narrower margins on profits.",1998-10-05
The Challenge Facing Monetary Policy Now I turn to the implications of the outlook for monetary policy.,1998-10-05
Two-sided risks The first challenge facing monetary policy is the degree of two-sided risk the economy faces.,1998-10-05
"The upside risk, the threat of higher inflation, arises from the initial conditions and from the history of growth exceeding expectations over the past two years.",1998-10-05
"This set of initial conditions is clearly not one that supports, much less compels an easing in monetary policy.",1998-10-05
"The downside risk became noteworthy following the crises among Asian developing economies and Japan slipping from stagnation into recession and, more recently was exacerbated by the further contagion among emerging market economies, and the decline in equity prices and increased risk spreads here at home.",1998-10-05
"By late September, this balance had shifted enough, in my view, to justify an easing of monetary policy.",1998-10-05
"Asymmetric risk and the ""maximin"" solution The adjustment to the outlook that justified the policy change can be thought of as some combination of a lower central tendency for growth next year and a widening of the risk associated with downside possibilities relative to the baseline forecast.",1998-10-05
"For example, if there is no change in policy, the worse case outcome would be a sharp slowing in growth to well below the trend rate.",1998-10-05
"Under an easing, the worse case outcome would be that the economy turned out stronger than expected, so the easing was unwarranted, and inflation increased more sharply than projected.",1998-10-05
"My judgment is that the most worrisome possibility has become the former, justifying the easing of monetary policy last week.",1998-10-05
"During the period when the stance of monetary policy was asymmetric toward tightening, the focus was on whether or not a preemptive move toward restraint was justified in light of the progressive tightening of the labor market.",1998-10-05
"Because inflation continued to decline, even as labor markets became tighter, and because the turmoil in global markets held the possibility of some relief in U.S. labor markets, policy remained on hold, with the exception of the single 25-basis point tightening in March of 1997.",1998-10-05
"If labor markets initially are very tight, growth has been above trend, and there have been consistent surprises on the up side, there will be more caution in easing than if the economy were initially operating just at full employment and growing at trend.",1998-10-05
The Taylor Rule and balancing stabilization and inflation objectives I have talked on several occasions about the usefulness of the Taylor Rule as a starting point for thinking about monetary policy.,1998-10-05
"The Taylor Rule specifies how the federal funds rate should be adjusted over time in response to changing economic conditions, allowing attention to be paid to monetary policy's stabilization role in the context of the Federal Reserve's long-run price stability objective.",1998-10-05
"There are a variety of versions of this basic approach, depending on measures of utilization and inflation rates and depending on whether the adjustment is made in response to past and current movements in utilization and inflation rates or in response to forecasts of these variables.",1998-10-05
"I believe the current move can be justified in a forward-looking variant of the Taylor Rule, where today's policy depends on the forecast of future output gaps and inflation.",1998-10-05
"The policy is, therefore, well designed, in my judgment, to balance the stabilization and inflation objectives.",1998-10-05
"That is, a U.S. economy growing at its maximum sustainable rate, at its maximum sustainable utilization rate, and maintaining price stability would offer the very best support that we could possibly provide to the world economy.",1998-10-05
Our Congressional mandate is to achieve full employment and price stability in the United States.,1998-10-05
"It should be appreciated, however, that U.S. monetary policy has a far greater ability to shield the U.S. economy from global distress than to counter the powerful recessionary and deflationary forces in the world economy.",1998-10-05
"The stock market and monetary policy Just a short time ago, there was widespread concern that an overvalued stock market, an erosion of credit standards and failure to adequately reflect risk in asset prices were both contributing to the strength of the expansion and increasing the vulnerability of the economy.",1998-10-05
"The conventional wisdom for monetary policy, nevertheless, was not to assume that policymakers had a better ability to assess stock market valuations than market participants themselves.",1998-10-05
"The stock market, in this view, should be taken into account in monetary policy in the same way as myriad other considerations, only in so far as it affected the balance between supply and demand in the economy and hence projected macroeconomic performance.",1998-10-05
"The simulative effect of soaring equity prices was one of the considerations that, in my judgment, supported allowing the real federal funds rate to rise, as inflation declined over recent quarters.",1998-10-05
"Now that stock prices have moved lower and there has been some reversal of the excessive erosion in risk premiums, it would be wildly inconsistent to argue that these market developments themselves are the basis for easier monetary policy.",1998-10-05
"Once again, the issue is the effect of recent market developments on the forecast for growth, utilization rates and inflation and whether any such revision is sufficient to justify policy action.",1998-10-05
Conclusion The U.S. economy continues to operate at high utilization rates and with low inflation.,1998-10-05
But the cumulative force of recent developments appears likely to yield a slowing in the pace of growth next year.,1998-10-05
"Fortunately, monetary policy is capable of responding quickly to changing conditions.",1998-10-05
"The role of monetary policy, in this episode, is to cushion this slowdown, provide insurance against downside risks, and promote the reverse soft landing you have been consistently forecasting.",1998-10-05
"Your forecast, in particular, and consensus forecasts, in general, appear to appreciate both the ability and willingness of monetary policy to adjust as necessary to changing developments.",1998-10-05
"This perception is, I believe, one reason why consensus forecasts have changed so little in the face of recent developments that appeared to encourage downward revisions to the forecast for growth.",1998-10-05
"MA's consensus panel projected that GDP growth would be 2.1% over 1999, almost identical to your forecast.",1998-10-05
"This seems to further confirm that some things, like the growth forecast for 1999, apparently never change.",1998-10-05
"Indeed, to give the public more information regarding its plan for conducting monetary policy in accordance with its congressional mandate, the Federal Reserve on November 14 announced several important enhancements to its communication strategy.",2007-11-29
"Here is a brief overview of the main elements of the enhanced communication strategy: FOMC participants now provide projections for four key macroeconomic variables that together reflect our dual mandate of promoting price stability and maximum sustainable employment: the growth of real gross domestic product (GDP); the unemployment rate; overall consumer inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE); and core consumer inflation, which excludes food and energy prices.2 As I discussed in a recent speech, both inflation measures are important: Core inflation is a useful indicator of the underlying near-term trend of inflation, and overall inflation is what households and businesses ultimately care about (Mishkin, 2007c).",2007-11-29
"Therefore, a significant aspect of the enhanced communication strategy is that the FOMC has added the overall inflation rate to its announced projections.",2007-11-29
"The quantitative projections indicate participants' assessments of the most likely (that is, modal) outcomes for economic activity and inflation.",2007-11-29
"In particular, each participant makes an independent projection based on his or her own assessment of the ""appropriate"" path of monetary policy; that is, the path seen as most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that are consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate.",2007-11-29
"In the remainder of this speech, I will discuss how the modern science of monetary policy provides a strong rationale for the Federal Reserve's new communication policy, and then I'll describe how a number of key principles of monetary policy making are evident in the latest set of FOMC projections, which were released last week.",2007-11-29
The Rationale for the Federal Reserve's Enhanced Communication StrategyThe modern approach to the formulation of monetary policy is generally characterized by an optimization problem in which policymakers maximize a specific objective function subject to a set of constraints.,2007-11-29
"In contrast, expectations about future monetary policy and economic conditions play a key role in economic agents' decisions and thus are important in both the objective function and the constraints of the optimal monetary policy problem.",2007-11-29
This role of expectations is crucial in understanding why central bank communication is so important for achieving good macroeconomic outcomes.3 Objective Function The modern science of monetary policy proceeds under the assumption that the central bank's purpose is to maximize the well-being of households in the economy; the objective function specifies exactly what should be maximized.,2007-11-29
"Broadly speaking, the objective function has two components, each expressed as a deviation from a goal and each with a negative sign: one component is the deviation of inflation from its optimal level, and the other is the deviation of output (or employment) from its so-called natural level, the level that would be attained if prices and wages were completely flexible.",2007-11-29
"Those components of the objective function capture the essence of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate to promote price stability and maximum employment, a mandate established by the Congress for the ultimate good of the public.",2007-11-29
"Constraints In a market-oriented economy like ours, the science of monetary policy explicitly reflects the extent to which households and firms have the freedom to make their own economic decisions.",2007-11-29
The overall level of expenditures in the economy--which macroeconomists refer to as aggregate demand--is the sum of all the spending decisions of individual households and firms.,2007-11-29
"Aggregate demand exhibits a strong forward-looking component because, as noted, the spending decisions of households include their expectations regarding the future path of the economy.",2007-11-29
"Similarly, the overall inflation rate of the economy ultimately reflects the price-setting decisions of individual firms, and expectations have a crucial influence on those decisions as well.",2007-11-29
"However, both aggregate supply and aggregate demand tend to exhibit a substantial degree of inertia, which reflects the significant costs incurred by households and firms in making sudden large adjustments in their consumption, staffing levels, and so forth.",2007-11-29
"Largely because of those inertial elements, monetary policy actions have little or no instantaneous effect on the economy; in fact, the peak effect on aggregate demand may not appear for at least a year, and the peak effect on inflation is subject to even longer lags.",2007-11-29
"Therefore, because the variables the central bank wants to influence have a forward-looking component, and because the effects of policy actions are unlikely to appear for at least a year, macroeconomic projections should have a central role in the monetary policy plan and should appear in the public description of that plan.",2007-11-29
Broadening the scope of communication by including a description of policymakers' expectations helps households and businesses to make more-informed decisions and can help anchor the private sector's inflation expectations more firmly by clarifying and underscoring the central bank's intention to keep inflation low and stable over the long run.,2007-11-29
"In all of these ways, central-bank communication that more fully portrays policy considerations facilitates the effectiveness of monetary policy and contributes to the overall stability and growth of the economy.",2007-11-29
The Science of Monetary Policy and the Longer-Term OutlookI would now like to consider the important information conveyed about the FOMC's longer-term policy strategy in the Federal Reserve's newly released set of macroeconomic projections.,2007-11-29
"In that context, I will also highlight how our longer-term strategy fulfills the dual mandate and embeds some of the key implications of the modern science of monetary policy.",2007-11-29
The Longer-Term Projections for Inflation The projections for both overall and core inflation at the three-year horizon (which is currently 2010) fall in the range of 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent; the central tendency of these projections is 1.6 percent to 1.9 percent.,2007-11-29
"As I noted earlier, each FOMC participant's projection is made under the assumption of ""appropriate"" monetary policy--that is, the path of policy calibrated to achieve outcomes for economic activity and inflation that are most consistent with our dual objectives of price stability and maximum employment.",2007-11-29
"For that reason, the longer-run inflation projections provide information about each FOMC participant's assessment of the inflation rate that best promotes those dual objectives--a rate that I will refer to as the ""mandate-consistent inflation rate.""",2007-11-29
"When the underlying level of inflation is reasonably close to its mandate-consistent rate, monetary policy should be able to achieve that rate of inflation in coming years while keeping economic activity near its maximum sustainable level.",2007-11-29
"Although overall inflation is currently above the mandate-consistent rate, reflecting the effects of energy price increases, core inflation has been well-behaved.",2007-11-29
"Thus, I believe this description essentially characterizes the current macroeconomic environment, and my own projection of inflation at a three-year horizon is equal to my assessment of the mandate-consistent inflation rate.",2007-11-29
"The range of projections for inflation in 2010--1.5 percent to 2.0 percent--is consistent with a fundamental implication of the modern science of monetary policy--namely, that the well-being of the economy is maximized by maintaining a low and stable inflation rate over time.4 Low inflation promotes social welfare by simplifying the savings and retirement planning of individual households and by facilitating firms' production and investment decisions, all of which helps promote higher productivity growth.",2007-11-29
"Furthermore, an environment of overall price stability contributes to economic efficiency by reducing the variability of relative prices and by minimizing the distortions that arise because the tax system is not completely indexed to inflation.",2007-11-29
"Finally, and importantly, low and stable inflation promotes equity and reduces poverty, as the poorest members of society typically do not have access to the sorts of financial instruments that would help protect them against inflation.",2007-11-29
"At the same time, recent research on the science of monetary policy (as well as the analysis of several historical episodes) has underscored the pitfalls that can result from maintaining a zero or negative inflation rate over time.",2007-11-29
"First, such a strategy tends to raise the likelihood of episodes in which short-term nominal interest rates reach the zero lower bound and thereby hinder the conduct of monetary policy.",2007-11-29
"Second, an economy with a zero average inflation rate will almost inevitably experience some episodes of deflation, which may adversely affect financial markets and thereby hamper the performance of the macroeconomy.",2007-11-29
"Third, if inflation is at or below zero, downward rigidities in nominal wage adjustment might induce some distortions in labor market efficiency, with unfavorable consequences for the level of employment.",2007-11-29
"In light of these considerations, as Chairman Bernanke (2007) recently noted, ""the (properly measured) long-run inflation rate that best promotes the dual mandate is likely to be low but not zero.""",2007-11-29
"The science of monetary policy has also emphasized the importance of establishing the central bank's strong and credible commitment to keeping inflation low and stable over the long run because that commitment helps to stabilize inflation expectations; in turn, stable expectations aid the functioning of the economy and the efficacy of policy.",2007-11-29
"The increased information that these projections convey regarding FOMC participants' views of the mandate-consistent inflation rate, combined with the FOMC's continuing commitment to keeping inflation low and stable, should help anchor inflation expectations even more firmly.",2007-11-29
Better information on FOMC participants' views on the mandate-consistent inflation rate is also essential for achieving the other element of the dual mandate--maximum employment.,2007-11-29
"By increasing the likelihood of achieving a low and predictable inflation rate, providing information on the mandate-consistent inflation rate plays a crucial role in facilitating long-term growth in employment and labor productivity.",2007-11-29
"Furthermore, although the economy will inevitably be buffeted by various shocks, the knowledge that the monetary authority will take steps to move inflation gradually toward its mandate-consistent rate over time also helps minimize the deviations of employment and output from maximum sustainable levels.",2007-11-29
"The Longer-Term Projections for Growth and UnemploymentFor 2010, the central tendency of the range of projections for the growth of real GDP is 2.5 percent to 2.6 percent, and the projections for the unemployment rate have a central tendency of 4.7 percent to 4.9 percent.",2007-11-29
The full range of FOMC participants' projections is 2.2 percent to 2.7 percent for real GDP growth and 4.6 percent to 5.0 percent for the unemployment rate.,2007-11-29
"As indicated in the forecast narrative, these longer-run projections were heavily influenced by participants' assessments of the sustainable rates of output growth and employment.",2007-11-29
"However, assessments of potential output growth and the sustainable unemployment rate are fundamentally different from assessments of the mandate-consistent inflation rate.",2007-11-29
"In particular, as I emphasized in a speech last spring, the Federal Reserve can determine and achieve the long-run average rate of inflation in keeping with its dual mandate, but the Federal Reserve most emphatically cannot choose the level of maximum sustainable economic activity--no central bank can control the level of real economic activity or employment over the longer run (Mishkin, 2007a).",2007-11-29
"In addition, the maximum sustainable levels of output and employment cannot be known with any assurance (Mishkin, 2007b).",2007-11-29
The relatively narrow range of participants' longer-term projections for real GDP growth and the rate of unemployment must not be confused with the uncertainty attending those projections.,2007-11-29
"In that regard, macroeconometric analysis indicates that the sustainable unemployment rate and the growth rate of potential output have varied quite substantially over recent decades, thereby exacerbating the challenges of constructing estimates of these characteristics at any given point in time.",2007-11-29
"For example, Staiger, Stock, and Watson (1997a,b) obtained 95 percent confidence intervals for a measure of the sustainable unemployment rate that are at least 2 percentage points wide.",2007-11-29
"Thus, although FOMC participants' projections for the unemployment rate in 2010 provide information about their assessments of the sustainable unemployment rate, the analysis of Staiger, Stock, and Watson highlights the degree of uncertainty about these assessments--namely, the true value of that rate might well be as low as 3-3/4 percent or as high as 5-3/4 percent.",2007-11-29
The Science of Monetary Policy and the Shorter-Term ProjectionsNow let us take a brief look at the Federal Reserve's macroeconomic projections for 2007 through 2009.,2007-11-29
"These projections are useful for understanding the Federal Reserve's near-term policy strategy, and again, I would like to highlight how this strategy fulfills the dual mandate and embeds key implications of the modern science of monetary policy.",2007-11-29
The science emphasizes that monetary policy makers need to think in terms of a plan for the appropriate paths for inflation and economic activity that best promotes the dual mandate of price stability and maximum sustainable employment.,2007-11-29
"If economic activity is well below its maximum sustainable level, then monetary policy should aim at increasing output and employment toward sustainable levels.",2007-11-29
"If inflation is above the mandate-consistent rate, monetary policy should aim at reducing inflation to that rate.",2007-11-29
"Providing projections for the short run as well as for the longer run encourages FOMC participants to think in terms of desirable paths for inflation and output, a discipline that the science suggests will produce better policy outcomes.",2007-11-29
"The Inflation OutlookIn the projections of FOMC participants, core inflation edges down slightly and then remains fairly stable at about 1-3/4 percent toward the end of the decade.",2007-11-29
"Meanwhile, given an anticipated flattening out of energy prices, overall consumer inflation in these projections declines toward the core inflation rate; it drops from about 3 percent this year to about 2 percent in 2008 and then drops a bit further near the end of the decade.",2007-11-29
"These projections are consistent with a point I made in an earlier speech--namely, in recent decades core inflation has tended to be a good predictor of overall inflation further ahead (Mishkin, 2007c).",2007-11-29
"Furthermore, these projections demonstrate that FOMC participants do not think that the Federal Reserve should, or even could, achieve an immediate reduction of overall inflation to its mandate-consistent rate.",2007-11-29
The recent high level of overall inflation reflects rapidly rising energy prices that the Federal Reserve obviously cannot control.,2007-11-29
"For this reason, any attempt to bring overall inflation down too quickly would entail large losses of output and employment, and hence such an approach would be inconsistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate, which places a balanced emphasis on both price stability and maximum employment.",2007-11-29
The Outlook for Economic ActivityThe midpoint of the range of projections for real GDP growth declines noticeably from about 2-1/2 percent for 2007 to roughly 2 percent in 2008; then it returns to about 2-1/2 percent in 2009 and 2010.,2007-11-29
"As I have already noted, monetary policy works only with a lag and hence cannot offset these near-term effects; rather, the recent cuts in the federal funds rate are intended to help bring economic activity back to maximum sustainable levels over time, and such an outcome can be seen in the broad contours of the FOMC projections.",2007-11-29
There is considerable diversity in the views of participants about the outlook for near-term growth.,2007-11-29
"The range of forecasts for the growth of real GDP in 2008 is from 1.6 percent to 2.6 percent--twice as wide as in the previous set of FOMC projections, which were published last June.",2007-11-29
These averages of projection errors indicate that the degree of uncertainty about the growth outlook is even wider than the range of the participants' forecasts.,2007-11-29
"For example, at a one-year forecast horizon, the root mean squared prediction error is 1.3 percentage points for the growth of real GDP and 0.6 percentage points for the unemployment rate, as compared to 1.0 percentage points and 0.4 percentage points respectively for participants' forecasts of real GDP growth and unemployment.",2007-11-29
"Furthermore, in the latest report, FOMC participants indicated that the current degree of uncertainty about GDP growth is even higher than the typical level of uncertainty over the past two decades.",2007-11-29
"Although the current projections involve relatively stable trajectories for economic activity and inflation, the regular communication of Federal Reserve projections would become particularly useful in a setting in which the economy started from a position further away from its long-run balanced-growth path.",2007-11-29
"In such circumstances, the task of monetary policy is to help guide the economy back toward the balanced-growth path, and the appropriate speed of that convergence will depend on the nature of the shocks that have affected the economy.",2007-11-29
"In addition, enhanced communication can help anchor the public's inflation expectations, which promotes both price stability and higher economic growth.",2007-11-29
"As we have seen, the new communication strategy is consistent with what the modern science of monetary policy suggests is needed to achieve good monetary policy outcomes.",2007-11-29
"We at the Federal Reserve have the task, delegated by the Congress, of conducting monetary policy to enhance the welfare of our citizens.",2007-11-29
"In that regard, the Federal Reserve's enhanced communication strategy will be useful in enabling the FOMC to explain its policy decisions and strategies more fully in the context of its medium-term objectives for economic activity and inflation and the risks to those objectives.",2007-11-29
"As a result, the public and the Congress can better assess whether our forecasts of the economy are reasonable and whether we are pursuing a policy strategy that is consistent with achieving the dual mandate of price stability and maximum sustainable employment.",2007-11-29
"The near-term path of interest rates is highly uncertain and depends on the implications of the incoming data, which in some cases are evolving right up to the time of the meeting.",2007-11-29
What is more certain--and far more important--is the commitment of the FOMC to move interest rates as needed to foster outcomes consistent with our dual mandate of maximum sustainable employment and price stability.,2007-11-29
"Moreover, the approach we have taken is consistent with what the science of monetary policy tells us will result in better outcomes for price stability and maximum employment.",2007-11-29
"Before we begin our conversation, I would like to share a few thoughts about the outlook for the U.S. economy and monetary policy.1 The U.S. economy is in a good place, and the baseline outlook is favorable.",2019-10-18
"The median expectation from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants' most recent Summary of Economic Projections is for GDP growth to be around 2 percent in 2019, for growth to continue near this pace next year, and for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation to rise gradually to our symmetric 2 percent objective.2 The unemployment rate, at 3.5 percent, is at a half-century low, and wages are rising broadly in line with productivity growth and underlying inflation.",2019-10-18
There is no evidence to date that a strong labor market is putting excessive cost-push pressure on price inflation.,2019-10-18
"Global growth estimates continue to be marked down, and global disinflationary pressures cloud the outlook for U.S. inflation.",2019-10-18
U.S. inflation remains muted.,2019-10-18
"Over the 12 months through August, PCE inflation is running at 1.4 percent, and core PCE inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is running at 1.8 percent.",2019-10-18
"Turning now to monetary policy, at both its July and September meetings, the FOMC voted to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.3 With these decisions, the current target range for the federal funds rate is 1.75 to 2 percent, which compares with the range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent that prevailed between December 2018 and July 2019.",2019-10-18
The Committee took these actions to provide a somewhat more accommodative policy in response to muted inflation pressures and the risks to the outlook I mentioned earlier.,2019-10-18
"Looking ahead, monetary policy is not on a preset course, and the Committee will proceed on a meeting-by-meeting basis to assess the economic outlook as well as the risks to the outlook, and it will act as appropriate to sustain growth, a strong labor market, and a return of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent objective.",2019-10-18
"In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to conduct term and overnight repo operations at least through January to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample even during periods of temporary, but pronounced, increases in our nonreserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk that money market pressures adversely affect monetary policy implementation.",2019-10-18
"The technical measures we are undertaking do not represent a change in the stance of monetary policy, which we continue to implement by adjusting the target range for the federal funds rate.",2019-10-18
"Finally, I would like to say a few words about the monetary policy framework review we are undertaking this year.",2019-10-18
"This review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communications is the first of its kind for the Federal Reserve.",2019-10-18
We will draw on these insights as we assess how best to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability in the most robust fashion possible.,2019-10-18
"Regional Meeting, U.S. Chamber of Commerce's National Chamber Foundation, Washington, D.C. April 14, 1999 The Global Economic Outlook and Challenges Facing Monetary Policy around the World My theme today is that this is a particularly interesting and challenging time to be a central banker, virtually anywhere in the world.",1999-04-14
"Interestingly, despite the common backdrop of weak world growth and turbulence in world foreign exchange and financial markets, there is an unusual diversity of domestic macroeconomic experiences across countries and therefore quite different challenges faced by monetary policymakers around the world.",1999-04-14
The crises in many emerging market economies and the resulting turbulence in global foreign exchange and financial markets and slowdown in world growth have been the dominant events of the last year and a half.,1999-04-14
"Another theme in the global economy has been the steady decline in inflation, now to the point where, at least among the industrial countries, price stability has been achieved or is in sight.",1999-04-14
"There has been some ambivalence about whether, as a result, to celebrate the achievement of price stability or to shift the focus of concern from inflation to ""deflation,"" particularly in light of the deflation under way in Japan.",1999-04-14
"I want to emphasize at the outset that the views I present this afternoon, both about the economic outlook and monetary policy, are my own views and should not be interpreted as an expression of the views of the Board of Governors or the FOMC.",1999-04-14
Global Influences on Domestic Economies and Challenges to Monetary Policy Around the World Domestic macroeconomic performance and policy around the world are being dramatically affected by global developments.,1999-04-14
"The Global Slowdown The common backdrop for economies around the world is, of course, the slowdown in global growth.",1999-04-14
"World economic growth was in the range of 4% to 5% in 1996 and 1997, measured on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis, above the trend rate of 3 ½% over the last couple of decades.",1999-04-14
"In 1998, global growth slowed to just 2%, the lowest 4-quarter growth rate since the 1982 recession in the U.S.",1999-04-14
"The roughly 2 ½ percentage point slowdown from 1996 to 1998 was, in addition, the sharpest over any two-year period since 1978-80, the second OPEC oil shock, when world growth slowed to around 2 ½%.",1999-04-14
"Because the U.S. accounts for a relatively large share of world GDP, global growth usually hits its lows during U.S. recessions.",1999-04-14
What was unusual about 1998 was that this slowdown in global growth occurred during a period of exceptionally rapid and indeed strengthening U.S. growth.,1999-04-14
"As a result, the excess of U.S. growth over foreign growth in 1998 was the largest in nearly two decades.",1999-04-14
"Sources of the Global Slowdown The largest contributor to the global slowdown from 1996 through 1998 was emerging Asia, where growth slowed from the 9% to 10% range during the mid-1990s (1994 - 96) to a little over 2% in 1998, accounting for two-fifths of the 2 ½ percentage point slowdown of global growth from 1996 to 1998.",1999-04-14
"Also making major contributions were Latin America, which has been subject to contagion from Asia, by way of Russia, and Japan, which has been depressed by ongoing structural problems in its financial sector and slid from slow growth in 1997 into recession in 1998.",1999-04-14
"The sharp slowdown of Japan over the past two years, for example, subtracted almost 2/3 percentage point from world GDP growth, and was part of the adverse shocks that contributed to the downturn among the emerging Asian economies.",1999-04-14
"Global Disinflation The global disinflation trend, typically interrupted late in cyclical expansions, has resumed during the past year.",1999-04-14
"Among the industrial countries, inflation has declined over the last 25 years from a peak of about 15% in 1974, at the time of the first OPEC oil shock, to around 1½% in 1998.",1999-04-14
"This disinflation trend has been less steady, but cumulatively no less impressive, among developing economies over the same period.",1999-04-14
"The recent disinflation is partly due to the global slowdown, but also reflects some of the same favorable supply shocks (declining oil prices, for example, and, for the developed economies, an appreciation in exchange rates relative to developing economies) that have been at work with respect to U.S. inflation.",1999-04-14
"Going forward, inflation among the industrial countries might well decline even further this year, reflecting the deflation under way in Japan and a continuation of low and relatively well-contained inflation elsewhere.",1999-04-14
"Global Growth Prospects Looking forward, the consensus outlook is for continued slow growth in the world economy this year, with a modest pickup likely in 2000.",1999-04-14
"This outlook reflects the balancing of a moderate decline in growth in the industrial economies, reinforced by weaker growth in Latin America this year, and a more pronounced pickup in Asian emerging market countries this year, and likely in Latin America next year.",1999-04-14
"Among industrial economies, growth is expected to remain low in the U.K. this year, to remain slightly below trend in the euro area, to become at least less negative in Japan, and to slow from an unsustainably high level in the U.S.",1999-04-14
"While the projected slowdown among the industrial countries is dominated by the expected slowing in the U.S., it also reflects the expectation that growth will not materially pick up in the U.K. or the euro area, and that Japan will remain weak.",1999-04-14
The swing in the region from a decline in output to low positive growth is expected to be the major positive contribution to higher world growth this year.,1999-04-14
"As Latin America moves toward recovery next year and emerging Asian economies continue to strengthen, the developing economies may provide the major boost in world growth in 2000.",1999-04-14
Diversity among the Industrial Economies The diversity in growth rates across the industrial countries has been an important feature of the global economy over the past year.,1999-04-14
"These disparities in cyclical conditions and resulting changes in their real interest rate differentials have had important impacts on the pattern of exchange rates, net exports, and current account balances across these countries.",1999-04-14
"In the case of the U.S., these growth rate differentials and exchange rate movements have resulted in a persistent drag from net exports on real output growth and a widening of the current account deficit, on the one hand, and restraint on inflation, on the other hand--reinforcing the effects of the crises among emerging market economies on U.S. net exports and inflation.",1999-04-14
"In light of concerns about wide swings in the exchange rates among major currencies, some have called for a system of target zones for exchange rates.",1999-04-14
"Moving to such a system would require assigning monetary policy to the task of targeting exchange rates, and countries are free to do so if they wish.",1999-04-14
"But, given the very different domestic conditions across industrial countries today, the cost of ignoring domestic considerations in order to stabilize exchange rates would, in my judgment, be considerable.",1999-04-14
My preference is to use monetary policy to stabilize the U.S. economy and I can imagine that central bankers in other major economies would share this sentiment with respect to their own economies.,1999-04-14
"The most obvious spillover is the adverse external demand shock, via the decline in net exports, as a result of the combination of sharp declines in economic activity and dramatic devaluation of currencies in many emerging market economies.",1999-04-14
"But, the net effect on demand, both in the U.S. and in other industrial economies, has also been influenced by how each economy has been affected by other developments set in motion by these crises.",1999-04-14
"First, there have been safe haven capital flows into the U.S. that have lowered long-term interest rates and buoyed equity markets.",1999-04-14
"Second, the slowing of aggregate demand globally has also depressed the prices of oil and other commodities.",1999-04-14
"While the U.S. oil and agricultural sectors have been hurt by this downturn in the prices of their output, the economy as a whole has benefited on balance because the U.S. is a net consumer and importer of oil and many other commodities.",1999-04-14
"The decline in energy and other commodity prices have helped to restrain inflationary pressures, and households have benefited accordingly.",1999-04-14
"Until the Russian default and devaluation, the positive effects of lower interest rates and lower oil and non-oil commodity prices appeared to have contributed importantly to the strength of domestic demand in the U.S., offsetting, at least in part, the adverse effect on net exports.",1999-04-14
One reason these market developments appeared to be so serious for the U.S. was that they threatened to reverse the improvement in domestic financial conditions that had been so important in blunting the adverse demand shock from abroad.,1999-04-14
Restoring Global Growth What can be done to restore growth to more desirable levels on a global scale?,1999-04-14
"As a result, we might look for situations where domestic policy objectives coincide with the global interest of sustaining growth.",1999-04-14
This must be complemented by continued progress toward structural reform in order to lay the foundations for longer-term growth.,1999-04-14
"Conversely, some Latin American economies probably will have to endure a further period of tightened economic policies until fiscal positions are strengthened, and the inflationary response of recent devaluations of their currencies (most notably the Brazilian real) can be restrained.",1999-04-14
"With growth remaining well below historical levels in the emerging market economies, and with no scope for a further pickup in growth in the U.S., attention naturally focuses on the remaining industrial countries to support global growth.",1999-04-14
"Many of these countries, with their subdued rates of inflation and high levels of unemployment, are likely to have the greatest flexibility to ease monetary and fiscal policies--in fact, arguably, it is in these countries that a mutuality of domestic and global interest in stronger growth is most likely to exist.",1999-04-14
"The scope for fiscal expansion may be constrained in Japan by the very large deficits resulting from the huge fiscal measures that have already been taken, and in Europe by the fact that key countries are already bumping up against the limits set by the Maastricht Treaty.",1999-04-14
"As a result, attention is focused on monetary policy in these countries and around the world.",1999-04-14
"The Challenges Facing Monetary Policy around the World As I noted earlier, despite the common backdrop of weak world demand and turbulence in global financial markets, the diversity of domestic economic conditions around the world translates into an unusual variety of challenges facing central banks.",1999-04-14
"Before I turn to the country-specific challenges, let me return to the recent trend of global disinflation.",1999-04-14
"As I note earlier, this trend has now brought inflation rates among the industrial countries to the vicinity of price stability.",1999-04-14
"It should be recognized that once price stability is achieved, there will be increased risk that a downturn in economic activity could result in cyclical episodes of deflation.",1999-04-14
"Assuming that deflation is to be as much avoided as inflation, and some would say more, the challenge for central banks is to be symmetrical in the pursuit of their inflation targets.",1999-04-14
"That is, just as when inflation is above target, monetary policy is focused on restoring inflation to target, so should policy respond when inflation falls below target.",1999-04-14
"Indeed, one could argue that there is a case for an asymmetric policy response, one favoring a more timely and sharper policy response to inflation below than above target.",1999-04-14
"The reason is that, while monetary policy can always lower inflation by lowering money growth and raising interest rates, recent experience in Japan suggests that monetary policy might be limited in its ability to bolster aggregate demand and hence combat deflation, once short-term nominal interest rates have been driven to zero.",1999-04-14
Japanese monetary policymakers are confronting precisely this problem.,1999-04-14
"They face the challenge of escaping from recession, amidst gathering deflation and serious banking and financial sector problems at a point when monetary policy, with short-term interest rates almost at zero, appears now to have all but exhausted the potential for stimulus associated with conventional measures.",1999-04-14
"Even if monetary policy cannot affect short or long-term rates, is it possible nevertheless to stimulate demand by forcing liquidity into the system and raising monetary growth, and, if so, through what channels would that operate?",1999-04-14
"Does the continuing weakness in the banking sector limit the ability of easier monetary policy in Japan to stimulate domestic demand, especially given the dominant role of the banking system in the allocation of credit to the private sector in Japan?",1999-04-14
"Will the recent accelerated measures to resolve the banking crisis in Japan have a near-term positive payoff to growth, or will it initially worsen the credit crunch?",1999-04-14
"Finally, if, as a result of reaching a zero short-term interest rate and lingering banking problems, the major channel for stimulus is depreciation of the yen, are the emerging market economies in Asia strong enough to withstand this development without a relapse?",1999-04-14
"But growth has slowed to below trend, and, in the context of already very high unemployment, not all of which is structural, and low inflation, the ECB moved last week to significantly reduce its main lending rate from 3% to 2 ½%.",1999-04-14
"Nowhere, however, is the challenge to monetary policymakers greater than in emerging economies around the world.",1999-04-14
"Here the issues have centered on how aggressively to raise interest rates to defend pegged exchange rate regimes and, in the event of a change to floating rates, how aggressively to tighten to avoid overshooting of exchange rates and how to establish a monetary policy framework to control inflation.",1999-04-14
"The challenge of setting monetary policy following a move from fixed to floating rates has proved to be especially difficult, as events in Brazil have illustrated.",1999-04-14
"Monetary policymakers have had to balance the role of higher interest rates in avoiding overshooting of the currency and controlling inflation, against their effects on the real economy, on financial instability in light of potential banking and corporate debt problems, and on fiscal deficits via higher debt-service burdens.",1999-04-14
The U.S. Outlook and Challenges Facing U.S. Monetary Policy That brings me to the U.S.,1999-04-14
"Many would ask what challenges could monetary policymakers possibly face in the U.S., given the remarkable combination of consistent above-trend growth and declining inflation?",1999-04-14
"The U.S. economy has been blessed over the last three years with above-trend growth, declining unemployment rates, soaring equity prices, and declining inflation.",1999-04-14
The unexpected strength in equity prices has combined with other positive demand surprises across a wide range of spending components to produce faster-than-expected growth and a progressive tightening of labor markets.,1999-04-14
"At the same time, some combination of temporary but nevertheless persistent favorable supply shocks and perhaps more permanent supply-enhancing structural changes have prevented the pickup in inflation that otherwise would have been expected from persistently robust demand and unusually high and rising labor utilization rates.",1999-04-14
"To square the circle, investor optimism about the implications of possible structural changes for business profitability have helped to fuel the run-up in equity prices.",1999-04-14
"Important sources of restraint on inflation in the current episode have come from the decline in energy prices over 1997 and 1998; the appreciation of the dollar over the three years through mid-1998 and the resulting decline in non-oil import prices; sharper-than-previous declines in computer prices over the past three years; and a slower rate of increase in health care prices, including the cost of health care insurance.",1999-04-14
"Given that all of these developments have at best a transitory effect on inflation, as the inflation benefits of the shocks dissipate or as the shocks reverse, inflation is likely to rise somewhat.",1999-04-14
"Indeed, virtually every forecast projects a modest rise in broad measures of U.S. inflation this year, reflecting the dissipation or reversal of favorable supply shocks, most importantly the reversal in the path of oil prices, the stabilization of commodity prices and non-oil import prices, and some rebound in health care costs.",1999-04-14
But the more serious question is to what degree thereafter tight labor markets begin to exert upward pressure on wage change and hence inflation.,1999-04-14
"Even with generous allowances for structural change, labor utilization would seem to be at a level that might eventually begin to put persistent and growing pressure on labor costs and prices.",1999-04-14
"As a result, the challenge for monetary policy, to the extent recent U.S. performance has been driven by temporary supply shocks, is to facilitate a transition from the current exceptional but unsustainable state, to a less exceptional but more sustainable one, prior to the supply shocks dissipating or inflation increasing by an unacceptable amount.",1999-04-14
Supply-enhancing structural changes include both an apparent decline in the NAIRU (raising the sustainable level of output) and a possible increase in the trend rate of productivity growth (raising the sustainable growth rate of output).,1999-04-14
Together these structural changes would imply that the economy can now operate at a lower unemployment rate and at a higher growth rate than previously without inflationary consequences.,1999-04-14
"To the extent that recent performance has been driven by these more permanent structural changes, the role of monetary policy might be to accommodate this more favorable performance rather than to constrain it.",1999-04-14
"The fundamental challenge to monetary policy in the U.S. is, therefore, to set a strategy that respects the uncertainty about the sources of the recent exceptional experience, takes advantages of any opportunities for better performance, while mitigating the risks of overtaxing the limits of sustainable production and growth.",1999-04-14
"The key, in my judgment, is to understand that, even if the limits to the level and growth rate of GDP have been relaxed, the old rules about the consequences of overtaxing the economy's productive capacity still apply to the new limits.",1999-04-14
How has monetary policy navigated these challenges over the last few years?,1999-04-14
"For much of that period, monetary policy remained on hold, as declining inflation delivered a rise in the real federal funds rate that was viewed as appropriate in light of the steady rise in labor utilization rates and accommodative conditions in other sectors of the financial markets.",1999-04-14
"Thus, despite our inactivity, monetary policy ""leaned against the cyclical winds"" in quite a traditional manner and indeed in line with the prescription for monetary policy from the Taylor Rule.",1999-04-14
"The turbulence in financial markets and abrupt deterioration in the outlook for foreign growth prompted three easing moves late last year, from the end of September through mid-November.",1999-04-14
"In addition, the sharp downward revision in the forecast for growth over 1999 suggested the need for more accommodative policy.",1999-04-14
"In any case, the real federal funds rate is now lower than prior to the easings, at the same time that the unemployment rate is lower and projected growth higher than it was prior to the easings.",1999-04-14
"This might be understood as having occurred, in large part, as a result of reluctance to respond in traditional ways to rising labor utilization rates, in light of uncertainties about the estimate of NAIRU and, indeed, about the relevance of this model of inflation dynamics.",1999-04-14
"The question that has to be confronted is whether such an accommodating policy remains appropriate, going forward, especially once the unemployment rate has declined to the low end or below the low end of the range of estimates of NAIRU.",1999-04-14
"Growth may slow going forward; at least preventing further increases in labor market tightness, and perhaps even unwind some of the prevailing tightness in labor markets.",1999-04-14
"Second, growth could remain above trend and the unemployment rate could continue to fall, while, at the same time, inflation fell still further.",1999-04-14
"However, if inflation does not move lower, while growth remains above trend and labor markets tighten further, it would, in my view, be appropriate to relink real federal funds rate movements back to changes in labor utilization rates.",1999-04-14
The failure to do so could run the risk of unleashing inflation pressures that would be disruptive to reverse.,1999-04-14

"November 01, 2006 Community Development Financial Institutions: Promoting Economic Growth and Opportunity Chairman Ben S. Bernanke At the Opportunity Finance Networkâ€™s Annual Conference, Washington, D.C. Share Good afternoon and thank you for inviting me to speak to your annual conference.",2006-11-01
"Ensuring that every American has the chance to improve his or her economic circumstances through hard work, saving, entrepreneurship, and other productive activities is essential for building healthy communities and achieving sustainable economic growth.",2006-11-01
But the Fedâ€™s central mission--to help maintain a financial and macroeconomic environment that fosters price stability and maximum sustainable employment--is of necessity focused on the economic performance of the nation as a whole.,2006-11-01
"Monetary policy is a blunt tool that cannot target industries, population groups, or regions.",2006-11-01
"The growth of subprime mortgage lending is one indication of the extent to which access to credit has increased for all households, including those with lower incomes.",2006-11-01
"The release this year and last of mortgage price data gathered under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) has highlighted a different, but potentially related, concern about access to credit on equal terms.",2006-11-01
"The data show that blacks and Hispanics are considerably more likely than other borrowers to receive higher-priced loans.4 This finding has several possible--and not mutually exclusive--explanations, ranging from illegal discrimination to the effects of legitimate pricing factors not captured in the HMDA data, such as loan-to-value ratios and borrower credit history.",2006-11-01
"In our enforcement efforts, we analyze the HMDA price disparities in conjunction with other information, such as the adequacy of the lenderâ€™s fair lending controls and the presence of business practices that may put lenders at risk for pricing discrimination.",2006-11-01
"For example, a lender might offer its loan officers financial incentives that have the effect of inducing them to charge some applicants higher interest rates or to â€œsteerâ€ them to higher-priced loan products.",2006-11-01
"Loan price disparities, however, are not just a legal and supervisory issue.",2006-11-01
"The questions I raised earlier about access to prime products, lender competition, and borrower awareness and financial literacy may well be relevant to understanding the price disparities we observe.",2006-11-01
"In fact, the Federal Reserveâ€™s upcoming Community Affairs Research Conference will feature several papers that explore these issues.5 Homeownership The important issue of loan pricing aside, expanded access to mortgage credit has helped fuel substantial growth in homeownership.",2006-11-01
"However, despite the relatively more rapid growth in minority homeownership, significant differences persist: For example, the homeownership rate for blacks and Hispanics remains about two-thirds the rate for non-Hispanic whites.",2006-11-01
"Standard economic analysis tells us that when competitive conditions prevail in a market, the resulting prices induce firms and individuals to allocate resources in a manner that tends to maximize social welfare.12 However, economists also recognize that various deviations from idealized market conditions, termed market failures, can inhibit the efficient allocation of resources.13 In one type of market failure, called a neighborhood externality, the actions of one person affect the well-being or economic welfare of others in the local area, but the individual taking the action neither bears the full costs of nor reaps the full benefits from those actions.",2006-11-01
"I want to emphasize at the outset that the views I present this evening, both about the economic outlook and monetary policy, are my own views and should not be interpreted as an expression of the views of the Board of Governors or the FOMC.",1999-02-25
"Interestingly, despite the common backdrop of weak world growth and turbulence in world foreign exchange and financial markets, there is an unusual diversity of domestic macroeconomic experiences across countries and therefore quite different challenges faced by monetary policymakers around the world.",1999-02-25
"Global Influences on Domestic Economies and Challenges to Monetary Policy Around the World Today, it seems more than ever, domestic macroeconomic performance and policy around the world are being dramatically affected by global developments.",1999-02-25
"Second, the serious crises in many emerging market economies, resulting in both sharp declines in their economic activity and turbulence in global foreign exchange and financial markets, have had repercussions throughout the global economy.",1999-02-25
"Overall, this adds up to unusually weak global growth, continuing risks of renewed financial market turbulence, and, at least outside the U.S., more downside risks to demand than upside potential.",1999-02-25
"As you well know, the robust expansion in the United States has been juxtaposed with unprecedented recession in Japan, while Europe, the U.K., and Canada have experienced more moderate growth than the U.S.",1999-02-25
"These differential growth rates among the industrial economies and resulting changes in their real interest rate differentials, and hence exchange rates, have had an important impact on net exports across these countries.",1999-02-25
"In the case of the U.S., these developments have interacted to result in a persistent drag from net exports on real output growth and a widening of the current account deficit, on the one hand, and restraint on inflation, on the other hand.",1999-02-25
"In light of concerns about wide swings in the exchange rates among major currencies, some have called for a system of target zones for exchange rates.",1999-02-25
"Moving to such a system would require assigning monetary policy to the task of targeting exchange rates, and countries are free to do so if they wish.",1999-02-25
"But, given the very different domestic conditions across industrial countries today, the cost of ignoring domestic considerations in order to stabilize exchange rates would, in my judgment, be considerable.",1999-02-25
My preference is to use monetary policy to stabilize the U.S. economy and I can imagine that central bankers in other major economies would share this sentiment with respect to their own economies.,1999-02-25
"The most obvious spillover is the adverse external demand shock, via the decline in net exports, as a result of the combination of sharp declines in economic activity and dramatic devaluation of currencies in many emerging market economies.",1999-02-25
"In the U.S., this has powerfully reinforced the effects on net exports of slower growth in the foreign G-10 economies and, until late in 1998, an appreciation of the dollar against the foreign G-10 currencies.",1999-02-25
"But the net effect on demand, both in the U.S. and in other industrial economies, has also been influenced by how each economy has been affected by other developments set in motion by these crises.",1999-02-25
"First, there have been safe haven capital flows that, in the case of the U.S., lowered long-term interest rates and buoyed equity markets.",1999-02-25
"Second, the slowing of aggregate demand globally has also depressed the prices of oil and other commodities.",1999-02-25
"While the U.S. oil and agricultural sectors have been hurt by this downturn in the prices of their output, the economy as a whole has benefited on balance because the United States is a net consumer and importer of oil and many other commodities.",1999-02-25
"The decline in energy and other commodity prices have helped to restrain inflationary pressures, and households and firms that depend on these items as inputs to their production have benefited accordingly.",1999-02-25
"Until the Russian default and devaluation, the positive effects of lower interest rates and lower oil and non-oil commodity prices appeared to have contributed importantly to the strength of domestic demand in the U.S., offsetting, at least in part, the adverse effect on net exports.",1999-02-25
One reason these market developments appeared to be so serious for the U.S. was that they threatened to reverse the improvement in domestic financial conditions that had been so important in blunting the adverse demand shock from abroad.,1999-02-25
"The Challenges Facing Monetary Policy Around the World Despite the common backdrop of weak world demand and turbulence in global financial markets, the diversity of domestic economic conditions around the world translates into a variety of challenges facing central banks.",1999-02-25
"In the U.K., for example, what had looked like a traditional late-cycle challenge of resisting any tendency for inflation to increase, relative to the official target, while avoiding a premature halt in the expansion, has been complicated by the adverse shock from abroad.",1999-02-25
"Monetary policy, with short-term interest rates almost at zero, appears to have now all but exhausted the potential for stimulus associated with conventional measures.",1999-02-25
"The U.S. experience in the Great Depression appears to confirm Keynes' worry that, despite the ability of monetary policymakers to push short-term rates to zero, there are limits on how low long-term rates can be driven.",1999-02-25
"Even if monetary policy cannot affect short or long-term rates, is it possible nevertheless to stimulate demand by forcing liquidity into the system and raising monetary growth, and, if so, through what channels would that operate?",1999-02-25
"But growth appears to be slowing to below trend, in the context of already very high unemployment rates, not all of which is structural, and low inflation.",1999-02-25
"Nowhere, however, is the challenge to monetary policymakers greater than in emerging economies around the world.",1999-02-25
"Here the issues have centered on how aggressively to raise interest rates to defend pegged exchange rate regimes and, in the event of a change to floating rates, how aggressively to tighten to avoid overshooting of exchange rates and how to establish a monetary policy framework to control inflation.",1999-02-25
"The challenge of setting monetary policy following a move from fixed to floating rates has proved to be especially difficult, as events in Brazil have illustrated.",1999-02-25
"Monetary policymakers have had to balance the role of higher interest rates in avoiding overshooting of the currency and controlling inflation, against their effects on the real economy, on financial instability in light of potential banking and corporate debt problems, and on fiscal deficits via higher debt-service burdens.",1999-02-25
"Many would ask what challenges could monetary policymakers possibly face in the U.S., given the remarkable combination of consistent above-trend growth and declining inflation?",1999-02-25
"The U.S. economy has been blessed with consistent above-trend growth, declining unemployment rates, soaring equity prices, and declining inflation.",1999-02-25
The unexpected strength in equity prices has combined with other positive demand surprises across a wide range of spending components to produce faster-than-expected growth and a progressive tightening of labor markets.,1999-02-25
"At the same time, some combination of favorable supply shocks and supply-enhancing structural changes have prevented the pick-up in inflation that otherwise would have been expected from persistently robust demand and progressively higher labor utilization rates.",1999-02-25
"The Role of Excess Demand, Supply Shocks, and Productivity It appears that both supply shocks and structural change have played a part in explaining the recent exceptional U.S. economic performance.",1999-02-25
"Therefore, let me turn to the role of these developments in U.S. inflation dynamics.",1999-02-25
"In the long run, inflation is, as Milton Friedman has taught us, always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.",1999-02-25
"But that still leaves us to identify the proximate sources of changes of inflation, the role of transitory shocks, and the effect of possible changes in NAIRU and/or the productivity trend.",1999-02-25
The two key proximate sources of inflation pressure are excess demand and supply shocks.,1999-02-25
"Traditionally, excess demand pressures are viewed as operating initially through wage pressures in labor markets and being passed through via higher unit labor costs to prices.",1999-02-25
"Labor market pressures are often judged by the relationship between the prevailing unemployment rate and NAIRU, the ""non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment.""",1999-02-25
Supply shocks refer to the effect on inflation of changes in the prices of specific commodities that are unrelated to the balance between supply and demand in the domestic economy.,1999-02-25
"Historically, the important supply shocks have been sharp movements in food or energy prices, often related to weather and political developments.",1999-02-25
"In the current episode in the U.S., important sources of restraint in inflation have come from a decline in energy prices over the past two years; a three-year period, through mid 1998, of appreciation of the dollar and declining import prices; sharper-than-previous declines in computer prices over the past three years; and a slower rate of increase in health care prices, including the cost of health care insurance.",1999-02-25
The direct impact of supply shocks depends on the weight of the affected goods and services in broader price measures.,1999-02-25
Indirect effects arise both from the role of those goods and services as inputs in production and through the effect on the wage-price process.,1999-02-25
"A decline in overall inflation via favorable supply shocks lowers the pressure for nominal wage increases, which, in turn, reduces price pressures for a broader range of goods and services.",1999-02-25
"An increase in trend productivity growth will result in higher real wage growth, but the transition to higher real wages may include a near-term decline in inflation.",1999-02-25
"For example, an unexpected acceleration in productivity might initially leave nominal wage change unaffected, but reduce price pressures by lowering costs--thus contributing to both higher real wage growth and, for a while, lower inflation.",1999-02-25
One additional feature of recent experience that might also be important is the divergence between measures of labor market and product market demand balance.,1999-02-25
"While the unemployment rate has declined to a 28-year low and to well below prevailing estimates of NAIRU, the capacity utilization rate is below its long-term average and estimates of its natural rate.",1999-02-25
It appears that a portion of the higher productivity growth has come through capital deepening and more generally has been associated with very rapid growth in the capital stock--especially high-tech equipment.,1999-02-25
The relevance of this development is that the absence of demand pressures in product markets likely contributes to the perceived absence of pricing leverage by good-producing firms.,1999-02-25
"In addition, the resulting difficulty in passing on cost increases may have made firms more reluctant to bid up the price of workers in tight labor markets, resulting in restraint on nominal wage demands and contributing to the apparent decline in NAIRU.",1999-02-25
"Collectively, these factors--favorable supply shocks, a lower NAIRU and higher trend growth, and the gap between the unemployment and capacity utilization rates--can explain the combination of higher-than-expected growth, a decline in the unemployment rate well below previous estimates of NAIRU, and lower-than-expected inflation.",1999-02-25
"Nevertheless, the relative importance of the various factors and uncertainty about their relative importance have important implications for monetary policy.",1999-02-25
"If increased worker insecurity, as a result of rapid technological change and globalization, has been important in lowering NAIRU and improving the inflation-unemployment trade-off in the U.S., why isn't this force having a similar effect in the U.K.?",1999-02-25
"If more rapid technological change is raising productivity growth in the U.S., why does the discussion here seem to be focused on whether or not there has been a decline in trend productivity growth?",1999-02-25
"Is there any indication in the U.K. of a divergence between unemployment and capacity utilization rates, as experienced in the U.S?",1999-02-25
"Finally, if supply shocks and currency appreciation lower inflation in the U.S., allowing the economy to move temporarily beyond the point of sustainable capacity without inflationary consequences, why isn't the same true of the U.K, which itself has experienced falling commodity prices and a rising currency?",1999-02-25
"For example, is the current state of labor market tightness sustainable, without rising inflation, once the recent favorable supply shocks dissipate?",1999-02-25
"Is the current level of equity prices sustainable, without further declines in real interest rates and under the assumption of some slowing in growth toward trend going forward?",1999-02-25
Is the prevailing and still widening current account deficit sustainable or does it carry important risks to U.S. interest rates and exchange rates going forward?,1999-02-25
"The consensus forecast, for example, continues to project a slowdown to below-trend growth, resulting in a gradual increase in unemployment.",1999-02-25
"The FOMC's central tendency forecast, released earlier this week in the semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins report, projects growth in the 2 ½% - 3% range and a nearly unchanged unemployment rate--still a slowdown, but only to trend growth.",1999-02-25
Both the consensus and FOMC forecasts projects higher inflation.,1999-02-25
"However, the increase in inflation is principally a result of the dissipation of the direct effects of recent favorable supply shocks.",1999-02-25
"As a result, overall CPI inflation converges to recent core inflation.",1999-02-25
"Because the effects of recent declines in inflation are still working through the wage-price process, nominal wage demands are likely to be restrained going forward, at least for a while.",1999-02-25
"As a result, core measures of inflation are expected to remain well contained and nearly unchanged over 1999.",1999-02-25
"The most recent inflation data continue to appear consistent with this expectation, showing no signs of any rebound in core inflation.",1999-02-25
The Challenges Facing U.S. Monetary Policy I now turn to the challenge of designing a strategy for monetary policy in light of uncertainties both about the sources of recent performance and about the outlook going forward.,1999-02-25
Implications of Supply Shocks and Structural Change for Monetary Policy The relative importance of supply shocks and structural change has important implications for monetary policy.,1999-02-25
"For example, if the recent exceptional U.S. economic performance were entirely due to the temporary effects of favorable supply shocks, the economy's level of production might be interpreted as being beyond its sustainable capacity, with the inflationary consequences temporarily suppressed by the favorable supply shocks.",1999-02-25
"The challenge for monetary policy would be to make the transition from the current exceptional but unsustainable state to a less exceptional but more sustainable one, prior to the supply shocks fully dissipating.",1999-02-25
"On the other hand, if the recent performance is accounted for entirely by supply-enhancing structural changes and, therefore, reflects the new, more favorable performance characteristics of the U.S. economy, the role of monetary policy is to accommodate this more favorable performance rather than to constrain it.",1999-02-25
"The challenge is to set a strategy that respects this uncertainty, takes advantages of opportunities for better performance, while mitigating the risks of overtaxing the limits of sustainable production and growth.",1999-02-25
Monetary Policy Strategy: Principles and Practice Let me now turn to how U.S. monetary policy has responded during this episode and to the challenges that it faces going forward.,1999-02-25
I will describe the evolution of monetary policy in relation to the strategy embodied in the Taylor Rule.,1999-02-25
The Taylor Rule prescribes movements in real interest rates in response to deviations of inflation from the policymakers' inflation target and to deviations of output from its long-run potential (or to deviations in the unemployment rate from its natural rate).,1999-02-25
These responses impose what I believe are the two key ingredients for a disciplined monetary policy strategy: a nominal anchor (via the inflation target) and a policy that leans against cyclical winds (via the response to changes in resource utilization rates).,1999-02-25
"During most of the recent episode, monetary policy broadly followed the Taylor Rule prescription, while holding the nominal federal funds rate about unchanged.",1999-02-25
"Since 1995, the simultaneous declines in the unemployment rate (as a result of faster than expected growth) and lower-than-expected inflation had almost perfectly offsetting effects on the target nominal federal funds rate.",1999-02-25
"The drop in the unemployment rate outweighed the fall in inflation in terms of the prescription for real rates, but the higher real federal funds rate prescribed by the Taylor Rule was achieved passively via declines in inflation, without the need for an increase in nominal funds rate.",1999-02-25
"More recently, however, monetary policy has significantly departed from the Taylor Rule prescription.",1999-02-25
"That is, the nominal funds rate today is lower than could be justified by typical Taylor Rules, given prevailing inflation and labor utilization rates.",1999-02-25
This was intended to ensure that monetary policy and overall financial conditions remained consistent with a forecast of a benign slowdown in U.S. growth.,1999-02-25
"Specifically, even at prevailing financial conditions, weaker foreign growth threatened to transform what was otherwise expected to be a benign slowdown into one that might be excessive, particularly given what also appeared to be asymmetrical downside risks in the global economy.",1999-02-25
"But a forward-looking version of the Taylor Rule did, in my view, justify the policy action, at least given the revision in my own expectations for growth going forward.",1999-02-25
"The third development is the reduced confidence of some (not including yours truly) in the traditional model of inflation dynamics and the appreciation by nearly everyone of increased uncertainty about the estimate of NAIRU, in response to the persistence of faster-than-expected growth and lower-than-expected inflation.",1999-02-25
The first question is whether the degree of easing implemented in response to financial market turbulence and the abrupt downward revision in the forecast should be reassessed in light of the subsequent improvement in financial conditions and the continued robustness of domestic demand.,1999-02-25
"Such a reassessment would, of course, also have to take into account both the incoming data on inflation and the downside risks to the U.S. economy, including those related to the continuing stresses in the global economy.",1999-02-25
"In effect, uncertainty about NAIRU can be interpreted as having made monetary policy reluctant to move on the basis of declines in the unemployment rate relative to some given estimate of NAIRU.",1999-02-25
"While this could be rationalized as an appropriate response to uncertainty about the level of NAIRU, such a strategy positions monetary policy to accommodate continued above-trend growth and further increases in labor market tightness with faster money growth, in order to preserve the prevailing level of nominal federal funds rate.",1999-02-25
"This would result in a monetary policy that reinforced rather than leaned against the cyclical winds, at least until actual price data confirmed that NAIRU had been passed.",1999-02-25
"Given that the unemployment rate is now so low relative to the range of estimates of NAIRU, and given the long lags between policy actions and the effect on inflation, continuing such an accommodative strategy would run a substantial risk of unleashing inflation pressures that would be disruptive to reverse.",1999-02-25
"This may not be an issue going forward, however, given that both the consensus and FOMC forecasts project a slowing to or below trend growth and therefore no further tightening in labor markets.",1999-02-25
"Given the progress that has been made in reducing inflation, and the very solid economic performance that this low-inflation environment has helped to promote, a new set of issues is now emerging on the policy agenda.",1998-01-03
Of mounting importance is a deeper understanding of the economic characteristics of sustained price stability.,1998-01-03
We central bankers need also to better judge how to assess our performance in achieving and maintaining that objective in light of the uncertainties surrounding the accuracy of our measured price indexes.,1998-01-03
"Prices of goods and services set in those markets are central guides to the efficient allocation of resources in a market economy, along with interest rates and equity values.",1998-01-03
"Prices are the signals through which tastes and technology affect the decisions of consumers and producers, directing resources toward their highest valued use.",1998-01-03
"Of course, this signaling process, which involves individual prices, would work with or without government statistical agencies that measure aggregate price levels, and in this sense, price measurement probably is not fundamental for the overall efficiency of the market economy.",1998-01-03
"Indeed, vibrant market economies existed long before government agencies were established to measure prices.",1998-01-03
"Nonetheless, in a modern monetary economy, accurate measurement of aggregate price levels is of considerable importance, increasingly so for central banks whose mandate is to maintain financial stability.",1998-01-03
"Accurate price measures are necessary for understanding economic developments, not only involving inflation, but also involving real output and productivity.",1998-01-03
"If the general price level is estimated to be rising more rapidly than is in fact the case, then we are simultaneously understating growth in real GDP and productivity, and real incomes and living standards are rising faster than our published data suggest.",1998-01-03
"Under these circumstances, policymakers must be cognizant of the shortcomings of our published price indexes to avoid actions based on inaccurate premises that will provoke undesired consequences.",1998-01-03
"Clearly, central bankers need to be conscious of the problems of price measurement as we gauge policies designed to promote price stability and maximum sustainable economic growth.",1998-01-03
"Moreover, many economic transactions, both private and public, are explicitly tied to movements in some published price index, most commonly a consumer price index; and some transactions that are not explicitly tied to a published price index may, nevertheless, take such an index into account less formally.",1998-01-03
"If the price index is not accurately measuring what the participants in such transactions believe it is measuring, then economic transactions will lead to suboptimal outcomes.",1998-01-03
The remarkable progress that has been made by virtually all of the major industrial countries in achieving low rates of inflation in recent years has brought the issue of price measurement into especially sharp focus.,1998-01-03
"For most purposes, biases of a few tenths in annual inflation rates do not matter when inflation is high.",1998-01-03
"They do matter when, as now, inflation has become so low that policymakers need to consider at what point effective price stability has been reached.",1998-01-03
One use of the term refers to an ongoing fall in the prices of existing assets.,1998-01-03
"Asset prices are inherently volatile, in part because expected returns from real assets can vary for a wide variety of reasons, some of which may be only tangentially related to the state of the economy and monetary policy.",1998-01-03
"Nonetheless, a drop in the prices of existing assets can feed back onto real economic activity, not only by changing incentives to consume and invest, but also by impairing the health of financial intermediaries--as we experienced in the early 1990s and many Asian countries are learning now.",1998-01-03
"But historically, it has been very rapid asset price declines--in equity and real estate, especially--that have held the potential to be a virulently negative force in the economy.",1998-01-03
"I emphasize rapid declines because, in most circumstances, slowly deflating asset prices probably can be absorbed without the marked economic disruptions that frequently accompany sharp corrections.",1998-01-03
"The severe economic contraction of the early 1930s, and the associated persistent declines in product prices, could probably not have occurred apart from the steep asset price deflation that started in 1929.",1998-01-03
"While asset price deflation can occur for a number of reasons, a persistent deflation in the prices of currently produced goods and services--just like a persistent increase in these prices--necessarily is, at its root, a monetary phenomenon.",1998-01-03
"Just as changes in monetary conditions that involve a flight from money to goods cause inflation, the onset of deflation involves a flight from goods to money.",1998-01-03
Both rapid or variable inflation and deflation can lead to a state of fear and uncertainty that is associated with significant increases in risk premiums and corresponding shortfalls in economic activity.,1998-01-03
"Even a moderate rate of inflation can hamper economic performance, as I have emphasized many times before; and although we do not have any recent experience, moderate rates of deflation would most probably lead to similar problems.",1998-01-03
"Deflation, like inflation, would distort resource allocation and interfere with the economy's ability to reach its full potential.",1998-01-03
"It would have these effects by making long-term planning difficult, obscuring the true movements of relative prices, and interacting adversely with institutions like the tax system that function on the basis on nominal values.",1998-01-03
But deflation can be detrimental for reasons that go beyond those that are also associated with inflation.,1998-01-03
"Nominal interest rates are bounded at zero, hence deflation raises the possibility of potentially significant increases in real interest rates.",1998-01-03
"Some also argue that resistance to nominal wage cuts will impart an upward bias to real wages as price stability approaches or outright deflation occurs, leaving the economy with a potentially higher level of unemployment in equilibrium.",1998-01-03
"A deflation that took place in an environment of rapid productivity growth, however, might be largely immune from some of these special problems.",1998-01-03
"For example, in the high-tech sector of our economy today, we observe falling prices together with rapid investment and high profitability.",1998-01-03
"Although real interest rates may be quite high in terms of this sector's declining product prices, rapid productivity growth has ensured that real rates of return are higher still, and investment in this sector has been robust.",1998-01-03
"In this sense, the choice of a specific, sometimes arbitrary, definition of real output and hence of price by government statisticians is essentially a descriptive issue, and not one that directly affects firms' investment decisions.",1998-01-03
This is an illustration of where even individual price measurement probably is not always of direct and fundamental importance for private sector behavior.,1998-01-03
"If such high-tech, high-productivity-growth firms produce an increasing share of output in the decades ahead, then, one could readily imagine the economy experiencing an overall product price deflation in which the problems associated with a zero constraint on nominal interest rates or nominal wage changes would seldom be binding.",1998-01-03
"Nevertheless, even if we could ensure significantly more rapid productivity growth than we have seen recently, there are valid reasons for wishing to avoid ongoing declines in the general price level.",1998-01-03
"If increases in both inflation and deflation raise risk premiums and retard growth, it follows that risk premiums are lowest at price stability.",1998-01-03
"Furthermore, price stability, by reducing variation in uncertainty about the future, should also reduce variations in asset values.",1998-01-03
But how are we to know when our objective of price stability has been achieved?,1998-01-03
"In price measurement, a distinction must be made between the measurement of individual prices, on the one hand, and the aggregation of those prices into indexes of the overall price level on the other.",1998-01-03
"The notion of what we mean by a general price level--or more relevantly, its change--is never unambiguously defined.",1998-01-03
"But it is the measurement of individual prices, not their aggregation, that pose the most difficult conceptual issues.",1998-01-03
"At first glance, observing and measuring prices might not appear especially daunting.",1998-01-03
But dividing that nominal value change into components representing changes in real quantity versus price requires that one define a unit of output that is to remain constant in all transactions over time.,1998-01-03
"Defining such a constant-quality unit of output, of course, is the central conceptual difficulty in price measurement.",1998-01-03
"Consequently, its price can be compared over time with a degree of precision adequate for virtually all producers and consumers of aluminum ingot.",1998-01-03
"Similarly, the prices of a ton of cold rolled steel sheet, or of a linear yard of cotton broad woven fabric, can be reasonably compared over a period of years.",1998-01-03
"But when the characteristics of products and services are changing rapidly, defining the unit of output, and thereby adjusting an item's price for improvements in quality, can be exceptionally difficult.",1998-01-03
"These problems are becoming pervasive in modern economies as high tech and service prices, which are generally more difficult to measure, become ever more prominent in aggregate price measures.",1998-01-03
The continual introduction of new goods and services onto the markets creates special challenges for price measurement.,1998-01-03
"The area of medical care, where technology is changing in ways that make techniques of only a decade ago seem archaic, provides some particularly striking illustrations of the difficulties involved in measuring quality-adjusted prices.",1998-01-03
"How, then, will we measure inflation in the future if our measurement techniques become increasingly obsolete?",1998-01-03
"We must keep in mind that, difficult as the problem seems, consistently measured prices do exist in principle.",1998-01-03
"Embodied in all products is some unit of output, and hence of price, that is recognizable to those who buy and sell the product if not to the outside observer.",1998-01-03
"Furthermore, so long as people continue to exchange nominal interest rate debt instruments and contract for future payments in terms of dollars or other currencies, there must be a presumption about the future purchasing power of money no matter how complex individual products become.",1998-01-03
"Market participants do have a sense of the aggregate price level and how they expect it to change over time, and these views must be embedded in the value of financial assets.",1998-01-03
"The emergence of inflation-indexed bonds, while providing us with useful information, does not solve the problem of ascertaining an economically meaningful measure of the general price level.",1998-01-03
"By necessity, the total return on indexed bonds must be tied to forecasts of specific published price indexes, which may or may not reflect the market's judgment of the future purchasing power of money.",1998-01-03
"To the extent they do not, of course, the implicit real interest rate is biased in the opposite direction.",1998-01-03
"Moreover, we are, as yet, unable to separate compensation for inflation risk from compensation for expected inflation.",1998-01-03
"Eventually, financial markets may develop the instruments and associated analytical techniques for unearthing these implicit changes in the general price level with some precision.",1998-01-03
"In those circumstances, then--at least for purposes of monetary policy--these measures could obviate the more traditional approaches to aggregate price measurement now employed.",1998-01-03
"They may help us understand, for example, whether markets perceive the true change in aggregate prices to reflect fixed or variable weight indexes of the components, or whether arithmetic or logarithmic weighting of the components is more appropriate.",1998-01-03
"But, for the foreseeable future, we shall have to rely on our statistical agencies to produce the price data necessary to assess economic performance and to make economic policy.",1998-01-03
This technique associates changes in a product's price with changes in product characteristics.,1998-01-03
The issues surrounding the appropriate measurement of computer prices also illustrate some of the difficulties of valuing goods and services when there are significant interactions among users of the products.,1998-01-03
"Therefore, even in the case of personal computers, where we have made such great strides in measuring quality changes, I suspect that important phenomena still may not be adequately captured by our published price indexes.",1998-01-03
"Despite the advances in price measurement that have been made over the years, there remains considerable room for improvement.",1998-01-03
"As you know, a group of experts empaneled by the Senate Finance Committee--the Boskin commission--concluded that the consumer price index has overstated changes in the cost of living by roughly one percentage point per annum in recent years.",1998-01-03
"About half of this bias owed to inadequate adjustment for quality improvement and the introduction of new goods, and about half reflected the manner in which the individual prices were aggregated.",1998-01-03
"Recent work by staff economists at the Federal Reserve Board has added corroborating evidence of price mismeasurement, using a macroeconomic approach that is essentially independent of the microstatistical exercises.",1998-01-03
"Specifically, employing disaggregated data from the national income and product accounts, this research finds that the measured growth of real output and productivity in the service sector is implausibly weak, given that the return to owners of businesses in that sector apparently has been well-maintained.",1998-01-03
"Much more reasonable is the view that prices have been mismeasured, and that the true quality-adjusted prices have been rising more slowly than the published price indexes.",1998-01-03
"Properly measured, output and productivity trends in these service industries are doubtless considerably stronger than suggested by the published data.",1998-01-03
"Assuming, for example, no change in the productivity levels for these industries in recent years would imply a price bias consistent with the Boskin commission findings.",1998-01-03
"The information revolution, which lies behind so much of the rapid technological change that makes prices difficult to measure, will surely play an important role in helping our statistical agencies acquire the necessary speed and agility to better capture the changes taking place in our economies.",1998-01-03
But the possibilities offered by information technology for the improvement of price measurement may turn out to be much broader in scope.,1998-01-03
"To simplify a complex history, earlier attempts to stabilize the monetary arrangements of the United States had frequently been roiled by perceived conflicts of interest between (on the one hand) the farmers and tradespeople of Main Street America, who believed that they were most advantaged by policies of easy credit, and (on the other hand) the financial barons of Wall Street, who, as creditors and bondholders, preferred ""hard-money,"" low-inflation policies.",2006-02-24
"When the System was founded, its principal legal purpose was to provide ""an elastic currency,"" by which was meant a supply of credit that could fluctuate as needed to meet seasonal and other changes in credit demand.",2006-02-24
"The seasonal fluctuations that had characterized short-term interest rates before the founding of the Fed were almost immediately eliminated, removing a source of stress from the banking system and the economy.1 The Federal Reserve today retains important responsibilities for banking and financial stability, but its formal policy objectives have become much broader.",2006-02-24
"Its current mandate, set formally in law in 1977 and reaffirmed in 2000, requires the Federal Reserve to pursue three objectives through its conduct of monetary policy: maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.",2006-02-24
One of my goals today is to consider the relationships among the three apparently disparate objectives of monetary policy.,2006-02-24
"In particular, I will argue for what I believe has become the consensus view, that the mandated goals of price stability and maximum employment are almost entirely complementary.",2006-02-24
"Central bankers, economists, and other knowledgeable observers around the world agree that price stability both contributes importantly to the economy's growth and employment prospects in the longer term and moderates the variability of output and employment in the short to medium term.",2006-02-24
"Notably, during the 1960s and early 1970s, some policymakers appeared to believe that price stability and high employment were substitutes, not complements.",2006-02-24
"Specifically, some influential voices of the time argued that, by accepting higher inflation, policymakers could bring about a permanently lower rate of unemployment.2 As I will discuss a bit later, the demise of the view that higher inflation promotes employment in favor of the modern consensus that low inflation and strong employment are complementary goals resulted from the constructive interplay between academic research and practical policymaking experience, an interplay that significantly improved policy outcomes and economic welfare in the United States.",2006-02-24
The Dual Role of Price StabilityPrice stability plays a dual role in modern central banking: It is both an end and a means of monetary policy.,2006-02-24
"As one of the Fed's mandated objectives, price stability itself is an end, or goal, of policy.",2006-02-24
"Fundamentally, price stability preserves the integrity and purchasing power of the nation's money.",2006-02-24
"When prices are stable, people can hold money for transactions and other purposes without having to worry that inflation will eat away at the real value of their money balances.",2006-02-24
"Equally important, stable prices allow people to rely on the dollar as a measure of value when making long-term contracts, engaging in long-term planning, or borrowing or lending for long periods.",2006-02-24
"As economist Martin Feldstein has frequently pointed out, price stability also permits tax laws, accounting rules, and the like to be expressed in dollar terms without being subject to distortions arising from fluctuations in the value of money.3 Economists like to argue that money belongs in the same class as the wheel and the inclined plane among ancient inventions of great social utility.",2006-02-24
Price stability allows that invention to work with minimal friction.,2006-02-24
"In principle, the problem of inflation could be reduced by the practice of indexing dollar payments such as interest and wages to the price level, but people seem to find indexing costly and avoid it when they can.",2006-02-24
"It is interesting and instructive, for example, that the indexation of wages to prices in labor contracts has always been quite limited in the United States; some indexation was used during the high-inflation 1970s but the practice has been substantially reduced since then.",2006-02-24
"Moreover, some countries that adopted indexing during high-inflation periods, such as Brazil and Israel, largely abandoned the practice when inflation receded.",2006-02-24
"Borrowers and lenders likewise seem to prefer to contract in dollar terms, although inflation-indexed financial instruments have gained wider acceptance in recent years.",2006-02-24
"The savings and loan crisis of the 1980s, which cost U.S. taxpayers roughly $150 billion, is an example of the kind of problem that can arise in the absence of price stability.",2006-02-24
"An important source of the S&L crisis was the unexpected inflation of the 1970s, which greatly reduced the real value of mortgage loans made by the S&Ls in an earlier, low-inflation era.",2006-02-24
"Although price stability is an end of monetary policy, it is also a means by which policy can achieve its other objectives.",2006-02-24
"In the jargon, price stability is both a goal and an intermediate target of policy.",2006-02-24
"As I will discuss, when prices are stable, both economic growth and stability are likely to be enhanced, and long-term interest rates are likely to be moderate.",2006-02-24
"Thus, even a policymaker who places relatively less weight on price stability as a goal in its own right should be careful to maintain price stability as a means of advancing other critical objectives.",2006-02-24
Let me elaborate briefly on the relationship between price stability and the other two goals of monetary policy.,2006-02-24
"First, price stability promotes efficiency and long-term growth by providing a monetary and financial environment in which economic decisions can be made and markets can operate without concern about unpredictable fluctuations in the purchasing power of money.",2006-02-24
"As I have already noted, the dollar provides a reasonably secure gauge of real economic values only when inflation is low and stable.",2006-02-24
"High and variable inflation degrades the quality of the signals coming from the price system, as producers and consumers find it difficult to distinguish price changes arising from changes in product supplies and demands from changes arising from general inflation.",2006-02-24
"Because prices constitute a market economy's fundamental means of conveying information, the increased noise associated with high inflation erodes the effectiveness of the market system.",2006-02-24
"High inflation also complicates long-term economic planning, creating incentives for households and firms to shorten their horizons and to spend resources in managing inflation risk rather than focusing on the most productive activities.",2006-02-24
Research is not definitive about the extent to which price stability enhances economic growth.,2006-02-24
"We do not have controlled experiments in macroeconomics, and inflation and growth are both endogenous variables that respond jointly to many factors.",2006-02-24
"Nevertheless, I am confident that the effect is positive and see the international experience as at least consistent with the view that, in combination with other sound policies, the maintenance of price stability has quite significant benefits for efficiency and growth.",2006-02-24
"That view appears to be widely shared among policymakers, as governments around the world have made extensive efforts to bring inflation down over the past two decades or so, with substantial success.",2006-02-24
"More recently, the evidence has mounted not only that low and stable inflation is beneficial for growth and employment in the long-term but also that it contributes importantly to greater stability of output and employment in the short to medium term.",2006-02-24
"Specifically, during the past twenty years or so, in the United States and other industrial countries the volatility of both inflation and output have significantly decreased--a phenomenon known to economists as the Great Moderation (Bernanke, 2004).",2006-02-24
"This finding challenges some conventional economic views, according to which greater stability of inflation can be achieved only by allowing greater fluctuations in output and employment.",2006-02-24
"The key to explaining why price stability promotes stability in both output and employment is the realization that, when inflation itself is well-controlled, then the public's expectations of inflation will also be low and stable.",2006-02-24
"In a virtuous circle, stable inflation expectations help the central bank to keep inflation low even as it retains substantial freedom to respond to disturbances to the broader economy.",2006-02-24
This mechanism can be illustrated by comparing the effects of the recent rise in oil prices to the effects of the oil price increases of the 1970s.,2006-02-24
"Thirty years ago, the public's expectations of inflation were not well anchored.",2006-02-24
"With little confidence that the Fed would keep inflation low and stable, the public at that time reacted to the oil price increases by anticipating that inflation would rise still further.",2006-02-24
"A destabilizing wage-price spiral ensued as firms and workers competed to ""keep up"" with inflation.",2006-02-24
"The Fed, attempting to gain control of the deteriorating inflation situation, raised interest rates sharply; however, initially at least, these increases proved insufficient to control inflation or inflation expectations, and they added substantially to the volatility of output and employment.",2006-02-24
"The episode highlights the crucial importance of keeping inflation expectations low and stable, which can be done only if inflation itself is low and stable.",2006-02-24
"By contrast, the oil price increases of recent years appear to have had only a limited effect on core inflation (that is, inflation in the prices of goods other than energy and food), nor do they appear to have generated significant macroeconomic volatility.",2006-02-24
"But, the crucial difference from the 1970s, in my view, is that today inflation expectations are low and stable (as shown, for example, by many surveys and a variety of financial indicators).",2006-02-24
"Oil price increases in the past few years, unlike in the 1970s, have not fed through to any great extent into longer-term inflation expectations and core inflation, as the public has shown confidence that any increases in inflation will be temporary and that, in the long run, inflation will remain low.",2006-02-24
"As a result, the Fed has not had to raise interest rates sharply as it did in the 1970s but instead has been able to pursue a policy that is more gradual and predictable.",2006-02-24
"Of course, the relatively benign state of inflation expectations we enjoy today has not come automatically.",2006-02-24
"The anchoring of inflation expectations in a narrow range has been the product of Fed policies that have kept actual inflation low in recent years, clear communication of those policies, and an institutional commitment to price stability.",2006-02-24
"Price stability also contributes to the third component of the Fed's mandate, the objective of moderate long-term interest rates.",2006-02-24
"As first pointed out by the economist Irving Fisher, interest rates will tend to move in tandem with changes in expected inflation, as lenders require compensation for the loss in purchasing power of their principal over the period of the loan.",2006-02-24
"When inflation is expected to be low, lenders will require less compensation, and thus interest rates will tend to be low as well.",2006-02-24
"In addition, because price stability and the associated macroeconomic stability reduce the risks of holding long-term bonds and other securities, price stability may also reduce the premiums that lenders charge for bearing risk, lowering the overall level of rates.",2006-02-24
"The Origins of the Modern Consensus on Price StabilityI have briefly laid out the modern consensus that price stability, besides being desirable in itself, tends also to increase economic growth and stability.",2006-02-24
"At that time, the ascendant paradigm was that society faced a long-term tradeoff between price stability and high employment.",2006-02-24
"The 1960s' idea that greater prosperity could be achieved if only we were willing to accept higher inflation had its origins in an academic study, although the author likely did not intend that outcome.",2006-02-24
"Phillips, using British data, showed that historically inflation had tended to be high in years in which unemployment was low.",2006-02-24
"In the decade following the publication of his paper, his empirical finding was sometimes interpreted (including, for example, by members of the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations) as showing that policymakers could choose (permanently) lower unemployment if they were willing to accept (permanently) higher inflation in exchange.",2006-02-24
"Scholars disagree somewhat about the extent to which policymakers of the time tried actively to take advantage of this supposed tradeoff, but these ideas likely provided part of the intellectual rationale that made the authorities willing to allow inflation to rise throughout the 1960s and in the early 1970s.",2006-02-24
"Their key contribution was to observe that, if inflation expectations react to changes in actual inflation in an economically reasonable way, then any tradeoff between inflation and unemployment would be short-lived at best.",2006-02-24
"To illustrate their argument, let us suppose that firms and workers set nominal wages once a year but that, sometime during the year, the prices of firms' output rise unexpectedly as a result of stronger-than-expected demand.",2006-02-24
"The combination of higher prices for their output and fixed nominal wages would raise the profitability of increasing production; thus, assuming that more workers are available at the previously fixed wage, firms would respond to the rise in prices by adding workers.",2006-02-24
"Over a short period, then, higher inflation might bring lower unemployment, consistent with the empirical results found by Phillips.",2006-02-24
"However, this logic applies only during the period in which wages and workers' expectations of inflation are fixed.",2006-02-24
"If inflation were to rise persistently, Friedman and Phelps argued, workers' expectations of inflation would not remain unchanged but would adjust to match the actual rate of inflation.",2006-02-24
Higher inflation expectations would in turn lead workers to bargain for commensurate raises in nominal wages to preserve the real value of their earnings.,2006-02-24
"With nominal wages rising as well as prices, firms would no longer have an incentive to hire additional workers, and employment would return to its normal level.",2006-02-24
"An attempt to stimulate the economy by choosing a permanently higher level of inflation could thus not succeed, according to this analysis; such an attempt would leave the economy with higher inflation but a level of employment no different than it would have been otherwise.",2006-02-24
"In particular, among the seminal contributions of the Friedman and Phelps analyses was the identification of the key role of inflation expectations in determining the behavior of the economy, a point that remains central to our thinking today.",2006-02-24
"The inflationary policies of the 1960s led not to permanently lower unemployment, as the permanent-tradeoff theory predicted, but instead to persistently higher inflation with no improvement in unemployment.",2006-02-24
"For example, in the 1970s, core inflation averaged 6 percent, compared with 2-1/4 percent in the 1960s, and unemployment in the 1970s averaged 6-1/4 percent, compared with the 4-3/4 percent rate in the 1960s.",2006-02-24
"The volatility of output and (especially) inflation both increased, as the Fed struggled to contain inflation expectations.",2006-02-24
"Other factors, including the aforementioned surge in oil prices, played a role in the deterioration of economic performance in the 1970s.",2006-02-24
"Clearly, though, the theory that a long-run tradeoff exists between inflation and unemployment had sprung a serious leak.",2006-02-24
"Despite a growing recognition that higher inflation provided no labor-market benefits, there was, until the end of the 1970s, little appetite for taking the actions necessary to reduce inflation.",2006-02-24
"For one thing, economists and policymakers recognized that reversing the rise in inflation expectations that had occurred during the 1970s could take time and that, during the process, the nation could suffer ultimately transitory but still-serious increases in unemployment.",2006-02-24
"Furthermore, at the time, it was widely believed among economists that any stable level of inflation would be as good as another.",2006-02-24
"Although the efficiency costs associated with high inflation were acknowledged, the costs were thought to be associated mostly with changes in the underlying rate of inflation--particularly unexpected changes.",2006-02-24
"In addition, many economists argued that the efficiency costs of inflation were not particularly large.5 Milton Friedman once again was in the vanguard on this issue.",2006-02-24
"In his 1977 Nobel Prize address, Friedman laid out the modern argument--that, because it harms the efficient operation of markets, high inflation is more likely to raise unemployment than to lower it--and he used the experience of the 1970s to illustrate his point.6 Indeed, by the late 1970s, even economists who were not part of Friedman's monetarist circle were beginning to study and acknowledge the costs to the economy associated with high inflation.7 When Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker embarked on his campaign to break the back of U.S. inflation in October 1979, he drew on this existing work in formulating and defending his program.",2006-02-24
"In his first testimonies and speeches after becoming Chairman, Volcker emphasized many of the arguments developed by academics for how inflation interfered with the efficient working of the economy.",2006-02-24
"And he drew on Friedman's monetarist approach, both in its advocacy of low and stable inflation and in its prescriptions for policy implementation.",2006-02-24
"In a speech given just after the Federal Open Market Committee announced its adoption of a monetarist-style policy approach in October 1979, Volcker dismissed the notion that lowering inflation meant accepting permanently higher unemployment and suggested instead that the reverse was more likely to be the case.8 Until this point, academic research (or at least some of it) had paved the way for improved policymaking.",2006-02-24
Volcker's statements from this period in particular are remarkable in the extent to which they anticipate contemporary thinking about the crucial importance of low and stable inflation and inflation expectations.,2006-02-24
"He repeatedly noted, for example, how instability in inflation and inflation expectations were ""jeopardizing the orderly functioning of financial and commodity markets.",2006-02-24
"Under the Volcker-led Federal Reserve, annual core inflation fell from more than 9 percent in 1980 to just below 4 percent in 1987.",2006-02-24
"Alan Greenspan, who succeeded Volcker as Fed Chairman in 1987, continued to work to stabilize inflation and inflation expectations.",2006-02-24
"Under Greenspan, the Federal Reserve gradually brought core inflation down further, to about 2 percent in recent years.",2006-02-24
"The Greenspan era also saw important steps toward increased transparency at the Federal Reserve, which helped to clarify for the public the Federal Reserve's strong institutional commitment to price stability.",2006-02-24
"In a sense, Chairman Greenspan had the harder sell: As an economist would say, we might expect diminishing marginal returns to inflation reduction.",2006-02-24
"Lower inflation has been accompanied by inflation expectations that are not only lower but better anchored, so far as we can tell.",2006-02-24
"Most striking, Greenspan's tenure aligns closely with the Great Moderation, the reduction in economic volatility I mentioned earlier, as well as with a strong revival in U.S. productivity growth--developments that had many sources, no doubt, but that were supported, in my view, by monetary stability.",2006-02-24
"Like Volcker, Greenspan was ahead of academic thinking in recognizing the potential benefits of increased price stability.",2006-02-24
"Indeed, in recent years, academic research on monetary policy has caught up with the policymakers, providing new support for what I have termed the modern consensus, that price stability supports both strong growth and stability in output and employment.",2006-02-24
ConclusionPrice stability plays a dual role in monetary policy.,2006-02-24
Stable prices are desirable in themselves and thus are an important goal of monetary policy.,2006-02-24
"But stable prices are also a prerequisite to the achievement of the Federal Reserve's other mandated objectives, high employment and moderate long-term interest rates.",2006-02-24
"In particular, low and stable inflation and inflation expectations enhance both economic growth and economic stability.",2006-02-24
The complementarity of price stability with the other goals of monetary policy is now the consensus view among economists and central bankers.,2006-02-24
"Measured on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis, it appears that GDP advanced around 3% and prices, measured by the chain price index for GDP, increased just above 2%.",1997-01-16
"Inflation in 1996, measured by the chain price index for GDP or the core CPI, was the lowest in 30 years.",1997-01-16
"Last year was the fifth consecutive year that inflation, measured by the chain GDP price index, was 2.6% or lower and the 5-year compound annual inflation rate is now 2.5%, the lowest since 1967.",1997-01-16
"The extraordinary achievement of 1996, of course, was reaching such low levels of unemployment and inflation at the same time.",1997-01-16
The 5.4% unemployment rate in 1996 was the lowest annual rate since 1988 and before that since 1973.,1997-01-16
"Specifically, the surprise was a decline in measures of core inflation for consumer and producer goods and in the inflation rate for the GDP price index during a year when the unemployment rate declined and averaged more than 1/2 percentage point below levels that in the past had been associated with stable inflation.",1997-01-16
"In the second half of the year, growth slowed, the unemployment rate stabilized, and inflation remained well contained.",1997-01-16
"As a result, the consensus forecast projects growth near trend and relatively stable inflation and unemployment rates.",1997-01-16
The business cycle is not dead and monetary policy is certain to be challenged again.,1997-01-16
"At the moment, trend growth near full employment appears to be a reasonable prospect in the year ahead.",1997-01-16
"In particular, there remains some uncertainty as to whether the current unemployment rate will prove consistent with stable inflation over time and we need to pay some attention to the challenge of how we approach our longer-term goal of achieving and maintaining price stability.",1997-01-16
"Since joining the Board, I have tried to continue this approach, focusing in particular on the forces behind the extraordinary macroeconomic performance over the past several years and their implications for the outlook and monetary policy.",2000-10-19
"My story this morning has five chapters on how the economy and monetary policy have adjusted, and must continue to adjust, to the acceleration of productivity and to the oil and other relative-price price shocks that have been so important in shaping macroeconomic performance since the mid-1990s.",2000-10-19
"In chapter 1, I identify the short-run effects of higher productivity growth--specifically, the effects on aggregate demand and on inflation--and assess the implications of these two effects for the conduct of monetary policy.",2000-10-19
"In chapter 2, I note the favorable choice that confronts policymakers as the economy adjusts to an acceleration in productivity--the choice between temporarily lower unemployment, lower inflation, or some combination--and explain how the response of monetary policy determines this choice.",2000-10-19
That leads me directly to chapter 3 and my interpretation of recent monetary policy strategy.,2000-10-19
"In chapter 4, I discuss a transition to a period of slower growth and possibly higher inflation, a transition that in all likelihood we will make at some point.",2000-10-19
I interpret this as part of the continuing adjustment to the acceleration in productivity growth and part of the convergence to sustainable utilization and inflation rates.,2000-10-19
"In my final chapter, I turn to how the swings in oil prices have interacted with the acceleration in productivity to shape recent economic performance.",2000-10-19
"The effect of both of these shocks on inflation could reverse, and the balance between them could then turn out to be a powerful influence on the performance of the economy.",2000-10-19
"But it is fair to say that the views presented here are not part of the conventional wisdom, in part because a consensus has not yet been reached about the short-run effects of an acceleration in productivity.",2000-10-19
The Short-run Effects of an Acceleration in Productivity Growth We do not have many opportunities to learn about how the economy responds to major accelerations or decelerations in productivity.,2000-10-19
Figure 1 depicts the pattern in trend productivity growth from the 1960s to the first half of 2000.,2000-10-19
Trend productivity growth is an estimate of how productivity growth would evolve in the absence of cyclical swings in output and employment.,2000-10-19
"As you can see in figure 1, trend productivity growth in the early 1970s slowed from a 3 percent rate over the previous decade to about a 1-1/2 percent pace and remained at this lower rate until the mid-1990s.",2000-10-19
"At that point, productivity sharply accelerated.",2000-10-19
The figure undoubtedly overstates the abruptness of the decline in the early 1970s and the constancy of trend productivity on either side of this point and oversimplifies the pattern of acceleration since the mid-1990s.,2000-10-19
In figure 1 the pattern of acceleration is simply a straight line from the earlier period of low productivity growth to an upper-end estimate of trend productivity today.,2000-10-19
But the important message in both figures is that there have been two dramatic and persistent changes in trend productivity growth during the postwar period--the deceleration in the early 1970s and the acceleration in the mid-1990s.,2000-10-19
Economists don't agree yet on how much productivity has accelerated.,2000-10-19
Estimates among private forecasters of trend productivity growth cluster in a range of 2-1/2 percent to 2-3/4 percent with the upper end in the neighborhood of 3 percent to 3-1/2 percent.,2000-10-19
"The upper-end estimate would be consistent with an increase in potential output growth to about 4 percent to 4-1/2 percent, compared with potential output growth of about 2-1/2 percent prior to this acceleration.",2000-10-19
"The principal sources of the recent acceleration in productivity appear to be the information technology revolution, the related more rapid decline in the relative price of computers and communication equipment, and the resulting surge in capital spending that has raised the growth of capital services relative to that of labor.",2000-10-19
"Because we have little experience with major and persistent decelerations or accelerations in trend productivity, economists have not arrived at any consensus on how the economy responds to them.",2000-10-19
"In the case of a sustained increase in productivity growth, it is obvious that the long-run effects include a higher sustainable rate of growth in output.",2000-10-19
"Economic theory also suggests that, all else equal, the equilibrium real interest rate will increase.",2000-10-19
But there is less agreement about the shorter-run effects of an acceleration in productivity.,2000-10-19
"This experience, in my view, points to two key short-run macroeconomic consequences of an acceleration in productivity: the demand effect and the direct disinflationary effect.",2000-10-19
"I should note that both of these effects remain as open, empirical questions.1 Although these influences may be temporary, they can dominate the economic outlook for a number of years following an acceleration in productivity.",2000-10-19
"While the persistent effect of acceleration in productivity is a higher rate of sustainable growth, the short-run effects appear to have added a temporary bonus that, in my view, has contributed importantly to the truly exceptional performance over the last several years.",2000-10-19
"Specifically, they added to the increase in growth in real activity and were the source of simultaneous declines in unemployment and core inflation during much of this period.",2000-10-19
These developments have created a powerful set of crosscurrents that challenge monetary policymakers.,2000-10-19
The demand effect refers to the stimulus to aggregate demand from the forces that underlie the acceleration in productivity.,2000-10-19
"The boom was triggered by the profitable opportunities associated with exploiting the new technologies, by the associated declines in the relative prices of high-tech equipment, and by the decline in the cost of financing high-tech investments as a result of higher equity prices.",2000-10-19
The information technology revolution also set off a consumption boom triggered by the wealth effect associated with higher equity prices and by a projected higher path of labor income.,2000-10-19
"Recent experience suggests that this surge in demand may, at least for a while, overwhelm the increase in potential output growth, resulting in a steady decline in the unemployment rate.",2000-10-19
"At the same time, an acceleration in productivity also appears to have a direct disinflationary effect.",2000-10-19
"This arises, in my view, because of an asymmetry in the response of wages and prices to the acceleration in productivity, perhaps because salaries and wages are typically adjusted only once a year or, perhaps because of wage norms that cause employees to expect compensation growth similar to the experience over previous years.",2000-10-19
"Whatever the reason, nominal wages initially do not appear to respond very much to the acceleration in productivity.",2000-10-19
"As a result, the higher productivity lowers the cost of production.",2000-10-19
"This has the immediate effect of raising profits, but competition soon puts downward pressure on prices, lowering inflation.",2000-10-19
"The lower inflation, in turn, restrains nominal wage demands, contributing for a time to a virtuous cycle of lower wage change and price inflation.",2000-10-19
The demand and direct disinflationary effects have conflicting implications for inflation.,2000-10-19
"The above-trend growth associated with the demand effect lowers the unemployment rate, and the tighter labor market puts upward pressure on inflation.",2000-10-19
"The direct disinflationary effect, on the other hand, lowers inflation for any given unemployment rate.",2000-10-19
"The net effect could be steady, rising, or falling inflation--depending on whether productivity continues to accelerate and on how low the unemployment rate is driven in the process.",2000-10-19
"And, of course, the appropriate course of monetary policy depends on the balance between these two effects.2 The interaction of these two short-run effects can also be explained in terms of the relationship between the unemployment rate and the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU).",2000-10-19
The NAIRU is the unemployment rate consistent with steady inflation.,2000-10-19
"In computing the NAIRU, the customary practice is to abstract from shocks that directly affect inflation over and above the influence of demand pressure--for example, accelerations or decelerations in trend productivity and swings in the relative price of oil are not taken into consideration.",2000-10-19
"In fact, if there were no shocks, the direction of inflation ultimately would be uniquely determined by the relationship between the unemployment rate and the NAIRU.",2000-10-19
"But, of course, additional shocks almost always directly affect inflation, most often on the supply side of the economy.",2000-10-19
"One, therefore, must take into account both the demand pressures captured by the relationship between the unemployment rate and the NAIRU and supply shocks.",2000-10-19
"Because an acceleration in productivity initially lowers inflation for any given unemployment rate, it also lowers the unemployment rate consistent with steady inflation in the near term.",2000-10-19
"That is, the direct disinflationary effect lowers the short-run NAIRU relative to its long-run value.",2000-10-19
Whether or not inflation will rise or fall in the immediate aftermath of an acceleration in productivity cannot be judged therefore by comparing the actual unemployment rate to the estimate of the long-run NAIRU.,2000-10-19
The relevant comparison is between the current unemployment rate and an estimate of the short-run NAIRU that takes into account the disinflationary effect of the productivity shock.,2000-10-19
My preference is to estimate a short-run NAIRU that directly takes into account the disinflationary effect of an acceleration in productivity because the effects of an acceleration in productivity on inflation may persist long enough that the adjusted NAIRU might be useful in policy decisions.,2000-10-19
"On the other hand, I would leave out of such an estimation the effect of swings in oil prices, for example, because their effect on inflation dissipates more quickly.",2000-10-19
"The demand and direct disinflationary effects are both temporary, but the period over which each has its influence depends on different considerations.",2000-10-19
"The persistence of the demand effect depends on how long it takes for business capital stocks to adjust to higher expected profitability, for consumer durables to adjust to higher wealth and higher projected future income, and for market interest rates to close the gap relative to the higher equilibrium real interest rate.",2000-10-19
"The direct disinflationary effect of an acceleration in productivity is, in my view, temporary because it likely arises from the lag in the adjustment of nominal wages to the productivity acceleration.",2000-10-19
It dissipates gradually once productivity growth stabilizes and nominal wages catch up to the productivity acceleration.,2000-10-19
How rapidly this effect dissipates depends on how quickly productivity growth stabilizes and how rapidly nominal wage gains adjust to the higher productivity growth.,2000-10-19
A similar sluggish adjustment of nominal wages to productivity developments following the productivity slowdown in the early 1970s may have contributed to the sharp increase in inflation thereafter.3 Let me try to make a rough estimate of the direct disinflationary effect of the acceleration in productivity and the associated decline in the short-run NAIRU.,2000-10-19
The first step is to estimate the acceleration in trend productivity.,2000-10-19
If productivity has increased from 1-1/2 percent during the period from the early 1970s to the mid-1990s to the upper end of the estimate today--say 3-1/2 percent--then the total acceleration in productivity would be 2 percentage points.,2000-10-19
"If nominal wages do not immediately respond, the growth in labor costs will fall by precisely the same amount as the increase in the growth of labor productivity.",2000-10-19
"In this case, the direct disinflationary effect simply equals the acceleration in productivity.",2000-10-19
"However, the magnitude of the direct effect will diminish over time as wage growth catches up to the faster productivity growth, unless of course productivity continues to accelerate, as has been the case over the last several years.",2000-10-19
"Because wages have likely already partially adjusted to the cumulative increase in productivity growth during the last several years, the portion of the acceleration still putting downward pressure on inflation may be somewhat less than 2 percentage points.",2000-10-19
A simple way of judging the magnitude of the direct disinflationary effect is to calculate the difference between the current estimate of trend productivity and a moving average of this trend.,2000-10-19
The length of the moving average should be an estimate of the time it takes for nominal wages to fully respond to higher productivity growth.,2000-10-19
"In figure 2, I plot a measure of the direct disinflationary effect using a forty-quarter moving average of trend productivity.",2000-10-19
A ten-year moving average probably provides an upper end of the estimate of the direct disinflationary effect.,2000-10-19
"As you can see, this upper-end estimate is that the cumulative productivity acceleration is lowering inflation today by 1-1/2 percentage points, for any given unemployment rate.",2000-10-19
"Note that when this effect is positive, as it has been since the mid-1990s, it is a disinflationary effect and when it is negative--as it was following the decline in trend productivity growth after the early 1970s--it is an inflationary effect.",2000-10-19
The power and persistence of the direct disinflationary effect depends on both the pattern of the productivity acceleration and the speed of the adjustment process--specifically how fast wages respond directly to the productivity acceleration.,2000-10-19
"If the adjustment is very drawn out as shown in figure 2, then the direct disinflationary effect would have been quite large and this effect would continue to be important for some time, even once productivity growth stabilizes.",2000-10-19
"But if the adjustment were more rapid, the disinflationary effects of the acceleration in productivity would have been less powerful and would dissipate more rapidly once productivity growth stabilizes.",2000-10-19
These alternative moving averages translate into a range of 1/2 to 1-1/2 percentage points for the direct disinflationary effect of the acceleration in productivity growth.,2000-10-19
"In figure 3, I have assumed that the long-run NAIRU is 5-1/2 percent and that the long-run NAIRU has varied over the period from 1960 until today only in response to the effect of demographic changes on the average unemployment rate.4 As I explain in somewhat more detail in the appendix, I estimate the short-run NAIRU by subtracting the direct disinflationary effect of changes in trend productivity from the estimate of the long-run NAIRU.",2000-10-19
This has the convenient property that the bottom end of the range is consistent with the prevailing unemployment rate and would support the view that we might be approaching a type of soft landing--a convergence of growth to trend at a point when the unemployment rate is already at the short-run NAIRU.,2000-10-19
"In this case, there would not be any immediate upward pressure on core inflation.",2000-10-19
"The range also has the property that its mid-point value of the short-run is above the prevailing unemployment rate, implying some upward pressure on core inflation over the near term.",2000-10-19
The Favorable Policy Choice as the Economy Adjusts to an Acceleration in Productivity Policymakers face a choice when confronted with an acceleration in productivity--a choice among very favorable outcomes.,2000-10-19
"They can take the benefits of an acceleration in productivity in temporarily higher output (that is, a temporarily lower unemployment rate) or in lower inflation or in some combination of temporarily lower unemployment and lower inflation.",2000-10-19
"It depends on policymakers' preferences, as well as on where inflation is relative to policymakers' long-run inflation goal at the outset of the acceleration in productivity.",2000-10-19
The outcome also likely will depend on how quickly policymakers realize that productivity has accelerated and learn how the economy responds to this development.,2000-10-19
The response of monetary policy to the acceleration in productivity determines this choice.,2000-10-19
How have the benefits of the acceleration in productivity been taken in this episode?,2000-10-19
"To assess the outcome, it is most useful to look at the pattern of core measures of consumer price inflation--specifically measures of inflation based on the core PCE and the core CPI--during this period.",2000-10-19
I interpret the evidence as suggesting that we have taken a large part of the benefits of the acceleration in productivity in temporarily higher output and a smaller portion in the form of lower inflation.,2000-10-19
"But let me emphasize again that the outcome of this choice is not simply a reflection of policymakers preferences, but also of how quickly the policymakers came to understand the size of the productivity acceleration and how it was affecting the choices they face.",2000-10-19
The Monetary Policy Response: The Two-step There is considerable uncertainty today about the NAIRU.,2000-10-19
"While there is, to be sure, uncertainty about the long-run NAIRU, I expect much of the uncertainty today has followed from the effect of an acceleration of productivity on the short-run NAIRU.",2000-10-19
"At the risk of some oversimplification, recent monetary policy could be viewed as part of a two-step strategy that takes into account the uncertainty about the NAIRU.",2000-10-19
The first step is to slow the growth in real output to trend to stabilize the unemployment rate at the lower end of the range of estimates of the short-run NAIRU.,2000-10-19
"Thereafter comes step two, which is to apply a more reactive and less pre-emptive monetary policy.",2000-10-19
"That is, policy is then focused on testing whether or not the prevailing unemployment rate is sustainable with steady inflation.",2000-10-19
"If not, then monetary policy would respond to higher inflation by raising real interest rates.",2000-10-19
"That is, even if the unemployment rate today is consistent with the short-run NAIRU, the short-run NAIRU may have to rise over time as it converges toward the long-run NAIRU, at least once productivity growth stabilizes (or increases in productivity growth slow by a sufficient amount).",2000-10-19
A Transition to Below-Trend Growth and Rising Inflation?,2000-10-19
"From the end of 1995 until mid-2000, growth had been above trend and, as a result, the unemployment rate had been declining.",2000-10-19
"For much of the period, core inflation was declining.",2000-10-19
"I believe the economy will ultimately be confronted by a transition and that we may already be in this transition, specifically to slower growth and perhaps also higher core inflation.",2000-10-19
"The consensus private-sector forecast is for the growth in real GDP to slip below trend in the third quarter, then post a modest rebound in the fourth quarter, and continue in 2001 at a pace that will keep the unemployment rate nearly steady.",2000-10-19
"The consensus forecast also appears to be consistent with relatively stable core inflation, implying that the prevailing unemployment rate may be sustainable and that monetary policy may have succeeded in achieving a soft landing.",2000-10-19
"If so, monetary policy would have achieved a soft landing for the second time in the same expansion--a truly extraordinary feat.",2000-10-19
"Even if growth in real GDP remains at or modestly below trend for a period, there are, in my view, two potential sources of upward pressure on inflation over the next few years.",2000-10-19
The first is the possibility that the unemployment rate today is below the short-run NAIRU.,2000-10-19
"The central tendency for my estimate of the short-run NAIRU, for example, is above the prevailing unemployment rate, suggesting the potential for some upward creep on core inflation.",2000-10-19
The second source of higher inflation would be the gradual convergence of the short-run NAIRU to the long-run NAIRU should productivity growth stabilize and the direct disinflationary effect wane.,2000-10-19
"Unless the actual unemployment rate rises as this convergence progresses, the rise in the short-run NAIRU would result in further upward pressure in inflation.",2000-10-19
An important uncertainty in the forecast is the sustainability of the current rate of trend productivity growth.,2000-10-19
"For example, in the near term, the robust pace of capital spending could yield still higher productivity growth--through further increases in the ratio of capital services to labor, one of the principal sources of higher productivity growth.",2000-10-19
"Over a still longer period--and this may be several years to a decade or longer--it is quite possible that productivity growth, after reaching a peak, will then diminish.",2000-10-19
"If the acceleration in productivity reflects the bunching of technological innovations, the completion of their spread will signal that productivity has moved to its new, higher level and the growth in productivity may then diminish to a rate more consistent with its long-run historical average.",2000-10-19
Such a deceleration in productivity would bring with it the reverse of the favorable conditions that initially accompanied the acceleration in productivity--a choice between a higher unemployment rate and higher inflation and likely a combination of the two.,2000-10-19
"Even if productivity growth stabilizes at its current rate, we are, in my view, facing a transition.",2000-10-19
"This, of course, presumes that my story about the short-run effects of an acceleration in productivity is on the mark.",2000-10-19
"Initially, we faced a choice between temporarily lower unemployment and lower inflation, and experienced a combination of above-trend growth, a declining unemployment rate, and falling core inflation.",2000-10-19
The choices may now become less favorable--specifically some combination of slower growth and perhaps higher inflation.,2000-10-19
"Of course, because of the acceleration in productivity, such a slowdown may still leave the growth rate of real GDP well above the average that prevailed over the two or more decades preceding the acceleration.",2000-10-19
"If growth turns out to be close to trend for a while, the unemployment rate will stabilize at its prevailing value and core inflation will rise to the extent that the unemployment rate is below the short-run NAIRU.",2000-10-19
Inflation will rise further over time to the degree that the NAIRU moves toward its long-run value.,2000-10-19
The most benign outcome in this case might be a period of below-trend growth that would gradually reestablish a sustainable unemployment rate accompanied by a more modest increase in inflation.,2000-10-19
Given the uncertainty about this analysis--especially about the values of the short-run and long-run NAIRU--it is difficult to design a pre-emptive policy aimed at foreclosing the risk of higher inflation.,2000-10-19
"Monetary policy will, however, need to watch for signs of an upward creep in inflation that would be part of the transition that I have been discussing.",2000-10-19
"It is important to recognize, however, that there are options between a preemptive response based on the relationship between the unemployment rate and the NAIRU and a totally reactive approach of responding only to higher inflation itself.",2000-10-19
"For example, increases in unit labor costs or decreases in profit margins can be precursors of inflation.",2000-10-19
"The Interaction of Oil Price Swings and the Productivity Acceleration During the past several years, inflation performance has also been importantly affected by a series of relative price shocks--particularly swings in oil prices and in non-oil import prices.",2000-10-19
These shocks have interacted with the disinflationary effect of the acceleration in productivity.,2000-10-19
"For example, in 1997 and 1998, the decline in both oil prices and non-oil import prices significantly reinforced the direct disinflationary effect of the acceleration in productivity, contributing to a decline in overall CPI inflation to just 1.6 percent in 1998.",2000-10-19
"During most of this period, the unemployment rate, though falling, may have remained above the short-run NAIRU--as depicted in figure 3--because the short-run NAIRU was declining as a result of the acceleration in productivity.",2000-10-19
"Beginning in 1999, the direct effect of the rebound in oil prices increased overall inflation, and over the past year, the secondary effects of the rise in oil prices may have boosted core inflation, perhaps reinforcing the effect of an unemployment rate now below the short-run NAIRU.",2000-10-19
"The full effect of the recent rise in oil prices may still be feeding through to the prices of a broader range of goods and services, contributing to a near-term risk of higher inflation--even more so, of course, if oil prices move higher.",2000-10-19
"Going forward, the interaction of these two effects is likely to remain important in shaping the inflation outcome.",2000-10-19
"There is, in my view, a reasonable prospect that each of these two effects will reverse their contributions to inflation over the next couple of years and that balance between them will be important in determining the pattern of core and overall inflation rates.",2000-10-19
I noted above that we might be nearing or possibly already be in a transition that might include a period of upward pressure on core inflation.,2000-10-19
"If the expectations in futures prices for oil prove correct, however, we may soon be treated to an extended period of decline in oil prices.",2000-10-19
"But, thereafter, the fundamentals--some moderation in the robust pace of global growth and increased investment in oil-producing capacity--point to a gradual but potentially extended decline in the price of oil.",2000-10-19
A projected drop in oil prices likely underpins the consensus forecast of a decline in overall inflation next year.,2000-10-19
"Going forward, the secondary effects of lower oil prices would help to mitigate the rise in core inflation associated with prevailing and emerging demand pressures.",2000-10-19
"Ultimately, we would still have to deal with the persistent demand pressures on core inflation if the prevailing unemployment rate is below the short-run NAIRU and if the short-run NAIRU begins to converge toward its long-run value.",2000-10-19
But such a reversal in oil prices would buy some time in addressing this risk.,2000-10-19
But the interaction between the continuing adjustment to the acceleration in productivity and further swings in oil prices will likely play an important role in shaping the macroeconomic outcomes and the challenges facing monetary policy over the next couple of years.,2000-10-19
Appendix: Productivity and the NAIRU The model developed in this appendix supports both the analysis in the paper and the estimates of the magnitude of the disinflationary effect of an acceleration in productivity and of the short-run NAIRU.,2000-10-19
This paper examined the effect of the productivity deceleration in the early 1970s on inflation afterward.,2000-10-19
The insights developed by Braun were integrated into the modeling of inflation dynamics in the Board's large-scale quarterly econometric model.,2000-10-19
"To focus on the implications of the productivity acceleration, I have not incorporated relative price shocks into the model, though it would be straightforward to do so.",2000-10-19
Equations 1 to 3 set out a simple model of inflation dynamics that assumes that productivity affects wages and prices symmetrically.,2000-10-19
"In this case, an acceleration in productivity has no effect on the relationship between inflation and the unemployment rate.",2000-10-19
w = a + q - b U + pe p = w - q p = a - b U + pe w = rate of increase in nominal labor compensation p = inflation pe = expected inflation q = trend productivity growth q*= moving average of trend productivity growth U = unemployment rate Equation 1 is a wage-price specification of the Phillips curve.,2000-10-19
The rate of increase in nominal labor compensation (w) depends on the rate of unemployment (U) and expected inflation (pe).,2000-10-19
The price level is set as a markup over standardized productivity (the level of productivity adjusted for cyclical effects).,2000-10-19
"Equation 2 is growth rate version of the markup equation, assuming a constant markup; the inflation rate (p) equals the rate of growth in labor compensation less the trend growth rate of productivity (q).",2000-10-19
"This two-equation model of wage-price dynamics can be solved for the inflation rate by substituting equation 1 into equation 2, yielding the price-price specification of the Phillips curve, equation 3.",2000-10-19
"Here, inflation depends on the unemployment rate and expected inflation.",2000-10-19
"Because the productivity term, q, enters symmetrically in equations 1 and 2, it does not appear in equation 3.",2000-10-19
"That is, the inflation rate in this model is unaffected by the growth rate of productivity or any change in the growth rate.",2000-10-19
"The resulting expression, given in equation 4, is the level of the unemployment rate consistent with any steady rate of inflation, once inflation expectations have converged to this steady rate.",2000-10-19
Equation 1' presents the key modification of this simple model that caused an acceleration in productivity to have an effect on inflation.,2000-10-19
"In equation 1', the rate of increase in labor compensation now depends on a moving average of the trend rate of growth in labor productivity (q*) rather than on trend productivity growth itself.",2000-10-19
"The key assumption here is that a change in trend productivity growth affects wage change more slowly than price change--that is, productivity acceleration has an asymmetric effect on wages and prices.",2000-10-19
"This is modeled by assuming that wage change depends on q*, while the inflation equation (based on the markup equation) depends on q.",2000-10-19
"(1') w = a + q* - b U + pe The implications of this modification in the model can best be seen by substitution of 1' into 2 and solving for the revised specification of the price-price Phillips curve, equation 3'.",2000-10-19
"The inflation rate now depends on the difference between the level of trend growth and its moving average, q - q*.",2000-10-19
"Whenever trend productivity growth increases, q is greater than q* for a while, and inflation is reduced.",2000-10-19
"Once productivity growth stabilizes, q* ultimately converges to q.",2000-10-19
(3') p = a - [q - q*] - b U + pe p = inflation pe = expected inflation q = trend productivity growth q* = moving average of trend productivity growth U = unemployment rate The value of the NAIRU is usually derived by assuming that p = pe (as we did in deriving equation 4) and by setting all shock terms to zero.,2000-10-19
"It is also useful to derive a short-run or effective NAIRU, allowing for the effect of an acceleration of productivity on the level of the unemployment rate consistent with steady inflation.",2000-10-19
"If there is an acceleration in productivity, q will exceed q* for a while, and the short-run NAIRU will fall below the long-run NAIRU.",2000-10-19
"That is, the disinflationary effect of an acceleration in productivity allows the economy to operate at higher utilization rates (a lower unemployment rate) before encountering upward pressure on the inflation rate.",2000-10-19
"(4') U** = U* - (1/b) [q - q*] U** = short-run or effective NAIRU However, once productivity growth stabilizes at a higher level, q* will eventually catch up to q, and the disinflationary effect will gradually diminish and then completely disappear.",2000-10-19
"During this transition, inflation pressure will build if the unemployment rate remains unchanged.",2000-10-19
"In the charts presented in the paper, I put some rough quantitative dimensions on the short-run effect on inflation of an acceleration in productivity.",2000-10-19
"First, we need an estimate of q, trend productivity growth.",2000-10-19
There is a broad consensus that trend productivity growth was about 3 percent in the 1960s through the early 1970s and then about 1-1/2 percent until the mid-1990s.,2000-10-19
"As of yet, there is not a consensus about either the magnitude or the time pattern of the acceleration in productivity.",2000-10-19
The upper end of the range of estimates for trend productivity today is between 3 percent and 3-1/2 percent.,2000-10-19
I used 3-1/2 percent as the estimate of q today in deriving the estimate of the disinflationary effect of productivity and the range for the short-run NAIRU.,2000-10-19
This decision obviously maximizes the potential importance of the acceleration of productivity in explaining the relationship between inflation and unemployment in this episode.,2000-10-19
"Although the ""curve"" plotted in figure 1 is a fairly simple representation of the historical trends in labor productivity growth, it is similar to estimates produced using more sophisticated statistical techniques.",2000-10-19
"For example, as shown in the graph of actual and trend labor productivity in figure A.1, a trend measure derived in a production accounting framework (the thick dark line) closely follows the curve shown in figure 3, reproduced here as the dashed line.",2000-10-19
"This production-based measure of trend labor productivity has three components--capital deepening (derived from Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data on actual capital services, normalized by the FRB/US estimate of trend labor hours); the BLS estimate of changes in labor quality; and trend growth in multifactor productivity (MFP).",2000-10-19
The latter component is computed using a Hodrick-Prescott filter to extract the trend in actual MFP growth.,2000-10-19
All we can do is to seek alternative periods and try to determine which yields the best predictive performance in explaining inflation.,2000-10-19
"As you might suspect, it is difficult to pin down the precise period; this likely reflects the relatively limited experience with accelerations (or decelerations) in productivity growth and thus the paucity of data from which to make this estimate.",2000-10-19
"A damping factor is the likelihood that firms respond to the acceleration in productivity by increasing their markup, absorbing some of the benefits in higher profits and passing on only a portion of the acceleration in lower inflation.",2000-10-19
"We can capture this by assuming that m is the proportion absorbed in higher profits, so only (1 - m) is passed on in lower inflation.",2000-10-19
"Magnifying the disinflationary effect are the dynamics working from the initial effect on inflation to expected inflation and back to inflation--in effect, the virtuous wage-price cycle that is initiated by the direct disinflationary effect.",2000-10-19
"""Productivity and the NIIRU (and other Phillips Curve Issues).""",2000-10-19
"Footnotes 1 Reflecting the absence of a consensus about the short-run effects of an acceleration in productivity, most macroeconomic models do not fully incorporate either of these effects.",2000-10-19
"For example, the acceleration in productivity has contributed to the swing from deficit to surplus in the federal budget and appears to have encouraged an appreciation of the dollar.",2000-10-19
These effects in turn influenced the overall response of demand and inflation to the acceleration in productivity.,2000-10-19
I will then discuss longer-term challenges for the economy and wrap up with a discussion of monetary policy.,2017-02-22
The Current State of the Economy The Congress has tasked the Federal Reserve with achieving stable prices and maximum employment--the dual mandate.,2017-02-22
"The FOMC has set a longer-term price stability objective of 2 percent annual inflation, as measured by the PCE (personal consumption expenditures) price index.1 This is a symmetric objective, meaning that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2 percent.",2017-02-22
"Until early last year, inflation was running substantially below our 2 percent objective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices during late 2014 and early 2015.",2017-02-22
"However, because prices of energy and food commodities are often volatile, a core measure that excludes these components provides a better indication of where overall inflation is headed.",2017-02-22
"While core inflation has also run consistently below 2 percent in recent years, it has been gradually rising, with the most recent 12-month reading at 1.7 percent, three-tenths higher than a year ago (the black line in figure 1).",2017-02-22
"Market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved well above their lows of mid-2016 but remain below pre-crisis levels, and survey measures have stayed relatively well anchored.",2017-02-22
"Overall, inflation seems to be on track to reach the 2 percent objective over the next couple of years.",2017-02-22
"Although inflation is currently below our objective, core inflation has generally been close to 2 percent over the past 20 years.",2017-02-22
This outcome reflects the success of monetary policy in anchoring inflation expectations.,2017-02-22
Many indicators show that we have also made significant progress toward maximum employment.,2017-02-22
"Since 2010, payroll employment has increased by almost 16 million jobs, and the unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent to 4.8 percent--in line with most estimates of the longer-run normal level (or natural rate) of unemployment and with the median estimate by FOMC participants in the December 2016 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).",2017-02-22
"Accordingly, the red line in the figure indicates that the unemployment rate gap has essentially been closed.2 A variety of other measures also suggest that we are close to maximum employment.",2017-02-22
Surveys of household sentiment about the availability of jobs and of business sentiment regarding the difficulty of filling jobs have now reached levels seen in prior periods of full employment.,2017-02-22
"Moreover, although the pace of wage increases is slower than during pre-crisis periods of full employment, wages have been increasing faster than both output per hour (productivity) and inflation, and labor's share of income has begun to move up after a long decline.",2017-02-22
"All in all, we appear to be close to our employment objective, and are nearing our inflation objective.",2017-02-22
"Take the concept of ""maximum employment,"" which requires an estimate of both the natural rate of unemployment for those who are in the labor force and the sustainable level of labor force participation.3 The natural rate of unemployment is not directly observed, and the record suggests that it could be materially lower or higher than current estimates.4 There is also uncertainty about the underlying trend level of labor force participation.",2017-02-22
"By contrast, other recent work does not find a strong case for a meaningful further slack.6 The issue has important implications, since changes in participation can have material effects on the unemployment rate: Holding the level of employment constant, a 25 basis point change in the participation rate would lead roughly to a corresponding 40 basis point change in the unemployment rate.",2017-02-22
Longer-Run Issues Productivity and growth Our economy is strong and operating near its capacity.,2017-02-22
But we face important challenges when it comes to the longer-term growth rate of the economy.,2017-02-22
"Long-term economic growth depends mainly on nonmonetary factors such as population growth and workforce participation, the skills and aptitudes of our workforce, the tools at their disposal, and the pace of technological advance.",2017-02-22
The main long-run contribution monetary policy can make is to provide a stable macroeconomic and financial environment.,2017-02-22
The level of potential growth does have important implications for monetary policy.,2017-02-22
One of the surprising features of this expansion has been that 2 percent growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) has been enough to create solid job gains and unexpectedly large declines in unemployment.,2017-02-22
"During much of the recovery, forecasters have been overly optimistic about growth but too pessimistic on job creation and the decline in the unemployment rate.",2017-02-22
"In 2007, the average expectation for long-run GDP growth from the Blue Chip survey of 50 forecasters was 2.9 percent (figure 3).",2017-02-22
"Other forecasters have also lowered their estimates over time, including those sampled by the Survey of Professional Forecasters and, yes, FOMC participants.7 Yet, as this figure shows, unemployment has declined faster than expected.",2017-02-22
"The implication is that trend productivity and, ultimately, potential growth are lower than expected.",2017-02-22
The decline in estimates of potential growth has been driven largely by unexpectedly weak productivity growth.,2017-02-22
"Labor productivity has increased only 1/2 percent per year, on average, since 2011--the worst performance over such a period since World War II (figure 4).",2017-02-22
"As this figure shows, productivity growth moves around significantly over time and has averaged about 2 percent since 1970.",2017-02-22
"One factor behind the decline since the financial crisis is the relatively slow increase in the capital stock per worker, as weak demand and uncertainty about the future have held back business investment.",2017-02-22
"But the more important factor has been the marked decline in total factor productivity (TFP), which represents the part of productivity that is not explained by capital increases or increases in the skills of the labor force.",2017-02-22
"The decline in TFP growth has been widespread across advanced economies, suggesting that global trends are at play.8 There is no consensus about the future direction of productivity growth.9 Some argue that the important paradigm-changing innovations are behind us, while others think that this slowdown is only a passing phase.",2017-02-22
One thing on which all agree is that the future prospects for productivity growth and potential GDP are highly uncertain.,2017-02-22
I hope there is also broad agreement on the need for policies that maximize potential growth and spread prosperity as widely as possible.,2017-02-22
Low interest rates Another unanticipated feature of this recovery has been the low level of both short- and longer-term interest rates.,2017-02-22
"Much of the decline is due to significantly lower long-term expectations of inflation, as well as reduced term premiums, likely reflecting both lower inflation risk and the fact that, with anchored inflation expectations, nominal bonds have become an attractive hedge against market risk.",2017-02-22
Regulatory changes have raised demand for safe assets.,2017-02-22
Lower potential growth implies lower returns and therefore lower rates.,2017-02-22
Changes in savings and investment demand owing to demographics and other factors have put downward pressure on yields as well.,2017-02-22
"Many analysts believe that the neutral rate is even lower than that today and will only return to its longer-run value over time.12 One important implication is that today's low rates are not as stimulative as they may seem--consider that, despite historically low rates, inflation has run consistently below target.",2017-02-22
Monetary Policy amid Uncertainty I'd like to turn now to monetary policy.,2017-02-22
"I expect the economy to continue broadly along its current path, which implies further labor market tightening and inflation edging closer to 2 percent.",2017-02-22
"On this path, unemployment would decline modestly below current estimates of the natural rate and remain there for some time.",2017-02-22
"Before concluding, I would like to turn briefly to a discussion of how policy decisions are made, including the role of simple monetary policy rules.",2017-02-22
"Since the 1990s, central banks have grown ever more communicative about their monetary policy decisions.",2017-02-22
"A central tenet that underlies this increase in transparency is that monetary policy is more effective when the public understands how the central bank will respond to changing conditions, and can calibrate expectations accordingly.13 That means that the Committee must have a clearly communicated, systematic way of responding to changes in economic conditions and the outlook.",2017-02-22
"The Committee then makes a collective decision, embodied in the postmeeting statement, setting monetary policy to achieve those goals.14 Over time, incoming information and shocks to the economy inevitably alter views of the appropriate path for monetary policy.",2017-02-22
"These forecasts tend to converge over time to the Committee's 2 percent inflation objective and to each individual's interpretation of maximum employment, because each individual explicitly writes down a path for policy that is intended to achieve those outcomes.",2017-02-22
"For example, economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland regularly update on the Bank's website an analysis of seven different rules and their prescriptions.17 A good way to see the range of possibilities is through a generalized form of a Taylor-type rule (figure 6).18 As you can see, this rule is based on key factors for monetary policy, such as the neutral real rate of interest, or r*, and deviations of inflation and output or unemployment from their longer-run values.",2017-02-22
The rule also calls for an estimate of the output or unemployment rate gap.,2017-02-22
"To reduce that uncertainty, we often use the unemployment gap rather than the output gap in these rules.19 We also need to pick values for the coefficients a and b, whether they are the values John Taylor posited in his seminal 1993 article or other values from the vast literature that has come since.20 There are still other choices to make.",2017-02-22
Traditional policy rules are backward looking in the sense that they use available data about inflation and output.,2017-02-22
"But monetary policy needs to be forward looking, as I discussed, and there are rules that rely on forecasts of inflation and output.",2017-02-22
"Finally, many have advanced the view that, when times are particularly uncertain, monetary policy should react cautiously to incoming information.21 That insight leads to rules that incorporate inertia, thereby slowing down the movement of rates over time.",2017-02-22
"Figure 7 shows the prescriptions of three simple policy rules since 2000.22 While the rules often diverged, all of them called for a substantial reduction in the federal funds rate around the time of the financial crisis, and all of them prescribed easing well below the effective lower bound (ELB).23 Faced with the impossibility of providing more accommodation at the ELB through deeply negative policy rates, the Committee turned instead to two unconventional monetary policy tools--large-scale securities purchases and forward guidance.",2017-02-22
"If we replace that intercept with the median of the longer-run r* from the December 2016 SEP, which is 1 percent (the blue dashed line), we see that the rule prescribes policy interest rates lower than the unadjusted rule.",2017-02-22
"However, many observers believe that the neutral real interest rate is currently well below its longer-run value.",2017-02-22
"The first-difference rule shown by the purple dashed-dotted line incorporates forecasts by prescribing changes to the federal funds rate based on projected inflation relative to its objective and the projected change in the output gap.26 The insight behind this rule is that it does not require estimates of the neutral real rate or the level of the output gap.27 The green dashed line shows the policy prescription from an inertial version of the ""balanced approach"" rule with an intercept of 1 percent, which includes a lagged value of the nominal interest rate.28 This rule does not go as far as the first-difference rule in eliminating the level of r* from the policy prescription, but it does prescribe that policy move only slowly toward its longer-run level, which places less weight in the short-run on the estimate of r*.",2017-02-22
This rule prescription is closer to FOMC participants' assessments of appropriate monetary policy.,2017-02-22
"One such consideration of great importance is that, with the secular decline in interest rates over the past 35 years, policy is now far more likely to hit the ELB than had been thought, which may present severe challenges.",2017-02-22
But monetary policy may sometimes face tradeoffs between macroeconomic objectives and financial stability.,2017-02-22
Recent business cycles show that instability can emerge when inflation is under control.,2017-02-22
"This year's conference, ""Fed Policy: A Shadow Review,"" takes up the Federal Reserve's 2019 review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices.",2019-11-14
"This topic is, of course, timely and one to which I and others have devoted much thought over the past year.1 Motivation for the Review Although I will have more to say about the review in a moment, let me state at the outset that we believe our existing framework, which has been in place since 2012, has served us well and has enabled us to achieve and sustain our statutorily assigned goals of maximum employment and price stability.",2019-11-14
"However, we also believe now is a good time to step back and assess whether, and in what possible ways, we can refine our strategy, tools, and communication practices to achieve and maintain our goals as consistently and robustly as possible.2 With the U.S. economy operating at or close to maximum employment and price stability, now is an especially opportune time to conduct this review.",2019-11-14
"The unemployment rate is near a 50-year low, and inflation is running close to our 2 percent objective.",2019-11-14
"Perhaps most significantly, neutral interest rates appear to have fallen in the United States.3 A fall in neutral rates increases the likelihood that a central bank's policy rate will hit its effective lower bound (ELB) in future economic downturns.",2019-11-14
"That development, in turn, could make it more difficult during downturns for monetary policy to support spending and employment and to keep inflation from falling too far below the central bank's objectiveâ€”2 percent in the case of the Federal Reserve.4 Another key development in recent decades is that price inflation appears less responsive to resource slack.",2019-11-14
"That is, the short-run price Phillips curveâ€”if not the wage Phillips curveâ€”appears to have flattened, implying a change in the dynamic relationship between inflation and employment.5 A flatter Phillips curve permits the Federal Reserve to support employment more aggressively during downturnsâ€”as was the case during and after the Great Recessionâ€”because a sustained inflation breakout is less likely when the Phillips curve is flatter.6 However, a flatter Phillips curve also increases the cost, in terms of lost economic output, of reversing unwelcome increases in longer-run inflation expectations.",2019-11-14
"Thus, a flatter Phillips curve makes it all the more important that inflation expectations remain anchored at levels consistent with our 2 percent inflation objective.7 Based on the evidence I have reviewed, I judge that U.S. inflation expectations today do reside at the low end of a range I consider consistent with our priceâ€‘stability mandate.",2019-11-14
"A Robust U.S. Labor Market For some time now, price stability in the United States has coincided with a historically low unemployment rate.",2019-11-14
"This low unemployment rate, 3.6 percent in October, has been interpreted by many as suggesting that the labor market is currently operating beyond full employment.",2019-11-14
"However, we cannot directly observe the level of the unemployment rate that is consistent with full employment and price stability, u*, but must infer it from data via models.",2019-11-14
I myself believe that the range of plausible estimates of u* extends to 4 percent and below and includes the current unemployment rate of 3.6 percent.,2019-11-14
"As the unemployment rate has declined in recent years, labor force participation for people in their prime working years has increased significantly, with the October participation rate at a cycle high of 82.8 percent.8 Increased prime-age participation has provided employers with additional labor resources and has been one factor, along with a pickup in labor productivity, restraining inflationary pressures.",2019-11-14
"Also, although the labor market is robust, there is no evidence that rising wages are putting excessive upward pressure on price inflation.",2019-11-14
Wages today are increasing broadly in line with productivity growth and underlying inflation.,2019-11-14
"As I have written before, labor's share tends to rise as expansions endure and the labor market tightens.9 In recent cyclesâ€”and thus far in this cycleâ€”this rise in labor's share has not put excessive upward pressure on price inflation.",2019-11-14
"Scope of the Review The Federal Reserve Act instructs the Fed to conduct monetary policy ""so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.",2019-11-14
"""10 Our review this year takes this statutory mandate as given and also takes as given that inflation at a rate of 2 percent is most consistent over the longer run with the congressional mandate.",2019-11-14
"Our existing monetary policy strategy is laid out in the Committee's Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.11 First adopted in January 2012, the statement indicates that the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from 2 percent and deviations of employment from assessments of its maximum level.",2019-11-14
"In doing so, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) recognizes that these assessments of maximum employment are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision.",2019-11-14
"As a practical matter, our current strategy shares many elements with the policy framework known as ""flexible inflation targeting.",2019-11-14
"""12 However, the Fed's mandate is much more explicit about the role of employment than that of most flexible inflation-targeting central banks, and our statement reflects this by stating that when the two sides of the mandate are in conflict, neither one takes precedence over the other.",2019-11-14
"Three Questions The first question is, ""Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to reverse past misses of the inflation objective?""",2019-11-14
"Under our current approach as well as the approaches of many central banks around the world, persistent inflation shortfalls of the target are treated as ""bygones.""",2019-11-14
"Central banks are generally believed to have effective tools for preventing persistent inflation overshoots, but the ELB on interest rates makes persistent undershoots more of a challenge.",2019-11-14
"Persistent inflation shortfalls carry the risk that longer-term inflation expectations become anchored below the stated inflation goal.13 In part because of that concern, some economists have advocated ""makeup"" strategies under which policymakers seek to undo past inflation deviations from target.",2019-11-14
"These strategies include targeting average inflation and price-level targeting, in which policymakers seek to stabilize the price level around a constant growth path.14 Other makeup strategies seek to reverse shortfalls in policy accommodation at the ELB by keeping the policy rate lower for longer than otherwise would be the case.15 In many models that incorporate the ELB, these makeup strategies lead to better average performance on both legs of the dual mandate.16 The success of makeup strategies relies on households and firms believing in advance that the makeup will, in fact, be delivered when the time comesâ€”for example, that a persistent inflation shortfall will be met by future inflation above 2 percent.",2019-11-14
"As is well known from the research literature, makeup strategies, in general, are not time consistent because when the time comes to push inflation above 2 percent, conditions at that time will not justify that action.",2019-11-14
"The next question the review is considering is, ""Are existing monetary policy tools adequate to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability, or should the toolkit be expanded?",2019-11-14
The FOMC's primary monetary policy tool is its target range for the federal funds rate.,2019-11-14
"These enhancements include the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy; postmeeting press conferences; various statements about the principles and strategy guiding the Committee's normalization of monetary policy following the financial crisis; and quarterly summaries of individual FOMC participants' economic projections, assessments about the appropriate path of the federal funds rate, and judgments of the uncertainty and balance of risks around their projections.18 As part of the review, we are assessing the Committee's current and past communications and additional forms of communication that could be helpful.",2019-11-14
"For example, there might be ways to improve communication about the coordination of policy tools or the interplay between monetary policy and financial stability.",2019-11-14
"Last summer, the FOMC began to assess what we have learned at the Fed Listens events and to receive briefings from System staff on topics relevant to the review.20 At our July meeting, FOMC participants agreed that our current framework for monetary policy has served the Committee and the U.S. economy well over the past decade.",2019-11-14
"At our September meeting, we discussed makeup strategies in the context of a lower neutral policy interest rate, a reduction in conventional policy space, and a higher likelihood that future economic downturns will involve a return to the ELB.",2019-11-14
We generally agreed that our current monetary policy framework is flexible enough to allow the Committee to choose the policy actions that best support our dual-mandate objectives in a wide variety of economic circumstances.,2019-11-14
"In particular, we have not yet begun to consider potential changes to communication practices, including the Committee's consensus Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.",2019-11-14
"The statement has helped articulate and clarify the Federal Reserve's approach to monetary policy, and we have agreed that any changes we might make to our strategy would likely call for some modification of this consensus statement.",2019-11-14
"Most important, we have absorbed the central lesson of Milton Friedman's 1968 address to the American Economic Association--that any tradeoff between inflation and unemployment is only temporary because of the dynamic nature of expectations.",2005-09-29
We have also taken on board the practical application of this lesson that monetary policy must be vigilant about anchoring inflation expectations.,2005-09-29
"Operationally, maintaining price stability requires abiding by the Taylor principle of raising nominal interest rates more than one for one in response to movements in inflation, especially those movements perceived as persistent.",2005-09-29
"It also requires that policy tighten or ease systematically to bring aggregate demand in line with the economy's productive potential, not only because output stabilization is a policy objective in its own right but also because such actions help to head off undesirable changes in inflation down the road.",2005-09-29
"These basic precepts, embraced by central bankers everywhere, have almost certainly contributed to the improved performance of inflation over the past decade or two, and this better price performance probably has helped to damp business cycles.",2005-09-29
"Of course, economists and policymakers still have a great deal to learn about the interactions of monetary policy, the real economy, and inflation.",2005-09-29
"Still, when it comes to inflation modeling and policymaking, as my grade school report cards used to say: There is room for improvement.",2005-09-29
"Specifically, I wonder whether current inflation research adequately addresses the questions that bedevil me as a policymaker.",2005-09-29
What properties am I looking for in a model of inflation and the economy overall?,2005-09-29
"It starts with wages and the prices of other inputs into production, and after taking into account productivity, it sees prices set as a markup over unit costs.",2005-09-29
"Wage determination plays a key role in this framework and is influenced by such factors as inflation expectations, productivity, and labor market slack; the markup, too, is important because it varies over time depending on changes in the competitive environment, expected future costs, and other factors.",2005-09-29
"At first glance, the empirical structural models currently favored in academic research and discussed at this conference--such as the New Keynesian Phillips curve--appear to conform to the informal policymaker model: Expectations formation is dealt with formally, and price inflation, at least in some empirical representations, is directly tied to measures of unit labor costs.",2005-09-29
"On closer inspection, however, one sees that the specifications of these models typically ignore important factors bearing on the inflation outlook.",2005-09-29
"One category of neglected factors is price shocks--changes in the levels of key inputs, such as energy or imports.",2005-09-29
Policymakers spend a great deal of time discussing the circumstances under which such shocks can lead to persistent changes in the rate of inflation.,2005-09-29
"Yet, despite their historical importance for aggregate inflation, energy prices, for example, are controlled for in only one of the structural models discussed at this conference.",2005-09-29
"And this importance is not necessarily a concern of the past: Prices for oil and natural gas have soared since 2003, directly boosting the energy component of the consumer price index as well as raising the production costs, and ultimately to at least some degree the prices, of non-energy goods and services.",2005-09-29
"As a policymaker, I can assure you that any model of inflation that did not take account of these effects, and how they might or might not affect ongoing rates of inflation, would have been of little practical use to the FOMC over the past few years.",2005-09-29
Reduced-form regressions suggest that the response of core inflation to energy prices has diminished over the past twenty years.,2005-09-29
"Does this smaller response reflect a change in the expectations formation process that has come about because the public perceives that inflation will remain low, perhaps because the monetary authority is now seen to be more vigilant in reacting to price pressures?",2005-09-29
"Or does it reflect a reduction, from the late 1970s until a couple of years ago, in the persistence of energy price movements that has prompted firms to be less worried about passing temporary cost increases onto customers?",2005-09-29
"Determining which of these explanations is most important is a critical issue for monetary policy right now, when futures markets indicate that people expect the current elevated price of energy to persist.",2005-09-29
"True, financial market participants do seem to respond to incoming economic data in a generally forward-looking and logical manner, but we also observe asset price levels, volatility, and implied risk premiums that are sometimes difficult to understand.",2005-09-29
"Moreover, it is not obvious that investors' expectations always line up with those of households and firms, the ones that should matter for wage and price setting.",2005-09-29
Among other questions that could be addressed would be how policy actions (as opposed to inflation outcomes) influence expectations and how sensitive Federal Reserve credibility is to short-run departures from low inflation.,2005-09-29
Such knowledge would be extremely useful in current circumstances in gauging the scope for monetary policy to offset the short-run output effects of higher energy prices without triggering adverse longer-run inflation consequences.,2005-09-29
"My impression, reinforced by the papers at this conference, is that many of the newer empirical structural models of price inflation posit a central role for real marginal cost but seem to have little to say about its determination or that of its main component, labor compensation.",2005-09-29
"Many economists, both inside and outside the Federal Reserve, think that the acceleration in labor productivity in the mid-1990s subsequently helped to restrain the rate of price inflation.",2005-09-29
"This conclusion requires that the adjustment of nominal wages to the higher trend in productivity was slow, an outcome that put downward pressure on unit labor costs and, hence, on prices.",2005-09-29
"Structural models do not as yet fully encompass the information used by reduced-form specifications, and the historical relationships summarized in these latter models have often proven to be more useful guides to future inflation developments.",2005-09-29
Such models often include energy- and import-price terms along with measures of slack and expectations.,2005-09-29
They inform the staff's judgmental inflation forecast as well as my own thinking about the outlook.,2005-09-29
"Other measures of labor compensation, such as the employment cost index, have their own particular deficiencies and can yield conflicting signals of trends in labor costs.",2005-09-29
"Many inflation models in use, both structural and reduced-form, include some measure of resource utilization as a determinant of price inflation, such as the gap between the unemployment rate and the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU).",2005-09-29
"Paradoxically, the ability to confirm our estimates of output relative to potential in a timely way may have been diminished by the success of the Federal Reserve and other central banks in achieving low and stable inflation.",2005-09-29
"Although controversial, some evidence from reduced-form price equations suggests that inflation has become less sensitive to economic slack in recent years, possibly as a consequence of more firmly anchored inflation expectations.",2005-09-29
"Consistent with this evidence, the Board staff's rule-of-thumb estimate of the sacrifice ratio rose from around 2 or 3 in the mid-1980s to around 4 currently.2 Imbalances between demand and potential supply would thus now be slow to show through convincingly to inflation, but when they do, they may be costly to correct.",2005-09-29
"In particular, its wage and price equations are variants of the New Keynesian Phillips curve, with core specifications that are derived from cost minimization and equations that are estimated assuming rational expectations.",2005-09-29
"However, in incorporating the effects of such factors as energy costs, import prices, and productivity into the model's wage-price block, the staff found it necessary to sacrifice some theoretical niceties in order to get close to the predictive accuracy provided by reduced-form models.",2005-09-29
"Although the policy analyses generated using the model have been quite useful from my perspective, and the model has compiled a reasonable forecasting record overall, the accuracy of its price inflation forecasts has suffered from their sensitivity to current readings on labor's share.",2005-09-29
You might ask: Does successful monetary policymaking really require all this additional knowledge?,2005-09-29
"If policymakers continue to recognize the critical role of long-term price stability, keep a close eye on inflation expectations, and adhere to the Taylor principle, would not things be OK, as they have been for much of the past twenty years?",2005-09-29
And we would do well to be cautious about attributing the good macroeconomic performance entirely to good monetary policy.,2005-09-29
"In my remarks today, I will review the considerable progress the economy has made toward the attainment of the two objectives that the Congress has assigned to the Federal Reserve--maximum employment and price stability.",2017-01-19
"The upshot is that labor utilization is close to its estimated longer-run normal level, and we are closing in on our 2 percent inflation objective.",2017-01-19
I will then discuss the prospects for adjusting monetary policy in the manner needed to sustain a strong job market while maintaining low and stable inflation.,2017-01-19
"In 2016, job gains averaged about 180,000 per month, well above the pace of 75,000 to 125,000 per month that is probably consistent with keeping the unemployment rate stable over the longer run.1 The unemployment rate is now close to estimates of its longer-run normal level, and other measures of labor utilization have improved appreciably.",2017-01-19
"As shown in figure 1, a broader measure of labor underutilization--the U-6 measure, which includes not only the unemployed but also people working part time who would like full-time employment and those who would like a job but are not actively looking--has retraced nearly all of the steep run-up that occurred as a result of the recession.2 Other indicators also support the view that the labor market has largely recovered from the severe downturn that occurred in the wake of the financial crisis.",2017-01-19
"Of course, both the labor force participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio are still much lower than they were a decade ago.",2017-01-19
"But the cyclical element in these declines looks to have largely disappeared, and what is left seems to mostly reflect the aging of the population and other secular trends.3 Based on this array of labor market indicators, I judge labor utilization to be reasonably close to its normal longer-run level while also recognizing that estimates of the sustainable levels of the unemployment rate and the employment-to-population ratio are inherently imprecise.4 In the coming months, I expect some further strengthening in labor market conditions as the economy continues to expand at a moderate pace--a view that is shared by most of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).5 Overall economic growth has been driven by consumer spending, which has been bolstered by substantial gains in household income and wealth.",2017-01-19
"But recent readings on business sentiment and new orders for equipment are consistent with the view that capital spending will likely strengthen modestly this year; another positive factor is that oil drilling, which plummeted after oil prices fell sharply back in late 2014, has recently begun to pick up.",2017-01-19
"As we look to broader trends, gross domestic product (GDP) growth has been restrained in recent years by a variety of forces depressing both supply and demand, including slow labor force and productivity growth, weak growth abroad, and lingering headwinds from the financial crisis.",2017-01-19
"Although I am cautiously optimistic that some of these forces will abate over time, I anticipate that they will continue to restrain overall growth over the medium term, likely holding down the level of interest rates consistent with stable labor market conditions.",2017-01-19
"Turning to inflation, we are now much closer to the FOMC's 2 percent objective than we were just a year ago.",2017-01-19
"Prices, as measured by the index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE), rose nearly 1-1/2 percent in the 12 months ending in November, as compared with only 1/2 percent during 2015.",2017-01-19
"Moreover, core PCE inflation--a better indicator of the underlying inflation trend--picked up 1/4 percentage point, to a little over 1-1/2 percent.",2017-01-19
This rise in inflation was anticipated and largely represents a fading of the effects of earlier declines in energy prices and the prices of non-energy imports.,2017-01-19
"In addition, slack in labor and product markets is no longer placing downward pressure on inflation, in contrast to the situation only a few years ago when the unemployment rate was still quite elevated.",2017-01-19
"Barring future major swings in oil prices and the foreign exchange value of the dollar, inflation is likely to move up to 2 percent over the next couple of years, aided by a strong labor market.",2017-01-19
"In light of the progress that has been achieved toward our employment and inflation objectives and the Committee's assessment of the outlook, the FOMC raised the target range for the federal funds rate at its December meeting by 25 basis points, to between 50 and 75 basis points.",2017-01-19
"The Committee judges, however, that the stance of monetary policy remains modestly accommodative, and so policy should support some further strengthening in labor market conditions and thus the return of inflation to our 2 percent goal.",2017-01-19
"Maintaining Sustainable Growth in a Context of Price Stability With the unemployment rate near its longer-run normal level and likely to move a bit lower this year, a natural question is whether monetary policy has fallen behind the curve.",2017-01-19
"As shown in figure 3, increases in average hourly earnings, the employment cost index, and compensation per hour remain subdued, picking up only modestly of late.6 Again, these data do not seem consistent with an overheated labor market.",2017-01-19
"Most importantly, although core inflation is rising gradually from a low level, this increase mainly reflects the waning of the effects of earlier movements in the dollar, not upward pressure from resource utilization.",2017-01-19
"Of course, even if the labor market is not overheated currently, one might worry that overheating could rapidly emerge as labor market conditions strengthen further, causing inflation to surge.",2017-01-19
"First, the pace of labor market improvement has slowed appreciably in the past couple of years: For example, average payroll gains moderated from 250,000 per month in 2014 to 180,000 last year, and the unemployment rate declined 1-3/4 percentage points cumulatively over 2014 and 2015, compared with only 1/4 percentage point last year.7 Second, economic growth more broadly seems unlikely to pick up markedly in the near term given the ongoing restraint from weak foreign demand and other factors that I mentioned, particularly in an environment in which monetary policy is likely to become gradually less accommodative.",2017-01-19
"Finally, figure 4 illustrates the relationship over the past several decades between labor market pressures and core inflation.",2017-01-19
"Note that during periods when the unemployment rate fell below the Congressional Budget Office's estimate of its normal long-run level, shown by the yellow shaded regions, core inflation, the solid red line, rose little, if at all.",2017-01-19
"This stability is especially marked since inflation expectations became anchored during the mid-to-late 1990s.8 That said, I think that allowing the economy to run markedly and persistently ""hot"" would be risky and unwise.",2017-01-19
"Waiting too long to remove accommodation could cause inflation expectations to begin ratcheting up, driving actual inflation higher and making it harder to control.",2017-01-19
"The combination of persistently low interest rates and strong labor market conditions could lead to undesirable increases in leverage and other financial imbalances, although such risks would likely take time to emerge.9 Finally, waiting too long to tighten policy could require the FOMC to eventually raise interest rates rapidly, which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into recession.",2017-01-19
"For these reasons, I consider it prudent to adjust the stance of monetary policy gradually over time--a strategy that should improve the prospects that the economy will achieve sustainable growth with the labor market operating at full employment and inflation running at about 2 percent.",2017-01-19
"Evaluating the Appropriate Stance of Monetary Policy Achieving these goals could prove challenging, however, even if the economy manages to avoid being hit with adverse shocks over the next few years.",2017-01-19
"To sustain a strong job market with inflation at our 2 percent objective, policy must gradually shift toward a neutral stance, where ""neutral"" is defined as a level of the federal funds rate that is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating near its potential.",2017-01-19
"To help answer such questions, the FOMC considers a voluminous amount of information concerning many factors, including financial markets and credit availability, labor market conditions and overall economic activity, wages and prices, and foreign economic developments.",2017-01-19
"The FOMC also evaluates forecasts from a range of economic models, assessments of key risks to the outlook, and detailed analyses of how different monetary policy strategies would affect projected outcomes and risks.",2017-01-19
Among the strategies routinely considered by the Committee are the recommendations of a variety of simple monetary policy rules.,2017-01-19
"In addition, FOMC participants prepare individual projections on a quarterly basis of the most likely paths of key macroeconomic variables under their own assessments of ""appropriate monetary policy,"" together with their estimates of the normal longer-run values of the federal funds rate, the unemployment rate, and GDP growth.10Armed with this wealth of information, the Committee as a whole then decides on the most appropriate policy action to adopt at each of its meetings.",2017-01-19
"As I noted, the Committee routinely reviews policy recommendations from a variety of benchmark rules, and I believe that their prescriptions can be helpful in providing broad guidance about how the federal funds rate should be adjusted over time in response to movements in real activity and inflation.",2017-01-19
"Consider first the well-known Taylor rule, which embodies key principles of good monetary policy.",2017-01-19
"The rule calls for systematic adjustments in the federal funds rate relative to its expected longer-run neutral level in response to movements in inflation and the output gap, defined as the percentage difference between actual output and the economy's productive potential.12 To implement the rule, one must decide on the appropriate definition and measurement of its inputs.",2017-01-19
Should inflation be defined using the latest noisy quarterly reading on headline PCE inflation or a measure intended to smooth through transitory price movements?,2017-01-19
"The Taylor rule is often implemented by assuming that the real, or inflation-adjusted, value of the longer-run neutral interest rate--which I will call R* for convenience--is equal to 2 percent, roughly the average historical value of the real federal funds rate prior to the financial crisis.",2017-01-19
"For inflation, we can use the 12-month change in core PCE prices, a measure of the current underlying rate of inflation.",2017-01-19
"And the output gap can be reasonably approximated as twice the difference between the estimated longer-run normal rate of unemployment and the actual unemployment rate.13 The dashed red line in figure 5 shows the resulting recommendations for policy over the medium term, based on the medians of the unemployment and inflation projections submitted by FOMC participants in December but assuming--in contrast to the median of participants' December assessments--that R* equals 2 percent.",2017-01-19
"As illustrated by the left-hand panel of figure 6, since 2000, both FOMC participants and respondents to the Blue Chip survey have markedly reduced their projections of the level of real short-term interest rates expected to prevail in the longer run.",2017-01-19
"Presumably, these revisions were made in response to accumulating evidence that lower real interest rates than those seen on average in the past would be needed permanently to keep the economy operating on an even keel.",2017-01-19
"In addition, the right-hand panel shows considerable changes over time in estimates of the normal longer-run rate of unemployment, with corresponding implications for estimates of the economy's productive potential and the output gap.",2017-01-19
"Such revisions would imply shifts in the level of the Taylor rule's prescriptions by as much as 1-1/4 percentage points, holding other factors constant.14 Clearly, sensible implementation of policy rules requires adjustments to take such changes into account, as a failure to do so would result in poor monetary policy decisions and poor economic outcomes.15 Figure 7 illustrates the policy implications of alternative revised assessments of the longer-run neutral real rate of interest.",2017-01-19
"Because overall growth has been quite moderate over the past few years despite an accommodative stance of monetary policy, some recent estimates of the current value of the neutral real federal funds rate stand close to zero.16 If the neutral rate were to remain quite low over the medium term, as would be expected if the global economy does not materially strengthen and productivity growth remains anemic, then the appropriate setting for R* in the Taylor rule would arguably be zero, yielding a yet lower path for the federal funds rate, as shown by the long-dashed red line.",2017-01-19
"For example, simple rules ignore such important factors as fiscal policy, trends affecting global growth, structural developments influencing the supply of credit, and overall financial conditions.",2017-01-19
"The downward pressure on longer-term interest rates that the Fed's asset holdings exert is expected to diminish over time--a development that amounts to a ""passive"" removal of monetary policy accommodation.",2017-01-19
"But if the economy instead began to overheat, threatening to push inflation to an undesirably high level, the FOMC would have ample scope to respond through tighter monetary policy.",2017-01-19
"Because participants on average anticipate a modest undershooting of the unemployment rate below its estimated longer-run level, the balanced-approach rule calls for a slightly faster pace of tightening over the next several years than the Taylor rule.",2017-01-19
"As its name implies, this rule does not prescribe a particular level of the federal funds rate at a given time but rather how the existing rate should change from quarter to quarter based on two gaps--the difference between inflation and its desired level as well as the difference between the unemployment rate and its longer-run normal level.20 In contrast to the other two rules, the change rule does not take a stand on the value of the longer-run neutral level of the real federal funds rate, thus avoiding a potential source of error.",2017-01-19
"Instead, it moves interest rates up and down until both gaps close, an approach that in theory enables it to perform well when the true value of R* is unknown.",2017-01-19
"Because both gaps are relatively modest at the moment and are projected to remain so, the change rule calls for fairly gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy over the next few years given the current outlook.",2017-01-19
"Nevertheless, the three benchmarks I have described--the Taylor rule, the balanced-approach rule, and the change rule, appropriately calibrated--have historically provided useful guidance about appropriate adjustments in the general direction of monetary policy over time.",2017-01-19
"This guidance is illustrated by figure 9, which compares the path of the federal funds rate since 2000 with the prescriptions of the three rules, based on the actual rates of inflation and unemployment observed at each point in time, along with contemporaneous Blue Chip projections of the longer-run unemployment rate and R*.",2017-01-19
"In addition, all three rules signaled that monetary policy needed to provide more stimulus during the recession and the subsequent recovery than could be provided by keeping short-term interest rates near zero.",2017-01-19
"For this reason, the Committee turned to asset purchases to help make up for the shortfall by putting additional downward pressure on longer-term interest rates.",2017-01-19
"Consistent with this advice, the FOMC suspended its asset purchase program in mid-2014 and began raising the federal funds rate in late 2015.22 To sum up, simple policy rules can serve as useful benchmarks to help assess how monetary policy should be adjusted over time.",2017-01-19
Conclusion My remarks have focused on the policy trajectory that the Committee now considers likely to be appropriate to sustain the economic expansion while keeping inflation close to our 2 percent goal.,2017-01-19
"For example, productivity growth is a key determinant of the neutral rate, and while most forecasters expect productivity growth to pick up from its recent unusually slow pace, the timing of such a pickup is highly uncertain.",2017-01-19

"October 19, 2007 Monetary Policy under Uncertainty Chairman Ben S. Bernanke At the 32nd Annual Economic Policy Conference, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (via videoconference) Share Bill Poole's career in the Federal Reserve System spans two decades separated by a quarter of a century.",2007-10-19
"As it happens, each of Bill's two decades in the System was a time of considerable research and analysis on the issue of how economic uncertainty affects the making of monetary policy, a topic on which Bill has written and spoken many times.",2007-10-19
"From the traditional Keynesian perspective, which was the dominant viewpoint of the time, monetary policy faced a long-term tradeoff between inflation and unemployment that it could exploit to keep unemployment low over an indefinitely long period at an acceptable cost in terms of inflation.",2007-10-19
"Friedman believed that the inherent complexity of the economy, the long and variable lags with which monetary policy operates, and the political and bureaucratic influences on central bank decisionmaking precluded policy from fine tuning the level of economic activity.",2007-10-19
"Friedman advocated the use of simple prescriptions for monetary policy--such as the k percent money growth rule--which he felt would work reasonably well on average while avoiding the pitfalls of attempting to fine-tune the economy in the face of pervasive uncertainty (Friedman, 1968).",2007-10-19
"During this decade, those researchers as well as sympathetic policymakers focused especially on three areas of economic uncertainty: the current state of the economy, the structure of the economy (including the transmission mechanism of monetary policy), and the way in which private agents form expectations about future economic developments and policy actions.",2007-10-19
"For example, a given change in output could be the result of a change in aggregate demand, in aggregate supply, or in some combination of the two.",2007-10-19
"As most of my listeners know, Bill Poole tackled these issues in a landmark 1970 paper, which examined how uncertainty about the state of the economy affects the choice of the operating instrument for monetary policy (Poole, 1970).",2007-10-19
"In the simplest version of his model, Bill assumed that the central bank could choose to specify its monetary policy actions in terms of a particular level of a monetary aggregate or a particular value of a short-term nominal interest rate.",2007-10-19
"If the central bank has only partial information about disturbances to money demand and to aggregate demand, Bill showed that the optimal choice of policy instrument depends on the relative variances of the two types of shocks.",2007-10-19
"In particular, using the interest rate as the policy instrument is the better choice when aggregate demand is relatively stable but money demand is unstable, with money growth being the preferable policy instrument in the opposite case.",2007-10-19
"For example, Bill wrote a Federal Reserve staff paper titled ""Rules-of-Thumb for Guiding Monetary Policy"" (Poole, 1971).",2007-10-19
"Because his econometric analysis of the available data indicated that money demand was more stable than aggregate demand, Bill formulated a simple rule that adjusted the money growth rate in response to the observed unemployment rate.",2007-10-19
"Friedman (1968) and Ned Phelps (1969) were the first to highlight the central importance of expectations formation, arguing that the private sector's expectations adjust in response to monetary policy and therefore preclude any long-run tradeoff between unemployment and inflation.",2007-10-19
"However, Friedman and Phelps retained the view that monetary policy could exert substantial effects on the real economy over the short to medium run.",2007-10-19
"In contrast, Robert Lucas and others reached more dramatic conclusions, arguing that only unpredictable movements in monetary policy can affect the real economy and concluding that policy has no capacity to smooth the business cycle (Lucas, 1972; Sargent and Wallace, 1975).",2007-10-19
"Although these studies highlighted the centrality of inflation expectations for the analysis of monetary policy, the profession did not succeed in reaching any consensus about how those expectations evolve, especially in an environment of ongoing structural change.",2007-10-19
Developments during the Second Period: 1998-2007 Research during the past ten years has been very fruitful in expanding the profession's understanding of the implications of uncertainty for the design and conduct of monetary policy.,2007-10-19
"Money demand relationships were relatively stable through the 1950s and 1960s, but, in the wake of dramatic innovations in banking and financial markets, short-term money-demand relationships became less predictable, at least in the United States.",2007-10-19
"As a result, consistent with the policy implication of Bill's 1970 model, the Federal Reserve (like most other central banks) today uses the overnight interbank rate as the principal operating target of monetary policy.",2007-10-19
"Bill's research also raised the possibility of specifying the operating target in other ways, for example, as an index of monetary or financial conditions; and it provided a framework for evaluating the usefulness of intermediate targets--such as core inflation or the growth of broad money--that are only indirectly controlled by policy.",2007-10-19
"Indeed, our appreciation of that challenge has been enhanced by recent research using real time data sets.1 For example, Athanasios Orphanides has shown that making such real-time assessments of the sustainable levels of economic activity and employment is considerably more difficult than estimating those levels retrospectively.",2007-10-19
His 2002 study of U.S. monetary policy in the 1970s shows how mismeasurement of the sustainable level of economic activity can lead to serious policy mistakes.,2007-10-19
"For example, when the degree of structural inertia in the inflation process is uncertain, the optimal Bayesian policy tends to involve a more pronounced response to shocks than would be the case in the absence of uncertainty (Söderstrom, 2002).",2007-10-19
"Given the centrality of inflation expectations for the design of monetary policy, a key development over the past decade has been the burgeoning literature on the formation of these expectations in the absence of full knowledge of the underlying structure of the economy.2 For example, considerations of how the public learns about the economy and the objectives of the central bank can affect the form of the optimal monetary policy (Gaspar, Smets, and Vestin, 2006; Orphanides and Williams, 2007).",2007-10-19
"Furthermore, when the public is unsure about the central bank's objectives, even greater benefits may accompany achieving a stable inflation rate, as doing so may help anchor the public's inflation expectations.",2007-10-19
"These studies also show why central bank communications is a key component of monetary policy; in a world of uncertainty, informing the public about the central bank's objectives, plans, and outlook can affect behavior and macroeconomic outcomes (Bernanke, 2004; and Orphanides and Williams, 2005).",2007-10-19
"Conclusion Uncertainty--about the state of the economy, the economy's structure, and the inferences that the public will draw from policy actions or economic developments--is a pervasive feature of monetary policy making.",2007-10-19
"Output growth has returned to healthy levels, the labor market is firming, and inflation appears to be well controlled.",2005-04-14
"However, one aspect of U.S. economic performance still evokes concern among economists and policymakers: the nation's large and growing current account deficit.",2005-04-14
"In 2004, the U.S. external deficit stood at $666 billion, or about 5-3/4 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP).",2005-04-14
"Corresponding to that deficit, U.S. citizens, businesses, and governments on net had to raise $666 billion on international capital markets.1 The current account deficit has been on a steep upward trajectory in recent years, rising from a relatively modest $120 billion (1.5 percent of GDP) in 1996 to $414 billion (4.2 percent of GDP) in 2000 on its way to its current level.",2005-04-14
What implications do the U.S. current account deficit and our consequent reliance on foreign credit have for economic performance in the United States and in our trading partners?,2005-04-14
"Although domestic developments have certainly played a role, I will argue that a satisfying explanation of the recent upward climb of the U.S. current account deficit requires a global perspective that more fully takes into account events outside the United States.",2005-04-14
"To be more specific, I will argue that over the past decade a combination of diverse forces has created a significant increase in the global supply of saving--a global saving glut--which helps to explain both the increase in the U.S. current account deficit and the relatively low level of long-term real interest rates in the world today.",2005-04-14
"To be clear, in locating the principal causes of the U.S. current account deficit outside the country's borders, I am not making a value judgment about the behavior of either U.S. or foreign residents or their governments.",2005-04-14
"Rather, I believe that understanding the influence of global factors on the U.S. current account deficit is essential for understanding the effects of the deficit and for devising policies to address it.",2005-04-14
"Of course, as always, the views I express today are not necessarily shared by my colleagues at the Federal Reserve.2 The U.S. Current Account Deficit: Two Perspectives We will find it helpful to consider, as background for the analysis of the U.S. current account deficit, two alternative ways of thinking about the phenomenon--one that relates the deficit to the patterns of U.S. trade and a second that focuses on saving, investment, and international financial flows.",2005-04-14
"By definition, this excess of U.S. payments to foreigners over payments received in a given period equals the U.S. current account deficit, which, as I have already noted, was $666 billion in 2004--close to the $617 billion by which the value of U.S. imports exceeded that of exports.",2005-04-14
"When U.S. receipts from its sales of exports and other current payments are insufficient to cover the cost of U.S. imports and other payments to foreigners, U.S. households, firms, and governments on net must borrow the difference on international capital markets.3 Thus, essentially by definition, in each period U.S. net foreign borrowing equals the U.S. current account deficit, which in turn is closely linked to the imbalance in U.S. international trade.",2005-04-14
"The extensive attention paid to the trade imbalance in the media and elsewhere has tempted some observers to ascribe the growing current account deficit to factors such as changes in the quality or composition of U.S. and foreign-made products, changes in trade policy, or unfair foreign competition.",2005-04-14
"Rather, the U.S. trade balance is the tail of the dog; for the most part, it has been passively determined by foreign and domestic incomes, asset prices, interest rates, and exchange rates, which are themselves in turn the products of more fundamental driving forces.",2005-04-14
"In the United States, as in all countries, economic growth requires investment in new capital goods and the upgrading and replacement of older capital.",2005-04-14
"By definition, national saving is the sum of saving done by households (for example, through contributions to employer-sponsored 401(k) accounts) and saving done by businesses (in the form of retained earnings) less any budget deficit run by the government (which is a use rather than a source of saving).5 As I say, in a closed economy investment would equal national saving in each period; but, in fact, virtually all economies today are open economies, and well-developed international capital markets allow savers to lend to those who wish to make capital investments in any country, not just their own.",2005-04-14
"We saw earlier that the current account deficit equals the net amount that the United States borrows abroad in each period, and I have just shown that U.S. net foreign borrowing equals the excess of U.S. capital investment over U.S. national saving.",2005-04-14
It follows that the country's current account deficit equals the excess of its investment over its saving.,2005-04-14
"To summarize, I have described two equivalent ways of interpreting the current account deficit, one in terms of trade flows and related payments and one in terms of investment and national saving.",2005-04-14
"As I have already suggested, most economists who have offered explanations of the high and rising level of the U.S. current account deficit and the country's foreign borrowing have emphasized investment-saving behavior rather than trade-related factors (and I will do the same today).",2005-04-14
"Along these lines, one commonly hears that the U.S. current account deficit is the product of a precipitous decline in the U.S. national saving rate, which in recent years has fallen to a level that is far from adequate to fund domestic investment.",2005-04-14
"Those who emphasize the role of low U.S. saving often go on to conclude that, for the most part, the U.S. current account deficit is ""made in the U.S.A."" and is independent (to a first approximation) of developments in other parts of the globe.",2005-04-14
"That inadequate U.S. national saving is the source of the current account deficit must be true at some level; indeed, the statement is almost a tautology.",2005-04-14
"One popular argument for the ""made in the U.S.A."" explanation of declining national saving and the rising current account deficit focuses on the burgeoning U.S. federal budget deficit, which in 2004 drained more than $400 billion from the national saving pool.",2005-04-14
I will discuss the link between the budget deficit and the current account deficit in more detail later.,2005-04-14
"Here I simply note that the so-called twin-deficits hypothesis, that government budget deficits cause current account deficits, does not account for the fact that the U.S. external deficit expanded by about $300 billion between 1996 and 2000, a period during which the federal budget was in surplus and projected to remain so.",2005-04-14
"Nor, for that matter, does the twin-deficits hypothesis shed any light on why a number of major countries, including Germany and Japan, continue to run large current account surpluses despite government budget deficits that are similar in size (as a share of GDP) to that of the United States.",2005-04-14
The Changing Pattern of International Capital Flows and the Global Saving Glut What then accounts for the rapid increase in the U.S. current account deficit?,2005-04-14
"Table 1 provides a basis for a discussion of recent changes in global saving and financial flows by showing current account balances for different countries and regions, in billions of U.S. dollars, for the years 1996 (just before the U.S. current account deficit began to balloon), 2000, and 2004.",2005-04-14
"Nevertheless, changes in the pattern of current account balances together with knowledge of changes in real interest rates should provide useful clues about shifts in the global supply of and demand for saving.",2005-04-14
"Return to table The table confirms the sharp increase in the U.S. current account deficit, about $546 billion between 1996 and 2004.",2005-04-14
The $546 billion increase in the U.S. current account deficit between 1996 and 2004 must therefore have been matched by a shift toward surplus of equal magnitude in other countries.,2005-04-14
"The collective current account of the industrial countries declined more than $441 billion between 1996 and 2004, implying that, of the $548 billion increase in the U.S. current account deficit, only about $106 billion was offset by increased surpluses in other industrial countries.",2005-04-14
"As table 1 shows, the bulk of the increase in the U.S. current account deficit was balanced by changes in the current account positions of developing countries, which moved from a collective deficit of $90 billion to a surplus of $326 billion--a net change of $416 billion-- between 1996 and 2004.",2005-04-14
"Loss of lender confidence, together with other factors such as overvalued fixed exchange rates and debt that was both short-term and denominated in foreign currencies, ultimately culminated in painful financial crises, including those in Mexico in 1994, in a number of East Asian countries in 1997-98, in Russia in 1998, in Brazil in 1999, and in Argentina in 2002.",2005-04-14
"The effects of these crises included rapid capital outflows, currency depreciation, sharp declines in domestic asset prices, weakened banking systems, and recession.",2005-04-14
"For example, in response to instability of capital flows and the exchange rate, some East Asian countries, such as Korea and Thailand, began to build up large quantities of foreign-exchange reserves and continued to do so even after the constraints imposed by the halt to capital inflows from global financial markets were relaxed.",2005-04-14
"Additionally, reserves were accumulated in the context of foreign exchange interventions intended to promote export-led growth by preventing exchange-rate appreciation (Dooley, Folkerts-Landau, and Garber, 2004).",2005-04-14
Countries typically pursue export-led growth because domestic demand is thought to be insufficient to employ fully domestic resources.,2005-04-14
"A related strategy has focused on reducing the burden of external debt by attempting to pay down those obligations, with the funds coming from a combination of reduced fiscal deficits and increased domestic debt issuance.",2005-04-14
Another factor that has contributed to the swing toward current-account surplus among the non-industrialized nations in the past few years is the sharp rise in oil prices.,2005-04-14
"Instead, the requisite shift in the collective external position of the industrial countries was facilitated by adjustments in asset prices and exchange rates, although the pattern of asset-price changes was somewhat different before and after 2000.",2005-04-14
"From about 1996 to early 2000, equity prices played a key equilibrating role in international financial markets.",2005-04-14
"The development and adoption of new technologies and rising productivity in the United States--together with the country's long-standing advantages such as low political risk, strong property rights, and a good regulatory environment--made the U.S. economy exceptionally attractive to international investors during that period.",2005-04-14
"Consequently, capital flowed rapidly into the United States, helping to fuel large appreciations in stock prices and in the value of the dollar.",2005-04-14
"From the saving-investment perspective, the U.S. current account deficit rose as capital investment increased (spurred by perceived profit opportunities) at the same time that the rapid increase in household wealth and expectations of future income gains reduced U.S. residents' perceived need to save.",2005-04-14
Thus the rapid increase in the U.S. current account deficit between 1996 and 2000 was fueled to a significant extent both by increased global saving and the greater interest on the part of foreigners in investing in the United States.,2005-04-14
"After the stock-market decline that began in March 2000, new capital investment and thus the demand for financing waned around the world.",2005-04-14
"Indeed, real interest rates have been relatively low in recent years, not only in the United States but also abroad.",2005-04-14
"For example, in the United States, the ten-year real interest rate implied by the prices of inflation-indexed government bonds has fallen from 4.3 percent in March 2000 to about 1.8 percent today.",2005-04-14
"From a narrow U.S. perspective, these low long-term rates are puzzling; from a global perspective, they may be less so.8 The weakening of new capital investment after the drop in equity prices did not much change the net effect of the global saving glut on the U.S. current account.",2005-04-14
"The transmission mechanism changed, however, as low real interest rates rather than high stock prices became a principal cause of lower U.S. saving.",2005-04-14
"In particular, during the past few years, the key asset-price effects of the global saving glut appear to have occurred in the market for residential investment, as low mortgage rates have supported record levels of home construction and strong gains in housing prices.",2005-04-14
"As U.S. business investment has recently begun a cyclical recovery while residential investment has remained strong, the domestic saving shortfall has continued to widen, implying a rise in the current account deficit and increasing dependence of the United States on capital inflows.9 According to the story I have sketched thus far, events outside U.S. borders--such as the financial crises that induced emerging-market countries to switch from being international borrowers to international lenders--have played an important role in the evolution of the U.S. current account deficit, with transmission occurring primarily through endogenous changes in equity values, house prices, real interest rates, and the exchange value of the dollar.",2005-04-14
The effects of the saving outflow may thus have been felt disproportionately on U.S. interest rates and the dollar.,2005-04-14
"As shown in table 1, a number of key industrial countries other than the United States have seen their current accounts move substantially toward deficit since 1996, including France, Italy, Spain, Australia, and the United Kingdom.",2005-04-14
"A key difference between the two groups of countries is that the countries whose current accounts have moved toward deficit have generally experienced substantial housing appreciation and increases in household wealth, while Germany and Japan--whose economies have been growing slowly despite very low interest rates--have not.",2005-04-14
"For example, since 1996 wealth-to-income ratios have risen by 14 percent in France, 12 percent in Italy, and 27 percent in the United Kingdom; each of these countries has seen their current account move toward deficit, as already noted.",2005-04-14
"By contrast, wealth-to-income ratios in Germany and Japan have remained flat.10 The evident link between rising household wealth and a tendency for the current account to shift toward deficit is consistent with the mechanism that I have described today.",2005-04-14
Economic and Policy Implications I have presented today a somewhat unconventional explanation of the high and rising U.S. current account deficit.,2005-04-14
"This increased supply of saving boosted U.S. equity values during the period of the stock market boom and helped to increase U.S. home values during the more recent period, as a consequence lowering U.S. national saving and contributing to the nation's rising current account deficit.",2005-04-14
"If financial capital were to flow in this ""natural"" direction, savers in the industrial countries would potentially earn higher returns and enjoy increased diversification, and borrowers in the developing world would have the funds to make the capital investments needed to promote growth and higher living standards.",2005-04-14
A second issue concerns the uses of international credit in the United States and other industrial countries with external deficits.,2005-04-14
"Because investment by businesses in equipment and structures has been relatively low in recent years (for cyclical and other reasons) and because the tax and financial systems in the United States and many other countries are designed to promote homeownership, much of the recent capital inflow into the developed world has shown up in higher rates of home construction and in higher home prices.",2005-04-14
Higher home prices in turn have encouraged households to increase their consumption.,2005-04-14
"However, in the long run, productivity gains are more likely to be driven by nonresidential investment, such as business purchases of new machines.",2005-04-14
"In the United States, for example, the growth in export-oriented sectors such as manufacturing has been restrained by the U.S. trade imbalance (although the recent decline in the dollar has alleviated that pressure somewhat), while sectors producing nontraded goods and services, such as home construction, have grown rapidly.",2005-04-14
The relative shrinkage in those industries in the presence of current account deficits--a shrinkage that may well have to be reversed in the future--imposes real costs of adjustment on firms and workers in those industries.,2005-04-14
"Finally, the large current account deficit of the United States, in particular, requires substantial flows of foreign financing.",2005-04-14
"As I have discussed today, the underlying sources of the U.S. current account deficit appear to be medium-term or even long-term in nature, suggesting that the situation will eventually begin to improve, although a return to approximate balance may take some time.",2005-04-14
What policy options exist to deal with the U.S. current account deficit?,2005-04-14
"I have downplayed the role of the U.S. federal budget deficit today, and I disagree with the view, sometimes heard, that balancing the federal budget by itself would largely defuse the current account issue.",2005-04-14
"In particular, to the extent that a reduction in the federal budget resulted in lower interest rates, the principal effects might be increased consumption and investment spending at home rather than a lower current account deficit.",2005-04-14
"Indeed, a recent study suggests that a $1.00 reduction in the federal budget deficit would cause the current account deficit to decline less than $0.20 (Erceg, Guerrieri, and Gust, 2005).",2005-04-14
"These results imply that even if we could balance the federal budget tomorrow, the medium-term effect would likely be to reduce the current account deficit by less than one percentage point of GDP.",2005-04-14
"Although I do not believe that plausible near-term changes in the federal budget would eliminate the current account deficit, I should stress that reducing the federal budget deficit is still a good idea.",2005-04-14
"Although the effects on the current account of reining in the budget deficit would likely be relatively modest, at least the direction is right.",2005-04-14
"Moreover, there are other good reasons to bring down the federal budget deficit, including the reduction of the debt obligations that will have to be serviced by taxpayers in the future.",2005-04-14
"Although the effect of saving-friendly policies on the U.S. current account deficit might not be dramatic, again the direction would be right.",2005-04-14
"Moreover, increasing U.S. national saving from its current low level would support productivity and wealth creation and help our society make better provision for the future.",2005-04-14
"However, as I have argued today, some of the key reasons for the large U.S. current account deficit are external to the United States, implying that purely inward-looking policies are unlikely to resolve this issue.",2005-04-14
"For example, the pace at which emerging-market countries are accumulating international reserves should slow as they increasingly perceive their reserves to be adequate and as they move toward more flexible exchange rates.",2005-04-14
"""1 However, the Federal Reserve met this mandate principally by issuing currency as needed to damp seasonal fluctuations in interest rates, and during its early years the Federal Reserve did not monitor the money stock or even collect monetary data in a systematic way.2, 3 The Federal Reserveâ€™s first fifteen years were a period of relative prosperity, but the crash of 1929 ushered in a decade of global financial instability and economic depression.",2006-11-10
"His definition, which included currency and demand deposits, corresponded closely to what we now call M1.",2006-11-10
"Currie argued that collection of monetary data was necessary for the Federal Reserve to control the money supply, which in turn would facilitate the stabilization of the price level and of the economy more generally.4 In 1934, Marriner Eccles asked Currie to join the Treasury Department, and later that year, when Eccles was appointed to head the Federal Reserve, he took Currie with him.",2006-11-10
"This effort culminated in 1943 with the publication of Banking and Monetary Statistics, which included annual figures on demand and time deposits from 1892 and on currency from 1860.",2006-11-10
"Milton Friedmanâ€™s volume Studies in the Quantity Theory of Money, which contained Phillip Caganâ€™s work on money and hyperinflation, appeared in 1956, followed in 1960 by Friedmanâ€™s A Program for Monetary Stability, which advocated that monetary policy engineer a constant growth rate for the money stock.",2006-11-10
"To accommodate these innovations, alternative definitions of money were created; by 1971, the Federal Reserve published data for five definitions of money, denoted M1 through M5.6 During the early years of monetary measurement, policymakers groped for ways to use the new data.7 However, during the 1960s and 1970s, as researchers and policymakers struggled to understand the sharp increase in inflation, the view that nominal aggregates (including credit as well as monetary aggregates) are closely linked to spending growth and inflation gained ground.",2006-11-10
"In 1966, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) began to add a proviso to its policy directives that bank credit growth should not deviate significantly from projections; a similar proviso about money growth was added in 1970.",2006-11-10
"In 1974, the FOMC began to specify ""ranges of tolerance"" for the growth of M1 and for the broader M2 monetary aggregate over the period that extended to the next meeting of the Committee.8 In response to House Concurrent Resolution 133 in 1975, the Federal Reserve began to report annual target growth ranges, 2 to 3 percentage points wide, for M1, M2, a still broader aggregate M3, and bank credit in semiannual testimony before the Congress.",2006-11-10
"In an amendment to the Federal Reserve Act in 1977, the Congress formalized the Federal Reserveâ€™s reporting of monetary targets by directing the Board to ""maintain long run growth of monetary and credit aggregates â€¦ so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.",2006-11-10
"""9 In practice, however, the adoption of targets for money and credit growth was evidently not effective in constraining policy or in reducing inflation, in part because the target was not routinely achieved.10 The closest the Federal Reserve came to a ""monetarist experiment"" began in October 1979, when the FOMC under Chairman Paul Volcker adopted an operating procedure based on the management of non-borrowed reserves.11 The intent was to focus policy on controlling the growth of M1 and M2 and thereby to reduce inflation, which had been running at double-digit rates.",2006-11-10

"For example, in the mid-1970s, just when the FOMC began to specify money growth targets, econometric estimates of M1 money demand relationships began to break down, predicting faster money growth than was actually observed.",2006-11-10
"This breakdown--dubbed ""the case of the missing money"" by Princeton economist Stephen Goldfeld (1976)--significantly complicated the selection of appropriate targets for money growth.",2006-11-10
"Similar problems arose in the early 1980s--the period of the Volcker experiment--when the introduction of new types of bank accounts again made M1 money demand difficult to predict.12 Attempts to find stable relationships between M1 growth and growth in other nominal quantities were unsuccessful, and formal growth rate targets for M1 were discontinued in 1987.",2006-11-10
Econometric methods were also refined to improve estimation and to accommodate more-complex dynamics in money demand equations.,2006-11-10
"For example, at a 1988 conference at the Federal Reserve Board, George Moore, Richard Porter, and David Small presented a new set of M2 money demand models based on an ""error-correction"" specification, which allowed for transitory deviations from stable long-run relationships (Moore, Porter, and Small, 1990).",2006-11-10
"About the same time, Board staff developed the so-called P* (P-star) model, based on M2, which used the quantity theory of money and estimates of long-run potential output and velocity (the ratio of nominal income to money) to predict long-run inflation trends.",2006-11-10
"Indeed, the discrepancy between actual and predicted money growth was sufficiently large that the P* model, if not subjected to judgmental adjustments, would have predicted deflation for 1991 and 1992.",2006-11-10
"As a consequence, cross-border currency flows, which can be estimated only imprecisely, may lead to sharp changes in currency outstanding and in the monetary base that are largely unrelated to domestic conditions.15, 16 The Board staff continues to devote considerable effort to modeling and forecasting velocity and money demand.",2006-11-10
"The standard model of money demand, which relates money held to measures of income and opportunity cost, has been extended to include alternative measures of money and its determinants, to accommodate special factors and structural breaks, and to allow for complex dynamic behavior of the money stock.17 Forecasts of money growth are based on expert judgment with input from various estimated models and with knowledge of special factors that are expected to be relevant.",2006-11-10

"For example, the Bundesbank, though it conducted short-term policy with reference to targets for money supply growth, derived those targets each year by calculating the rate of money growth estimated to be consistent with the bank's long-run desired rate of inflation, normally 2 percent per year.",2003-03-25
"Hence, the Bundesbank indirectly targeted inflation, using money growth as a quantitative indicator to aid in the calibration of its policy.",2003-03-25
"Notably, the evidence suggests that, when conflicts arose between its money growth targets and inflation targets, the Bundesbank generally chose to give greater weight to its inflation targets (Bernanke and Mihov, 1997).1 The inflation-targeting approach became more explicit with the strategies adopted in the early 1990s by a number of pioneering central banks, among them the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, Sweden's Riksbank, and the Reserve Bank of Australia.",2003-03-25
"Over the past decade, variants of inflation targeting have proliferated, with newly industrialized and emerging-market economies (Brazil, Chile, Israel, Korea, Mexico, South Africa, the Philippines, and Thailand, among others) being among the most enthusiastic initiates.",2003-03-25
"Most recently, this policy framework has also been adopted by several transition economies, notably the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland.2 Central banks that have switched to inflation targeting have generally been pleased with the results they have obtained.",2003-03-25
"The strongest evidence on that score is that, thus far at least, none of the several dozen adopters of inflation targeting has abandoned the approach.3 As an academic interested in monetary policy, several years ago I became intrigued by inflation targeting and went on to co-author a book and several other pieces about this approach.4 As I continue to follow developments in the area, I must say, however, that discussions of inflation targeting in the American media remind me of the way some Americans deal with the metric system--they don't really know what it is, but they think of it as foreign, impenetrable, and possibly slightly subversive.",2003-03-25
"So, in the hope of cutting through some of the fog, today I will offer my own, perhaps somewhat idiosyncratic, view of inflation targeting and its potential benefits, at least in what I consider to be its best-practice form.5 I will also try to dispel what I feel are a few misconceptions about inflation targeting that have gained some currency.",2003-03-25
"Finally, I will end with a few words, and one modest suggestion, about the implications of the experience with inflation targeting for the practice of monetary policymaking at the Federal Reserve.6 My main objective today, however, is to clarify, not to advocate.",2003-03-25
Best-Practice Inflation Targeting: One View Although inflation targeting has a number of distinguishing features--the announcement of a quantitative target for inflation being the most obvious--capturing the essence of the approach is not entirely straightforward.,2003-03-25
"The central banks that call themselves inflation targeters, as well as the economies they represent, are a diverse group indeed, and (not surprisingly) institutional and operational features differ.",2003-03-25
"Moreover, many central banks that have not formally adopted the framework of inflation targeting have clearly been influenced by the approach (or, if you prefer, the same ideas and trends have influenced both inflation-targeters and non-inflation-targeters).",2003-03-25
"For example, over the past twenty years, the Federal Reserve, though rejecting the inflation-targeting label, has greatly increased its credibility for maintaining low and stable inflation, has become more proactive in heading off inflationary pressures, and has worked hard to improve the transparency of its policymaking process--all hallmarks of the inflation-targeting approach.",2003-03-25
"In short, to draw a bright line between central banks practicing full-fledged inflation targeting and those firmly outside the inflation-targeting camp is more difficult than one might first guess--a fact, by the way, that substantially complicates economists' attempts to assess empirically the effects of this approach.",2003-03-25
"Nevertheless, for expository purposes, I find it useful to break down the inflation targeting approach into two components: (1) a particular framework for making policy choices, and (2) a strategy for communicating the context and rationale of these policy choices to the broader public.",2003-03-25
"Let's call these two components of inflation targeting the policy framework and the communications strategy, for short.",2003-03-25
"The policy framework of inflation targeting By the policy framework I mean the principles by which the policy committee decides how to set its policy instrument, typically a short-term interest rate.",2003-03-25
"In an earlier speech, I referred to the policy framework that describes what I consider to be best-practice inflation targeting as constrained discretion.7 Constrained discretion attempts to strike a balance between the inflexibility of strict policy rules and the potential lack of discipline and structure inherent in unfettered policymaker discretion.",2003-03-25
"Under constrained discretion, the central bank is free to do its best to stabilize output and employment in the face of short-run disturbances, with the appropriate caution born of our imperfect knowledge of the economy and of the effects of policy (this is the ""discretion"" part of constrained discretion).",2003-03-25
"However, a crucial proviso is that, in conducting stabilization policy, the central bank must also maintain a strong commitment to keeping inflation--and, hence, public expectations of inflation--firmly under control (the ""constrained"" part of constrained discretion).",2003-03-25
"Because monetary policy influences inflation with a lag, keeping inflation under control may require the central bank to anticipate future movements in inflation and move preemptively.",2003-03-25
"Although constrained discretion acknowledges the crucial role that monetary policy plays in stabilizing the real economy, this policy framework does place heavy weight on the proposition that maintenance of low and stable inflation is a key element--perhaps I should say the key element--of successful monetary policy.",2003-03-25
"The rationale for this emphasis goes well beyond the direct benefits of price stability for economic efficiency and growth, important as these are.",2003-03-25
"The maintenance of price stability--and equally important, the development by the central bank of a strong reputation for and commitment to it--also serves to anchor the private sector's expectations of future inflation.",2003-03-25
Well-anchored inflation expectations (by which I mean that the public continues to expect low and stable inflation even if actual inflation temporarily deviates from its expected level) not only make price stability much easier to achieve in the long term but also increase the central bank's ability to stabilize output and employment in the short run.,2003-03-25
"Short-run stabilization of output and employment is more effective when inflation expectations are well anchored because the central bank need not worry that, for example, a policy easing will lead counterproductively to rising inflation and inflation expectations rather than to stronger real activity.",2003-03-25
"In my earlier speech, I gave the Great Inflation of the 1970s in the United States as an example of what can happen when inflation expectations are not well anchored.",2003-03-25
"Contrary to the belief in a long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment held by many economists in the 1960s, unemployment and inflation in the 1970s were both high and unstable.",2003-03-25
Even today conventional wisdom ascribes this unexpected outcome to the oil price shocks of the 1970s.,2003-03-25
"Though increases in oil prices were certainly adverse factors, poor monetary policies in the second half of the 1960s and in the 1970s both facilitated the rise in oil prices themselves and substantially exacerbated their effects on the economy.",2003-03-25
Monetary policy contributed to the oil price increases in the first place by creating an inflationary environment in which excess nominal demand existed for a wide range of goods and services.,2003-03-25
"For example, in an important paper, Barsky and Kilian (2001) noted that the prices of many industrial commodities and raw materials rose in the 1970s about the same time as oil prices, reflecting broad-based inflationary pressures.",2003-03-25
"Without these general inflationary pressures, it is unlikely that the oil producers would have been able to make the large increases in oil prices ""stick"" for any length of time.",2003-03-25
"Besides helping to make the oil price increases possible, the legacy of poor monetary policies also exacerbated the effects of the oil price increases on output and employment.",2003-03-25
"When the oil price shocks hit, beginning in 1973, inflation expectations had already become very unstable, after several years of increased inflationary pressures and a failed program of price controls under President Nixon.",2003-03-25
"Because inflation expectations were no longer anchored, the widely publicized oil price increases were rapidly transmitted into expectations of higher general inflation and, hence, into higher wage demands and other cost pressures.",2003-03-25
"Faced with an unprecedented inflationary surge, the Fed was forced to tighten policy.",2003-03-25
"As it turned out, the Fed's tightening was not enough to contain the inflationary surge but was sufficient to generate a severe recession.",2003-03-25
The upshot is that the deep 1973-75 recession was caused only in part by increases in oil prices per se.,2003-03-25
"An equally important source of the recession was several years of overexpansionary monetary policy that squandered the Fed's credibility regarding inflation, with the ultimate result that the economic impact of the oil producers' actions was significantly larger than it had to be.",2003-03-25
"Instability in both prices and the real economy continued for the rest of the decade, until the Fed under Chairman Paul Volcker re-established the Fed's credibility with the painful disinflationary episode of 1980-82.",2003-03-25
This latter episode and its enormous costs should also be chalked up to the failure to keep inflation and inflation expectations low and stable.,2003-03-25
"In contrast to the 1970s, fluctuations in oil prices have had far smaller effects on both inflation and output in the United States and other industrialized countries since the early 1980s.",2003-03-25
"In part this more moderate effect reflects increased energy efficiency and other structural changes, but I believe the dominant reason is that the use of constrained discretion in the making of monetary policy has led to better anchoring of inflation expectations in the great majority of industrial countries.",2003-03-25
"Because inflation expectations are now more firmly tied down, surges and declines in energy prices do not significantly affect core inflation and thus do not force a policy response to inflation to the extent they did three decades ago.",2003-03-25
"Indeed, rather than leading to a tightening of monetary policy, increases in oil prices today are more likely to promote consideration of increased policy ease--a direct and important benefit of the improved control of inflation.",2003-03-25
"The communications strategy of inflation targeting The second major element of best-practice inflation targeting (in my view) is the communications strategy, the central bank's regular procedures for communicating with the political authorities, the financial markets, and the general public.",2003-03-25
"In general, a central bank's communications strategy, closely linked to the idea of transparency, has many aspects and many motivations.8 Aspects of communication that have been particularly emphasized by inflation-targeting central banks are the public announcement of policy objectives (notably, the objective for inflation), open discussion of the bank's policy framework (including in some cases, but not all, a timeframe for achieving the inflation objective), and public release of the central bank's forecast or evaluation of the economy (as reported, for example, in the Inflation Reports issued by a number of inflation-targeting central banks).9 Why have inflation-targeting central banks emphasized communication, particularly the communication of policy objectives, policy framework, and economic forecasts?",2003-03-25
"Most inflation-targeting central banks have found that effective communication policies are a useful way, in effect, to make the private sector a partner in the policymaking process.",2003-03-25
"In the extreme, I suppose a central bank could run a ""Marcel Marceau"" monetary policy, allowing its actions to convey all its intended meaning.",2003-03-25
"For illustration of the potential benefits to policymakers of even modest self-imposed restrictions on flexibility, consider fiscal policy, which shares with monetary policy some of the same issues that arise when a group of shifting membership makes a series of policy decisions that have both short-run and long-run implications.",2003-03-25
"True, spending caps, comprehensive budget resolutions, mandatory long-term deficit projections, and similar provisions, to the extent that they are effective, may reduce at least a bit the flexibility of fiscal policymakers.",2003-03-25
"As with fiscal policy, public beliefs about how monetary policy will perform in the long run affect the effectiveness of monetary policy in the short run.",2003-03-25
"Suppose, for example, that the central bank wants to stimulate a weak economy by cutting its policy interest rate.",2003-03-25
"The effect on real activity will be strongest if the public is confident in the central bank's unshakable commitment to price stability, as that confidence will moderate any tendency of wages, prices, or long-term interest rates to rise today in anticipation of possible future inflationary pressures generated by the current easing of policy.",2003-03-25
"From the public's perspective, the central bank's commitment to a policy framework, including a long-run inflation target, imposes the same kind of discipline and accountability on the central bank that a long-term commitment to fiscal stability places on the fiscal authorities.",2003-03-25
"Misconceptions about Inflation Targeting I would like to turn now, briefly, to comment on a few key misconceptions about inflation targeting that have gained some currency in the public debate.",2003-03-25
"Misconception #1: Inflation targeting involves mechanical, rule-like policymaking.",2003-03-25
"As Rick Mishkin and I emphasized in our early expository article (Bernanke and Mishkin, 1997), inflation targeting is a policy framework, not a rule.",2003-03-25
"Inflation targeting provides one particular coherent framework for thinking about monetary policy choices which, importantly, lets the public in on the conversation.",2003-03-25
"If this framework succeeds in its goals of anchoring inflation expectations, it may also make the policymaker's ultimate task easier.",2003-03-25
"But making monetary policy under inflation targeting requires as much insight and judgment as under any policy framework; indeed, inflation targeting can be particularly demanding in that it requires policymakers to give careful, fact-based, and analytical explanations of their actions to the public.",2003-03-25
Misconception #2: Inflation targeting focuses exclusively on control of inflation and ignores output and employment objectives.,2003-03-25
"Several authors have made the distinction between so-called ""strict"" inflation targeting, in which the only objective of the central bank is price stability, and ""flexible"" inflation targeting, which allows attention to output and employment as well.",2003-03-25
"In the early days of inflation targeting, this distinction may have been a useful one, as a number of inflation-targeting central banks talked the language of strict inflation targeting and one or two came close to actually practicing it.",2003-03-25
"For quite a few years now, however, strict inflation targeting has been without significant practical relevance.",2003-03-25
"In particular, I am not aware of any real-world central bank (the language of its mandate notwithstanding) that does not treat the stabilization of employment and output as an important policy objective.",2003-03-25
"To use the wonderful phrase coined by Mervyn King, the Governor-designate of the inflation-targeting Bank of England, there are no ""inflation nutters"" heading major central banks.10 Moreover, virtually all (I am tempted to say ""all"") recent research on inflation targeting takes for granted that stabilization of output and employment is an important policy objective of the central bank.",2003-03-25
"In short, in both theory and practice, today all inflation targeting is of the flexible variety.11 A second, more serious, issue is the relative weight, or ranking, of inflation and unemployment (or, more precisely, the output gap) among the central bank's objectives.",2003-03-25
"Countries differ in this regard, both in formal mandate and in actual practice.12 As an extensive academic literature shows, however, the general approach of inflation targeting is fully consistent with any set of relative social weights on inflation and unemployment; the approach can be applied equally well by ""inflation hawks,"" ""growth hawks,"" and anyone in between.",2003-03-25
"What I find particularly appealing about constrained discretion, which is the heart of the inflation-targeting approach, is the possibility of using it to get better results in terms of both inflation and employment.",2003-03-25
"Personally, I subscribe unreservedly to the Humphrey-Hawkins dual mandate, and I would not be interested in the inflation-targeting approach if I didn't think it was the best available technology for achieving both sets of policy objectives.13 Misconception #3: Inflation targeting is inconsistent with the central bank's obligation to maintain financial stability.",2003-03-25
"I see no conflict between that role and inflation targeting (indeed, inflation targeting seems to require the preservation of financial stability as part of preserving macroeconomic stability), and I have never heard a proponent of inflation targeting argue otherwise.14 Inflation Targeting and the Federal Reserve As I noted earlier, the Federal Reserve, though rejecting any explicit affiliation with inflation targeting, has been influenced by many of the same ideas that have influenced self-described inflation targeters.",2003-03-25
"Increasingly greater transparency and more forward-looking, proactive policy are two examples of convergence in practice between the Fed and inflation-targeting central banks, and I think most would agree that both of these developments have been positive and have led to better outcomes.",2003-03-25
"Most important, however, as I discussed in the earlier speech, under Chairman Volcker and Chairman Greenspan, the Fed has moved gradually toward a policy framework of constrained discretion.15 In particular, through two decades of effort the Fed has restored its credibility for maintaining low and stable inflation, which--as theory suggests--has had the important benefit of increasing the institution's ability to respond to shocks to the real economy.",2003-03-25

"Personally, though, I believe that U.S. monetary policy would be better in the long run if the Fed chose to make its policy framework somewhat more explicit.",2003-03-25
"Second, making the Fed's inflation goals and its medium-term projections for the economy more explicit would reduce uncertainty and assist planning in financial markets and in the economy more generally.",2003-03-25
"Finally, any additional anchoring of inflation expectations that we can achieve now will only be helpful in the future.",2003-03-25
"To move substantially further in the direction of inflation targeting, should it choose to do so, the Fed would have to take two principal steps: first, to quantify (numerically, and in terms of a specific price index) what the Federal Open Market Committee means by ""price stability"", and second, to publish regular medium-term projections or forecasts of the economic outlook, analogous to the Inflation Reports published by both inflation-targeting central banks.",2003-03-25
"Particularly now that we are in the general range of price stability, I believe that quantifying what the FOMC means by price stability would provide useful information to the public and lend additional clarity to the policymaking process.",2003-03-25
"Despite the potential long-run benefits of such a change, FOMC members may be concerned at this juncture that the Congress and the public would misperceive the quantification of price stability as an elevation of the Fed's price stability objective above its employment objective in violation of the dual mandate, even if that were in no way the intention.",2003-03-25
"Although personally I have no doubt that quantification of the price stability objective is fully consistent with the current dual mandate, I also appreciate the delicate issues of communication raised by such a change.",2003-03-25
"I hope that my talk today contributes to that discussion.16 The publication of medium-term forecasts does not raise nearly the same difficult political and communication issues that quantification of price stability may, in my view, and so I propose it here as a more feasible short-term step.",2003-03-25
"The FOMC already releases (and has released since 1979) a range and a ""central tendency"" of its projections for nominal GDP growth, real GDP growth, PCE inflation, and the civilian unemployment rate twice each year, publishing them as part of the semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.17 These projections are actually quite interesting, as they represent the views of Fed policymakers of the future evolution of the economy, conditional on what each policymaker views as the best path for future policy.",2003-03-25
I think it would be very useful to detach these projections from the Monetary Policy Report and instead release them shortly after the meetings (in January and July) at which they are compiled.,2003-03-25
"In particular, the FOMC projections would convey the policymakers' sense of the medium-term evolution of the economy, providing insight into both the Fed's diagnosis of economic conditions and its policy objectives.18 Ideally, the release of these projections also would provide occasions for Governors and regional Bank Presidents, drawing on the expertise of their respective staffs, to convey their individual views on the prospects for the economy and the objectives of monetary policy.",2003-03-25
"Conclusion Inflation targeting, at least in its best-practice form, consists of two parts: a policy framework of constrained discretion and a communication strategy that attempts to focus expectations and explain the policy framework to the public.",2003-03-25
"Together, these two elements promote both price stability and well-anchored inflation expectations; the latter in turn facilitates more effective stabilization of output and employment.",2003-03-25
"Thus, a well-conceived and well-executed strategy of inflation targeting can deliver good results with respect to output and employment as well as inflation.",2003-03-25

The report is required to contain “a discussion of the conduct of monetary policy and economic developments and prospects for the future .,2003-03-25
"In recent years, renewed attention has been placed on the role of advanced economies and of common or global factors in driving capital movements.3 In particular, many observers have singled out monetary policy in the United States and other advanced economies as a key driver.",2013-11-04
"As advanced economies pursued highly accommodative monetary policies and EMEs subsequently received strong capital inflows, reflecting investors' pursuit of higher returns, concerns were expressed that a flood of liquidity would overwhelm emerging markets, drive up asset prices to unsustainable levels, set off credit booms, and thus sow the seeds of future crises.",2013-11-04
"In my remarks today, I will discuss the extent to which monetary policy in the advanced economies--and in the United States in particular--has contributed to changes in emerging market capital flows and asset prices, and I will place this discussion in a broader context of economic and financial linkages among economies.",2013-11-04
I will also address the risks that EMEs may face from the eventual normalization of monetary policy in the advanced economies.,2013-11-04
"In the United States, the Federal Reserve is bound by its dual mandate to pursue price stability and maximum employment.",2013-11-04
"The first is forward guidance on the federal funds rate.By lowering private-sector expectations for the future path of short-term rates, forward guidance has reduced longer-term interest rates and raised asset prices, thereby leading to more accommodative financial conditions.",2013-11-04
"The second tool is large scale asset purchases, which likewise increase policy accommodation by reducing longer-term interest rates and raising asset prices.",2013-11-04
"The ECB also purchased some securities in distressed markets, and recently indicated that it expects interest rates to remain low for an extended period.",2013-11-04
"Thus, since the end of the crisis, central banks in the advanced economies have adopted similar policies to promote recovery and price stability.",2013-11-04
"While a great deal of attention has focused on unconventional policy actions, especially asset purchases, these policies appear to affect financial conditions and the real economy in much the same way as conventional interest rate policy.",2013-11-04
"Indeed, recent research suggests that adjustments in policy rates and unconventional policies have similar cross-border effects on asset prices and economic outcomes.4 ; If that is so, then the overall stance of policy accommodation matters more here than the particular form of easing Moreover, neither conventional nor unconventional monetary policy actions are shocks that come out of the blue.",2013-11-04
"Thus, any spillovers from monetary policy actions must be evaluated against the consequences of failing to respond to these adverse shocks.",2013-11-04
"Spillovers from advanced-economy monetary policies are to be expected.5 In theory, when advanced economies ease monetary policy in response to a contractionary shock, their interest rates will decline, prompting investors to rebalance their portfolios toward higher-yielding assets.",2013-11-04
"In response, EME currencies should tend to appreciate against those of the advanced economies, and EME asset prices should rise.",2013-11-04
"Conversely, a tightening of advanced economy monetary policy in response to a stronger economy should lead these movements to reverse; that is, tightening should reduce capital flows to EMEs and diminish upward pressure on EME currencies and asset prices.",2013-11-04
"If interest rates were the main driver of capital flows, these two series ought to move in a similar fashion.",2013-11-04
"At times, this is indeed the case: From mid-2009 to early 2011, the interest rate differential and EME capital inflows rose together.",2013-11-04
"In early 2007, capital flows to EMEs were quite strong even with a low interest rate differential.",2013-11-04
"And in mid-2011, capital inflows stepped down even as the interest rate differential remained elevated.",2013-11-04
"As I will discuss in a moment, the lack of a tight relationship between capital flows and interest rates suggests that other factors also have been important.",2013-11-04
"Even though interest-rate differentials and capital inflows do not always move in the same direction, numerous empirical studies have shown that interest rates do in fact help explain capital flows once other determinants of these flows are also taken into account.6 In particular, when U.S. rates decline relative to those in EMEs, private capital flows to EMEs tend to rise, consistent with investors rebalancing toward higher-yielding assets.",2013-11-04
"In a similar vein, event studies have shown that the Federal Reserve's policy announcements, including those related to asset purchases, have been associated with capital flows to EMEs as well as upward movements in EME currencies and asset prices.7 But the role of monetary policy in driving capital flows and the effects of those flows on EMEs should not be overstated.",2013-11-04
"First, many factors affect capital flows to EMEs, not just the stance of advanced economy monetary policy.",2013-11-04
Differences in growth prospects across countries and the associated differences in expected investment returns are important factors.8 Chart 2 shows the growth rate of real GDP for EMEs and advanced economies.,2013-11-04
"As shown by the line in the right panel, EME growth has, in fact, consistently outpaced that of the advanced economies.",2013-11-04
"In addition, the bounceback of the EMEs from the global financial crisis widened this differential even more, although the gap has diminished more recently as growth in the EMEs has slowed.",2013-11-04
"Moreover, investing in EMEs has become more attractive as many EMEs have improved their macroeconomic policies and institutional frameworks over recent decades; growth differentials may partly be reflecting these improvements.",2013-11-04
"As is evident in the right-hand chart, the relationship between the growth differential and capital inflows to EMEs seems to be quite strong.",2013-11-04
"In particular, the rise in capital flows following the global financial crisis coincided with stronger relative growth performance in EMEs.",2013-11-04
"And in 2011, capital inflows diminished along with the growth differential.",2013-11-04
"Swings in sentiment between ""risk-on"" and ""risk-off"" have led investors to reposition across asset classes, resulting in corresponding movements in capital flows.9 Indeed, as shown in chart 3, the most common measure of uncertainty and the market price of volatility--the VIX--is strongly correlated with net inflows into EMEs.",2013-11-04
"Of course, movements in risk sentiment may not be fully independent of monetary policy.",2013-11-04
An interesting line of research has begun to consider how changes in monetary policy itself may affect risk sentiment.,2013-11-04
"For example, some studies indicate that an easing of U.S. monetary policy tends to lower volatility (as measured by the VIX), increase leverage of financial intermediaries, and boost EME capital inflows and currencies.10 A second point to bear in mind when assessing monetary policy spillovers is that expansionary policies in the advanced economies are not beggar-thy-neighbor; in other words, they do not undermine exports from EMEs.",2013-11-04
"In recent decades, some EMEs have successfully pursued an export-led growth strategy, and policymakers in those economies have sometimes expressed concern that their exports will be unduly restrained as accommodative policies in the advanced economies lead their currencies to appreciate.",2013-11-04
"However, as shown in chart 4, although EME currencies bounced back from their lows during the global financial crisis--when global investors fled from assets they perceived to be risky--for many EMEs real exchange rates have moved sideways or have even declined over the past two years.",2013-11-04
"But even if advanced economy monetary policies were to put upward pressure on EME currencies, the consequent drag on their exports must be weighed against the positive effects of stronger demand in the advanced economies.",2013-11-04
"Over the longer run, advanced economy policy actions that strengthen global growth and global trade will benefit the EMEs as well.",2013-11-04
"Because many EMEs have financial sectors that are relatively small, large capital inflows may foster asset price bubbles and a too-rapid expansion of credit.",2013-11-04
"While the picture is a mixed one and some markets show signs of froth, indicators of financial stability do not seem to show widespread imbalances.12 For example, EME equity prices, shown in chart 5, plunged during the global financial crisis, rebounded thereafter, but then generally flattened out or even declined.",2013-11-04
"But in aggregate, EME stock prices remain below their pre-crisis peak, whereas the S&P 500 is well above its own pre-crisis peak.",2013-11-04
"Credit growth in China is particularly noteworthy, but this does not seem to be the result of accommodative monetary policies in the advanced economies.",2013-11-04
"In addition, China's relatively closed capital account limits the extent to which domestic credit conditions are influenced by developments abroad, including changes in advanced economy monetary policy.",2013-11-04
"Increases in credit in some other economies, notably Brazil, have also been driven to a significant degree by policy actions to support aggregate demand.",2013-11-04
Another area of potential concern is excessive valuations in property markets.Chart 7 displays inflation-adjusted house prices for several Asian economies.,2013-11-04
"The most striking increases have occurred in Hong Kong, which, through its open capital account and essentially fixed exchange rate, is tied most directly to U.S. financial conditions.",2013-11-04
"Of course, the degree of Hong Kong's exposure to U.S. financial conditions is a policy choice, and other factors have also contributed to the run-up in its property prices.",2013-11-04
House prices have also resumed their rise in China.,2013-11-04
"But, as with credit growth, this rise seems to reflect domestic developments as opposed to spillovers from global financial conditions.",2013-11-04
"To summarize my discussion so far, EMEs clearly face challenges from volatile capital flows and the attendant moves in asset prices.",2013-11-04
"Accommodative monetary policies in the advanced economies have likely contributed to some of these flow and price pressures, and may also have contributed to the buildup of some financial vulnerabilities in certain emerging markets.",2013-11-04
"Moreover, expansionary monetary policies in the advanced economies have supported global growth to the benefit of advanced and emerging economies alike.",2013-11-04
"As shown in chart 8, from May through August, U.S. Treasury yields rose substantially as market participants reassessed the future course of U.S. monetary policy.",2013-11-04
The magnitude of these market responses may have been amplified by the carry-trade strategies that many investors had in place; these strategies were designed to take advantage of interest rate differentials and appeared profitable as long as EME interest rate differentials remained wide and EME exchange rates remained stable or were expected to appreciate.,2013-11-04
"When anticipations of Fed tapering led to higher U.S. interest rates and higher market volatility, these trades may have been quickly unwound, engendering particularly sharp declines in EME exchange rates and asset prices.",2013-11-04
"These developments, however, do not appear to have been driven solely by perceptions of U.S. monetary policy.",2013-11-04
"As I noted earlier, GDP growth in many EMEs has fallen from the pace of previous years, which may have led investors to rethink their investment choices.",2013-11-04
"Asset prices have fallen considerably more in economies with large current account deficits, high inflation, and fiscal problems than in countries with stronger fundamentals.",2013-11-04
"For example, as shown in chart 9, changes in EME exchange rates and interest rates since April have been correlated with current account deficits.",2013-11-04
"In general, economies with larger current account deficits experienced greater depreciations of their currencies and larger increases in their bond yields.",2013-11-04
"Thus, while a reassessment of U.S. monetary policy may have triggered the recent retrenchment from EMEs, investor concerns about underlying vulnerabilities appear to have amplified the reaction.",2013-11-04
"Whatever their source, large capital outflows from EMEs can pose challenges for EME policymakers by simultaneously producing significant currency depreciation, asset price deflation, and inflationary pressures.",2013-11-04
"In such cases, EME central banks are in the difficult position of judging whether to tighten policy at the same time that demand is weakening.",2013-11-04
It is notable that some central banks with stronger records on price stability have been able to avoid tightening whereas others have been forced to raise rates to defend price stability in the face of domestic weakness.,2013-11-04
"Monetary policy in the United States is likely to remain highly accommodative for some time, as our economy fights to overcome the remaining headwinds from the global financial crisis.",2013-11-04
"While moderating the pace of purchases and the eventual increase in the federal funds rate may well affect capital flows, interest rates and asset prices in EMEs, the overall macroeconomic effects need not be disruptive.",2013-11-04
"First, tightening will in all likelihood occur in the context of a more firmly established economic recovery in the United States so that any adverse effects on EME financial conditions should be buffered by the beneficial effects of higher external demand.",2013-11-04
"Second, although conditions vary from country to country, on the whole, EMEs exhibit greater resilience than they did in prior decades, reflecting, among other factors, more flexible exchange rates, greater stocks of international reserves, stronger fiscal positions, and better regulated and more conservatively managed banking systems.",2013-11-04
"EMEs have policy tools to help manage any negative externalities that may arise, and recent developments provide additional rationale for them to redouble their efforts to bolster their resiliency.14 Reducing vulnerabilities, improving policy frameworks, and safeguarding the financial sector will go a long way toward making EMEs more robust to a wide range of shocks, not just those that may arise from changes in monetary policy in the advanced economies.",2013-11-04
"In order for the Federal Reserve to fulfill its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment, we must take account of these international linkages.",2013-11-04
"We are closing in on full employment, inflation is moving gradually toward our target, foreign growth is on more solid footing, and risks to the outlook are as close to balanced as they have been in some time.",2017-03-01
"Assuming continued progress, it will likely be appropriate soon to remove additional accommodation, continuing on a gradual path.1 As normalization of the federal funds rate gets further under way, monetary policy too is approaching a transition, prompting increased focus on the balance sheet.",2017-03-01
"Progress at Home and Abroad Over the past several quarters, we have seen improvement in inflation and activity both at home and abroad following a period when the drag on domestic activity from abroad was considerable.",2017-03-01
"Between the middle of 2014 and 2016, a combination of notable fragilities and risks in large foreign economies, elevated sensitivity of the dollar to policy divergence, a sharp decline in oil prices, and financial markets' heightened sensitivity to these downside risks slowed progress in the U.S. economy and the adjustment of monetary policy to an extent few had anticipated.",2017-03-01
The improvement in the global risk outlook was also helped by the continued economic progress and the gradual pace of monetary policy adjustment in the United States last year.,2017-03-01
"In recent quarters, market participants appear more confident that China has the will and capacity to maintain its exchange rate regime, while achieving its growth targets, although there is a tension with high credit growth that will eventually need to be addressed.",2017-03-01
"Early last year, China's gross domestic product (GDP) growth, which had averaged nearly 8 percent over the previous five years, was only a little above an annual rate of 5 percent in the first quarter, according to official data, and many observers believe that actual growth was weaker.",2017-03-01
"In response, Chinese authorities boosted the supply of credit, ramped up fiscal stimulus, initiated new communications regarding the exchange rate, and clamped down on capital outflows.",2017-03-01
These actions appear to have stabilized growth and calmed fears of financial instability stemming from a sudden large devaluation in the renminbi.,2017-03-01
GDP growth rebounded to an average annual pace of over 7 percent in the final three quarters of the year.,2017-03-01

"Activity in Japan has also picked up recently, with GDP increasing 1-1/2 percent last year--noticeably above the estimated rate of potential growth--and the unemployment rate declining 1/4 percentage point to 3 percent, as monetary policy has remained supportive.",2017-03-01
"In China, the price of near-term stability has been an increase in leverage, particularly in the corporate sector.",2017-03-01
"China's overall debt-GDP ratio is elevated for an emerging market economy, especially considering that Chinese growth is likely to slow noticeably in coming years.",2017-03-01
"In Japan, core consumer price inflation is close to zero--well below the central bank's 2 percent target--and scope for additional monetary policy accommodation is limited, leaving the economy vulnerable to adverse demand shocks.",2017-03-01
"In the euro area, growth and inflation may remain low for some time, which could pose challenges for banks with low capital or high amounts of nonperforming loans and for highly-indebted sovereigns.",2017-03-01
"Monthly gains in payroll employment have maintained a pace sufficient to continue eroding labor market slack, and wage growth appears to be moving higher on balance.",2017-03-01
We appear to be closing in on full employment.,2017-03-01
The unemployment rate--after remaining relatively flat from the third quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2016--fell 1/4 percentage point last quarter to 4-3/4 percent.,2017-03-01
"The prime-age employment-to-population ratio remains depressed relative to pre-crisis levels; the share of employees working part time who would prefer full-time work remains elevated; and some measures of wage growth, such as the employment cost index, have increased relatively little in recent years.",2017-03-01
"Most recently, we are also seeing welcome signs of progress on the second leg of our dual mandate after a protracted period of shortfalls from the FOMC target of 2 percent inflation.",2017-03-01
"Recent months have seen a step-up in longer-run inflation compensation, which had dropped to worrisomely low levels last year raising concerns about a softening of inflation expectations to the downside.",2017-03-01
"Both market- and some survey-based measures of inflation expectations remain somewhat low, but there has been some movement in the right direction in the past few months.",2017-03-01
Inflation has moved up lately as the effect of past increases in the dollar and declines in energy prices have faded.,2017-03-01
"The 12-month change in headline personal consumption expenditures (PCE) prices was 1.9 percent in January, although this partly reflects a temporary boost from energy prices.",2017-03-01
Core PCE inflation--which strips out volatile food and energy prices and is a good gauge of future inflation--has also increased.,2017-03-01

"However, some crosscurrents could weigh on aggregate demand this year.",2017-03-01
"The recent increases in longer-term interest rates could restrain housing activity as well as other interest-sensitive areas of demand, and some further pickup in the dollar could weigh on net exports and business investment.",2017-03-01
Recent months have seen an increase in the upside risks to domestic demand.,2017-03-01
"Sentiment has increased along with equity prices, which are up around 10 percent since October.",2017-03-01
"Increased optimism could lead to faster growth in consumption and business investment, although the spending data, thus far, do not suggest a noticeable acceleration.",2017-03-01
"Some of the increase in sentiment and changes in asset prices could be tied to expectations of more expansive fiscal policy, another upside risk.",2017-03-01
"In addition, the progress that we have made over the past year, with the economy closer to meeting full employment and inflation objectives, has contributed to the favorable shift in the balance of risks.",2017-03-01
The increase in upside risks to domestic demand and the diminution of foreign risks together suggest that risks to the outlook are more balanced today than they had been for the preceding two years.,2017-03-01
"Nonetheless, the neutral real rate of interest--or the level of the real federal funds rate that is consistent with output growing close to its potential rate with full employment and stable inflation--is expected to remain low both in the near term and in the longer run, and inflation is only slowly recovering from a protracted period of low levels.",2017-03-01
The nominal neutral interest rate--which adjusts the real neutral rate for the level of inflation--is likely to remain below its historical average even once it reaches its new longer-run normal level.,2017-03-01
"""2 The decision to rely solely on the federal funds rate to remove accommodation initially until normalization is well under way serves an important purpose, in my view.3 With asymmetry in the scope for conventional monetary policy to respond to shocks, there is a benefit to enabling the federal funds rate to rise more quickly than would be possible with a shrinking balance sheet and sooner reach a level that allows for significant reductions if economic conditions deteriorate.4 Even so, recognizing that the median of the Committee projections places the long-run value of the federal funds rate around 3 percent--a very low level by historical standards--some could judge normalization to be well under way before too long.",2017-03-01
"Thus, monetary policy too may be approaching a transition.",2017-03-01
"Once federal funds normalization meets the test of being well under way, triggering an end to the current reinvestment policy, the balance sheet would be set on autopilot, shrinking in a gradual, predictable way until a ""new normal"" has been reached, and then increasing in line with trend increases in the demand for currency thereafter.6 Under this strategy, the balance sheet might be used as an active tool only if adverse shocks push the economy back to the effective lower bound.",2017-03-01
This strategy recognizes that the two policy tools are broadly similar in the ways they affect the economy by indirectly changing the level of interest rates used to finance purchases by households and businesses.,2017-03-01
"These interest rate changes also have effects on asset prices, and thereby on household wealth, as well as on the exchange value of the dollar and, thereby, on net exports and core import prices.7 However, relative to balance sheet policies, the influence of the short-term rate is far better understood and extensively tested: There have been several decades and many business cycles over which to measure and analyze how the federal funds rate affects financial markets and real activity.",2017-03-01
"In contrast, experience using the balance sheet as an active tool has been very limited and largely confined to a highly unusual period around the Global Financial Crisis, when short-term interest rates were constrained by the zero lower bound.",2017-03-01
"In addition to directly affecting longer-term interest rates, changes to the balance sheet could serve to reinforce policy communication associated with the short-term rate.",2017-03-01
"Assuming that a subordination strategy is adopted, and the balance sheet is set to shrink passively and predictably once reinvestment ceases or is phased out, there is some uncertainty around the size of the balance sheet when it returns to normal, which the Committee has described as ""no larger than necessary for the efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy.""",2017-03-01
"Most obviously, trend growth in the demand for currency gradually pushes up the size of the balance sheet over time, but there are also other reasons to expect the post-crisis new normal to be larger than pre-crisis levels.",2017-03-01
"The structural demand for reserves may be considerably larger now than prior to the financial crisis because of a number of changes, including new regulations that favor safe liquid assets and changes in financial institutions' attitudes toward risk.9 If the demand curve for reserve balances has shifted out, then a greater supply of reserves will be needed to attain a given interest rate target.",2017-03-01
"Moreover, the supply of reserves will need to be set far enough above the structural level of demand to accommodate unexpected shocks to the demand and supply of reserves.",2017-03-01
"Or, the Committee could decide to maintain the current floor system, in which a buffer of reserves, sufficient to accommodate any sizable shocks to reserves demand and supply, is maintained, thereby obviating the need for high-frequency adjustments to the supply of reserves.",2017-03-01
"The Committee's normalization principles suggest that any buffer would be the minimum amount needed to efficiently and effectively implement policy.10 Because of changes in structural and short-term factors since the crisis, it is difficult to know with any precision how low reserves can be allowed to drop while still maintaining effective interest rate control.",2017-03-01
"At that point, the amount of reserves will likely be close to the minimum amount necessary to satisfy demand at the target rate.11 Conclusion To conclude, recent developments suggest that the macro economy may be at a transition.",2017-03-01
"With full employment within reach, signs of progress on our inflation mandate, and a favorable shift in the balance of risks at home and abroad, it will likely be appropriate for the Committee to continue gradually removing monetary accommodation.",2017-03-01
These transitions in the economy and monetary policy are positive reflections of the fact that the economy is gradually drawing closer to our policy goals.,2017-03-01
