"According to van Ark and Inklaar, some of the differential reflects faster capital deepening in the United States, but much of it reflects a surge in multifactor productivity growth in the United States outside of the IT sector since 2000.4 Innovations in information technology, however, cannot be the whole story--flexibility at the firm level and in labor markets, and competitive pressure throughout the economy, also play their roles.5 Businesses must be flexible enough to adopt new technologies and then to transform themselves in ways that allow technology-intensive investment to have the highest possible effect on productivity growth.",2006-09-27,DOVISH,0.5160391926765442

"A good deal of research, including the Boardâ€™s large-scale econometric model of the U.S. economy (FRB/US), suggests that what is called Sayâ€™s law still holds.7 That is, in the model, an increase in the level of productivity (reflecting, for example, some technological advance) causes businesses and financial markets to revise upward their views about the level of expected profits, and it causes households to revise upward their views about the level of permanent income.",2006-09-27,DOVISH,0.8180839419364929

"Second, underlying trend inflation appears to be somewhat below the Committee's 2 percent objective, according to various statistical filters.4 The near decade of inflation persistently short of 2 percent creates the risk that households and businesses come to expect inflation to run persistently below target and change their behavior in a way that fulfills that expectation, which greatly complicates the task of monetary policy.",2020-09-01,NEUTRAL,0.9906244874000549

"Finally, the sensitivity of price inflation to labor market tightness is very low relative to earlier decades, which is what economists mean when they say that the Phillips curve is flat.5 A flat Phillips curve has the important advantage of allowing employment to continue expanding for longer without generating inflationary pressures, thereby providing job opportunities to people that might not otherwise have them.",2020-09-01,NEUTRAL,0.5192281603813171

"Instead of an aggregate ""normal"" unemployment rate, the Committee's commitment to defining the maximum level of employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal, together with our continued commitment to consider a wide range of indicators, may be particularly significant for the groups that are most vulnerable to employment fluctuations.8 Both research and experience suggest the groups that face the greatest structural challenges in the labor market are likely to be the first to experience layoffs during downturns and the last to experience employment gains during recoveries.",2020-09-01,NEUTRAL,0.9390788078308105
"Research by the Federal Reserve Board staff finds that unemployment rates, as well as patterns of job loss and labor force entry and exit, are more cyclically sensitive for Blacks and Hispanics than for whites, and observable worker characteristics can explain very little of these differentials.9 A similar observation was one of the key takeaways from the Fed Listens sessions we held around the country.10 Juan Salgado, chancellor of the City Colleges of Chicago, described how last year's tight labor market was finally giving his students, who are largely Black and Latinx, the opportunity to apprentice with local businesses in jobs that historically have not been open to them.11 Moreover, earnings from wages are particularly important for these groups, who have large and persistent wealth gaps and derive a smaller share of their income from financial asset holdings or from business ownership.12 Second, to address the downward bias to inflation associated with the proximity to the effective lower bound, the statement adopts a flexible inflation averaging strategy that seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time in order to ensure longer-term inflation expectations are well anchored at 2 percent.",2020-09-01,HAWKISH,0.5654177665710449

Today I will discuss the acceleration of productivity that has occurred over the past decade and our current understanding of its causes.,2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.6469438672065735
In the discussion I will comment on two puzzles raised by this improved performance and then conclude by briefly addressing the longer-term prospects for productivity growth in the United States.,2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.8717339038848877
Productivity Resurgence and Its CausesWhat underlies the resurgence in U.S. productivity growth?,2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.62101149559021
Explanations of the rise in productivity growth since about 1995 have evolved somewhat over time.,2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.8495659828186035
"By 2000 or so, an emerging consensus held that the pickup in productivity growth was, for the most part, the product of both rapid technological progress and increased investment in new information and communication technologies (IT) during the 1990s (see Jorgenson and Stiroh, 2000, and Oliner and Sichel, 2000).",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.9647172093391418
"According to this view, developments in IT promoted U.S. productivity growth in two ways.",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.9087632298469543
"First, technological advances allowed the IT-producing sectors themselves to exhibit rapid productivity growth.",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.8477343916893005
Both the more-rapid pace of production and the higher average quality of output raised productivity at Intel as well as at competing firms that were forced to keep pace.,2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.6310730576515198
"Second, advances in information technology also promoted productivity growth outside the IT-producing sector, as firms in a wide range of industries expanded their investments in high-tech equipment and software and used the new technologies to reduce costs and increase quality.",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.9199777245521545
"Some large retailers, for example, developed IT-based tools to improve the management of their supply chains and to increase their responsiveness to changes in the level and mix of customer demands.",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.9465839266777039
Securities brokers and dealers achieved substantial productivity gains by automating their trading processes and their back-office operations.,2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.9011210799217224
"One study (Stiroh, 2002) found that a majority of U.S. industries experienced an acceleration of productivity in the latter part of the 1990s.",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.9199188947677612
"Undoubtedly, the IT revolution and the resurgence of productivity in the United States after 1995 were closely connected.",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.9492017030715942
"However, the technology-based explanation of increased productivity growth does raise a couple of puzzles (see, for example, McKinsey and Company, 2001 and 2005, and Basu and others, 2003).",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.8580073118209839
"Yet, with a few exceptions, the available data show that productivity growth in other advanced countries has not increased to the extent seen in the United States.",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.5556336641311646
"Second, as I have noted, productivity growth increased very rapidly earlier this decade and has continued to rise at a solid pace, even though IT investment declined sharply after the stock prices of high-tech firms plummeted in 2000.",2006-08-31,HAWKISH,0.7187005877494812
"More generally, as a historical matter, increases in IT investment have not always been followed in short order by increases in productivity growth.",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.8877300024032593
"This observation raises the question of why, in some cases, the putative productivity benefits of investments in new technologies do not occur until years after those investments are made.",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.836477518081665
In regard to the first puzzle--the fact that the United States has enjoyed greater productivity growth in recent years than other advanced countries--the comparison with Europe is particularly interesting.,2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.761185348033905
"Throughout most of the post-World War II period, productivity growth in Europe exceeded that in the United States, at first because of the rapid gains during the postwar reconstruction and then later because of a gradual convergence of European technology and business practices to American standards.",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.9501879811286926
"By one estimate, European productivity increased from 44 percent of the U.S. level in 1950 to near-equality with the United States by 1995 (Gordon, 2004 and 2006).",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.9428726434707642
"However, the available data suggest that, since about 1995, productivity growth in European nations has slowed, on average, in contrast to the pickup experienced in the United States.",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.4847223460674286
"These trends have led to an increasing divergence in productivity levels in the United States and Europe (see van Ark and Inklaar, 2005).",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.7918493151664734
"Researchers have made the important point that differences in productivity growth between the United States and Europe appear not to have been particularly large in the IT-producing sectors, where U.S. strengths in the development of computers and semiconductors have been partly offset by European leadership in communications.",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.9548763632774353
Differences in economic policies and systems likely have accounted for some of the differences in the performance of productivity.,2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.9470321536064148
"One leading explanation for the strong U.S. productivity growth is that labor markets in the United States tend to be more flexible and competitive, market characteristics that have allowed the United States to realize greater economic benefits from new technologies.",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.9265178442001343
"For example, some economists have argued that restrictions on land use and on shopping hours in Europe have impeded the development of ""big box"" retail outlets, reducing competition and denying European firms the economies of scale that have been important for productivity growth in the retail sector in the United States (Gordon, 2004).",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.9793939590454102
"Also, although it is not a feature unique to the United States, the increasing degree of openness of our economy to trade and foreign investment and the consequent exposure of U.S. companies to the rigors of international as well as domestic competition, may have promoted productivity growth.2 As a leading example, productivity gains in U.S. manufacturing--which is particularly subject to international competition--have been especially impressive in recent years, averaging, by one measure, about 6 percent per year over the past decade.3 A number of other explanations have been advanced for the relatively stronger performance of productivity in the United States in recent years, including international differences in management practices, the depth and sophistication of U.S. capital markets, more favorable attitudes toward competition and entrepreneurship in the United States, and the role of U.S. research universities in fostering innovation.4 Further study of national productivity differentials clearly is warranted.",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.9000706672668457
"The second productivity puzzle relates to the further acceleration in productivity that occurred earlier in this decade despite the decline in IT investment after 2000 and the rather modest recovery in recent years.5 Again, a number of explanations have been proposed, including business restructuring and an even more rapid pace of technical change and of the diffusion of technological advances.",2006-08-31,NEUTRAL,0.4096834659576416
"It is interesting, however, that the recent episode is not the first time that we have seen productivity improvements lagging well behind investments in new technology.",2006-08-31,NEUTRAL,0.501246988773346
"Notably, computers were first commercialized in the 1950s, and personal computers began to come into widespread use in the early 1980s; but until the mid-1990s, these developments had little evident effect on measures of productivity.",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.9665221571922302
"Indeed, an oft-quoted quip by economist Robert Solow held that, as of the late 1980s, ""computers are everywhere except in the productivity statistics.""",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.9357414841651917
"In attempting to explain the tendency of productivity growth to lag behind investments in new technologies, economists have emphasized that much more than the purchase of new high-tech equipment is needed to achieve significant gains in productivity.",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.8923519253730774
"Case studies of individual industries show that the planning for technological modernization has not always been adequate, with the result that some purchases of high-tech equipment and software have not added much to productivity or profits.",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.9724556803703308
"Second, firmsâ€™ need to invest in intangible capital--and thus to divert resources from the production of market goods or services--helps to explain why measured output and productivity may decline or grow slowly during the period after firms adopt new technologies.",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.9344002604484558
"Finally, the concept of intangible capital may shed light on the puzzle of why productivity growth has remained strong despite the deceleration in IT investment.",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.7986701130867004
"Because investments in high-tech capital typically require complementary investments in intangible capital for productivity gains to be realized, the benefits of high-tech investment may become visible only after an extended period during which firms are making the necessary investments in intangibles.",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.9113254547119141
"Longer-Term Prospects for Productivity GrowthHistorical analyses of the sources of fluctuations in productivity growth are challenging, but not nearly so challenging as trying to predict how productivity will evolve in the future.",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.9628695249557495
"However, because the rate of productivity growth is a primary determinant of economic performance, policymakers have few options other than to try to forecast future gains in productivity.",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.9673535227775574
"For example, estimates of long-term productivity growth are needed to determine the rate of output growth that the economy can sustain in the long run without generating inflationary pressures.",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.9021966457366943
"The task of trying to predict the behavior of productivity in the medium-to-long run is complicated by the fact that productivity growth generally varies with the business cycle, tending to be below its longer-term trend when the economy is contracting and above that trend when the economy is in the early stages of an expansion (see Basu and Fernald, 2001, for a discussion).",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.9693218469619751
"(This well-documented pattern makes the strong growth of productivity during the early part of this decade, a period that featured a recession and generally slow growth, all the more remarkable.)",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.6727982759475708
Economists use statistical methods to try to abstract from cyclical influences to determine the longer-term trend in productivity.,2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.9149433970451355
"As of a couple of years ago, the consensus among leading researchers was that productivity in the nonfarm business sector was likely to grow at about 2-1/2 percent per year in the longer term, close to the rate of productivity growth achieved during the 1995 to 2000 period (see, for example, Baily, 2003; Gordon, 2003; and Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh, 2004).",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.7502555251121521
"On the one hand, recent data revisions to the national income and product accounts have shown that productivity growth over the past few years was slightly weaker than we thought, leading some analysts to revise down their estimates of trend productivity growth about 1/4 percentage point or so per year.",2006-08-31,NEUTRAL,0.9350757002830505
"On the other hand, the fact that productivity growth has remained solid in recent years increases confidence that a larger fraction of those productivity gains reflects longer-term developments and a smaller fraction reflects cyclical factors.",2006-08-31,HAWKISH,0.5066141486167908
"On net, the recent experience does not appear to require a significant rethinking of long-term productivity trends.",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.9548206925392151
"Indeed, recent estimates by leading economists continue to peg the expected longer-term rate of productivity growth at roughly 2-1/2 percent per year.7 Of course, as the saying goes, past returns do not guarantee future results, and not all the evidence supports this optimistic view of productivity trends.",2006-08-31,NEUTRAL,0.7350512146949768
"For example, although spending on high-tech equipment and software has recovered noticeably from its recent lows, growth in IT spending remains well below the rates observed before the 2001 recession.",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.8580823540687561
"Some industry participants have suggested that less-rapid growth in IT spending may reflect the absence of major new business applications for IT--""killer apps,"" as they are called.",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.8477493524551392
"Moreover, until we have a more complete understanding of the factors behind productivity growth in the past five years, we should be cautious in drawing any strong conclusions about the future.",2006-08-31,DOVISH,0.9322608709335327

"In this case, which is relevant today in the United States and some other countries, the exposure to interest rate and inflation volatility embedded in a long-maturity bond is more than offset by the potential value of the bond in hedging other risks, such as equity risk.2 The expectation of the average level of future short-term interest rates can, in turn, be decomposed into the expectation of average future real interest rates and the expectation of average future inflation rates.",2019-11-12,DOVISH,0.9810834527015686

"Policymakers and academics alike, including myself, have spent considerable time exploring the reasons for and ramifications of the decline in r* across countries.3 For example, many have pointed to slowing population growth and a moderation in the pace of technological change as consistent with a lower level of r*.4 Changes in risk tolerance and regulations have led to an increase in savings and in the demand for safe assets, pushing down yields on sovereign bonds.5 Importantly, economic theory suggests and empirical research confirms that there is a significant common global component embedded in individual country r*s (figure 3, ""Estimates of r*"").6 This common factor driving individual country r*s not only reflects the influence of common global shocks affecting all economies in a similar way (for example, a slowdown in global productivity and the demographics associated with aging), but also results from international capital flows that respond to and, over time, tend to narrow divergences in rates of return offered across different countries.",2019-11-12,NEUTRAL,0.9294281005859375

"Unlike the decline in r*, which primarily reflects fundamental ""real"" factors that are outside the control of a central bank, the decline and ultimate anchoring of inflation and inflation expectations in both major and many emerging economies were the direct consequence of the widespread adoption and commitment to transparent, flexible inflation-targeting monetary policy strategies.",2019-11-12,HAWKISH,0.9788834452629089

"For example, in a textbook DSGE (dynamic stochastic general equilibrium) model (Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (CGG), 1999) featuring a central bank that implements policy via a Taylor-type rule, the equilibrium variance of inflation will be lower the more aggressively the central bank leans against exogenous shocks that push inflation away from target.",2019-11-12,HAWKISH,0.9446501731872559
"So even if the variance of inflation shocks is constant, the variance of inflation itself will be an endogenous function of monetary policy.",2019-11-12,DOVISH,0.9525943994522095
Another related channel through which monetary policy can influence the variance of inflation is by changing the equilibrium persistence of inflation deviations from target.,2019-11-12,DOVISH,0.9753315448760986
"In the textbook CGG model (1999), augmented with a hybrid Phillips curve that features an inertial backward-looking component, the equilibrium persistence of inflation is an endogenous function of the monetary policy rule such that the more aggressively the central bank leans against exogenous shocks that push inflation away from target, the less persistent are inflation deviations from target in equilibrium.",2019-11-12,DOVISH,0.7498288154602051

"Decomposing the factors that drive equilibrium term premiums is an active area of academic research, and I will not attempt to summarize or synthesize this vast literature.8 But I would like to emphasize what seems to me to be three contributors to the decline in the term premium in the United States and perhaps in other countries as well.9 First, the decline in inflation volatility has almost certainly been important in driving the term premium on nominal bonds lower.",2019-11-12,DOVISH,0.6270661950111389

"Through this channel, the decline in inflation volatility should be reflected in a smaller inflation risk premium in nominal bond yields, which is exactly what is estimated in the Kim, Walsh, and Wei (2019) yield curve model (figure 4, ""Term Premium Decomposition"").",2019-11-12,HAWKISH,0.9206748008728027

"Using the neoclassical model, and disaggregating capital into information and communications technology and other capital, Dan Sichel and Steve Oliner of the Board staff decomposed productivity growth into contributions from capital deepening (the growth arising from an increase in the ratio of capital to labor) and multifactor productivity growth (the growth in output that cannot be accounted for by increases in labor and capital inputs) and into the contributions from the use of information technology and from increased efficiency in the production of computers.",2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.9185038208961487

So let me count the ways that supply and demand help us to understand the recent experience and the challenges facing monetary policy today.,2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.9649035334587097
"First, a productivity shock affects aggregate demand as well as potential supply and may initially have an even larger effect on demand than on supply.",2000-06-06,NEUTRAL,0.8039681315422058
"In early discussions about the productivity shock, the emphasis was, not surprisingly, exclusively on its supply-side implications--specifically a faster rate of productivity growth and hence of sustainable GDP growth.",2000-06-06,NEUTRAL,0.8112933039665222
The natural corollary seemed to be that a faster growth of supply than of demand would be a powerful disinflationary force.,2000-06-06,NEUTRAL,0.7148289084434509
"But during the period over which productivity has accelerated, demand has grown faster than potential supply.",2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.964478075504303
"The demand effects--to the extent that they are directly related to the productivity shock--likely reflect the more favorable investment opportunities, the effect of expected profitability on equity prices and hence household wealth and consumption, and the effect of the increase in expected future labor income on current consumption.",2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.4139062464237213
"Demand, it appears, received an additional boost over this period from a run-up in equity prices that the higher productivity growth alone could not fully account for.",2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.718275785446167
"The balance between supply and demand can be inferred from movements in utilization rates, specifically in the unemployment rate.",2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.980703592300415
"When actual output is expanding at the same pace as potential, the unemployment rate will be stable.",2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.6467078328132629
"When output growth outpaces the growth of potential, the unemployment rate declines.",2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.42354702949523926
And the unemployment rate has declined almost 0.4 percentage points a year for the past four years.,2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.6469479203224182
This translates into excess demand growth of 0.75 to 1 percentage point relative to potential supply growth.,2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.9575743675231934
The second insight--and enduring old economy wisdom--is that a proximate source of changes in inflation is an imbalance between the levels of aggregate supply and aggregate demand.,2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.896997332572937
This can be expressed as an imbalance between actual and potential output or as a divergence of the unemployment rate from the NAIRU.,2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.674045205116272
"The imbalance between the growth rates of aggregate supply and demand is, of course, the source of changes in the balance between the levels of aggregate demand and supply.",2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.984691321849823
But inflation is related directly to the levels not to the growth imbalance.,2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.7576566934585571
"And, even in the new economy, excess aggregate demand ultimately drives up inflation.",2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.9214602112770081
Do we have excess aggregate demand?,2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.5842286944389343

"This uncertainty has been, in my view, an important consideration in the way monetary policy has responded to recent economic developments.",2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.9636572003364563

But why has inflation remained moderate if there is persistent excess demand in the labor market?,2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.6679303646087646
This is still another supply and demand story.,2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.8318660259246826
The economy is subject to two fundamental types of aggregate economic shocks: supply shocks and demand shocks.,2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.9591730237007141
These two types of shocks give rise to different challenges for monetary policy.,2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.919041097164154
Supply shocks come in two varieties: relative price shocks (such as changes in the relative price of oil) and productivity shocks.,2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.9594392776489258

The disinflationary effect of an increase in productivity growth begins to dissipate once productivity growth stabilizes at a higher level.,2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.5019494295120239
"So unless productivity accelerates further, its disinflationary effect should continue to erode for a time.",2000-06-06,NEUTRAL,0.9702267646789551
"When favorable supply shocks dominate, growth in demand is stimulated and utilization rates rise, but inflation tends to moderate.",2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.8500003814697266
"The result is offsetting implications for the setting of the nominal funds rate and, thus, monetary policy may be left with little work to do.",2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.7377398610115051

"Of course, overall inflation has clearly increased significantly over the last year.",2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.9528587460517883
"The consumer price index, for example, has increased at a 3 percent rate over the last twelve months, compared with a 2.3 percent rate over the previous twelve months.",2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.9586978554725647
Similar trends are evident in the PCE and in the GDP price index.,2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.7788240313529968
But this increase in overall inflation reflects mainly the rise in oil prices over 1999 and into 2000.,2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.9708783030509949
"Assuming that oil prices stabilize, the effect will dissipate, and overall inflation will return toward, and indeed dip slightly below, the core rate (the rate net of food and energy prices).",2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.8938478231430054
"So, looking forward, the core inflation rate is the more important consideration.",2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.6838114857673645
These numbers suggest that inflation pressures remain well contained.,2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.9190234541893005
"But digging a little deeper, the evidence, in my judgment, supports the conclusion that core inflation has moved modestly higher over the last six to nine months.",2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.9588475227355957
"First, the introduction of a methodological change in measuring the CPI in January 1999 lowered CPI inflation relative to the earlier period.",2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.5187944769859314
"As a result, on a methodologically consistent basis, core CPI inflation in the last twelve months has actually been up a couple tenths of a percentage point.",2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.9812637567520142
"But, more important, the higher-frequency data provides some evidence of a rising trend in core inflation.",2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.9520443081855774
"For example, at an annual rate, core CPI inflation is 2.4 percent over the last nine months, 2.5 percent over the last six months and 3.2 percent over the last three months.",2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.8848835825920105
So I conclude that the underlying trend for core CPI inflation has moved up to close to 2-1/2 percent today.,2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.9558387398719788
The core PCE and the GDP price indexes also have accelerated over the last six to nine months.,2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.936896026134491
The higher core inflation could be explained by a pass-through to the core of earlier increases in oil prices.,2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.9620580077171326
"However, whether such a pass-through leads to a one-time increase in the price level or to continuing inflation depends on whether or not monetary policy accommodates the higher inflation.",2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.9602664113044739
"Whether such accommodation occurs, in turn, depends on how policy deals with the excess demand that will be felt in the first instance in wage pressures in a very tight labor market.",2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.9597350358963013
"For example, consider the trend in year-over-year growth rates for the three key measures.",2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.91597580909729
"For the employment cost index, the trend is decidedly up; for average hourly earnings, however, the year-over- year growth rate has been flat; and for compensation per hour in the productivity and costs report, the trend is actually down.",2000-06-06,NEUTRAL,0.4743095338344574
"Until the May employment report, the recent monthly data clearly pointed to an acceleration in average hourly earnings--given the 4-1/2 percent rate posted over the first four months of the year after a 3-1/2 percent rate over 1999.",2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.8553158044815063
"There are, in my judgment, some grounds for discounting the productivity and cost measure.",2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.7614878416061401
"Even if the evidence for an acceleration in nominal labor compensation were more definitive, the implications for inflation are not altogether straightforward.",2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.5294389724731445
"If the trend in the growth of labor compensation is upward, it could be a response to the uptick in overall inflation last year or to overly tight labor markets or to a catch-up to the higher rate of productivity growth.",2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.987152636051178
"Just as the slowing in overall inflation in 1997 and 1998 contributed to a moderation in nominal wage demands, the higher overall inflation in 1999 and 2000 would be expected to boost nominal wage demands.",2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.9267482161521912
But any rebound in nominal labor compensation could also reflect a catch-up to higher productivity growth.,2000-06-06,NEUTRAL,0.5651299357414246
"If nominal compensation is just matching the higher productivity growth, this source of acceleration in nominal compensation would not itself be inflationary.",2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.8080840110778809
The slow initial response of nominal compensation to higher productivity growth is the source of the temporary disinflationary effect of a productivity shock.,2000-06-06,NEUTRAL,0.9815555214881897
"Therefore, once the catch-up is under way, this disinflationary impetus gradually disappears.",2000-06-06,NEUTRAL,0.6189056038856506
"And at this point, the pass-through from higher inflation and the effect of tight labor markets have no offset and will begin to dominate.",2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.991166889667511
So even the catch-up story plays a role in the upward trend in inflation.,2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.9736356139183044
A second reason that nominal compensation is so difficult to factor into an inflation forecast is that compensation practices are changing.,2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.930202066898346
"Stock options are incorporated, based on gains upon exercising the options, in the productivity and cost measure, but not in the ECI.",2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.9277971386909485
"So what is the outlook for inflation, and how does it relate to the interplay of new economy forces and traditional supply and demand considerations?",2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.9381994009017944
"In my judgment, we took the benefits of both the earlier favorable relative price shocks and the productivity shock, partly in a decline in the unemployment rate below the NAIRU and partly in a decline in inflation.",2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.9759002327919006
"This is not a statement about what policymakers planned, but rather about what evolved as we responded to unexpected developments in inflation and growth.",2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.9423725008964539
"At any rate, we could have taken more of the benefits of the favorable supply shocks in lower inflation, but given that inflation was already so low, the combination we ended up with seems, after the fact, to have been reasonable.",2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.557327389717102
"At some point, however, when the temporary disinflationary impetus of the favorable supply developments dissipate, not only will there be some rebound in inflation, but unless a transition is made back to sustainable utilization rates, there will be a risk of a continuous upward movement in inflation.",2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.9888713955879211
"During that transition, at least some of the earlier decline in core inflation will be reversed.",2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.9477859735488892
"To be sure, it has been difficult to be precise about both sustainable utilization rates and the path of inflation because of uncertainties about the NAIRU and other aspects of inflation dynamics in a period of significant structural change.",2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.964387059211731
"Given our uncertainty about sustainable utilization rates and wage-price dynamics in the new economy, however, policy setting must remain flexible and responsive to new information about both the supply and the demand sides of our economy.",2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.9531493186950684
Conclusion: The Challenge Facing Monetary Policy This analysis suggests that monetary policy does face a challenge--rebalancing aggregate supply and demand to contain the risk of higher inflation.,2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.9855136275291443
The major question in this respect is whether slowing the economy to trend alone will get the job done or whether we need a period of below-trend growth to unwind an imbalance between the levels of aggregate demand and supply.,2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.778863251209259
"If the task is only slowing the economy to trend--because the NAIRU turns out to be close to 4 percent--the task is not as challenging, and inflation will remain stable near current levels.",2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.4621262550354004
"If the NAIRU turns out to be closer to 5 percent, then the task is more demanding, and growth will have to slow to below trend for a while, and inflation is likely to rise somewhat further until the rebalancing is complete.",2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.9599136710166931
"If successful, in either scenario, the payoff from monetary restraint will be both to contain the risk of higher inflation and to extend the life of this remarkable expansion.",2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.9796638488769531
"First, we are now in a high-growth rather than a low-growth economy.",2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.750474214553833
"Even if we have to slow growth to below trend for a period, the resulting growth rate could remain well above the average growth rate over the previous 25 years and still get the job done.",2000-06-06,NEUTRAL,0.6714259386062622
"If oil prices have now at least peaked--and, better yet, if they decline at least modestly over the next year and a half, as suggested by expectations reflected in futures markets--the upward impetus to overall inflation from oil prices will dissipate or even reverse.",2000-06-06,DOVISH,0.7296079993247986
"In this case, overall inflation is likely to decline next year, and this decrease could help moderate the rise in core inflation into the following year.",2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.8960059881210327
"Third, long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored, reflecting considerable confidence that monetary policy will contain any threat of higher inflation.",2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.7870500683784485
This should damp the rise in inflation in the short term.,2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.9400038123130798
"Fourth, monetary policy got a head start on containing inflation by beginning to tighten last June, before the signs of building inflation pressures were evident.",2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.987817108631134
"Fifth, the tighter monetary policy is now contributing to a less accommodative set of financial conditions throughout the economy--including higher short- and long-term private interest rates, lower equity prices, a stronger dollar, and more stringent lending conditions at banks.",2000-06-06,HAWKISH,0.9609861969947815

"September 27, 2007 Globalization, Macroeconomic Performance, and Monetary Policy Governor Frederic S. Mishkin At the Domestic Prices in an Integrated World Economy Conference, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C. Share In recent years, globalization has become one of the hottest topics, not only for the general public but also for central bankers.1 Some commentators have gone so far as to claim that greater openness of economies to flows of goods, services, capital, and businesses from other nations invalidate traditional economic models of inflation, which take little account of globalization.",2007-09-27,DOVISH,0.9662731885910034
"In the long run, monetary policy strives to achieve price stability, which contributes to maximum sustainable employment and economic growth.",2007-09-27,HAWKISH,0.900162398815155
"In the shorter run, we at the Federal Reserve aim to achieve our dual mandate of not only stabilizing prices but also reducing the volatility of output and employment around their maximum sustainable levels.",2007-09-27,HAWKISH,0.9591155648231506
"Globalization affects the ability of monetary policy makers to stabilize prices and output in two ways: (1) through its effects on the behavior of inflation and output and (2) through its effects on the ways in which monetary policy influences inflation and output--that is, on the monetary transmission mechanism.",2007-09-27,DOVISH,0.9715756177902222
I will look at each in turn and will then use the analysis to address another important issue for monetary policy makers: Has globalization been a key driver of improvements in inflation performance and the decline in inflation that we have been seeing throughout the world?,2007-09-27,DOVISH,0.8373245596885681
"Globalization and Inflation We should never forget Milton Friedman's adage that ""inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.""",2007-09-27,DOVISH,0.8457181453704834
"In the long run, as long as a central bank has an independent monetary policyâ€‘â€‘that is, it is not locked into a fixed-exchange-rate regime in which its hands are tiedâ€‘â€‘the rate of inflation is determined by monetary policy.",2007-09-27,DOVISH,0.9367489218711853
"Globalization, however, can have an effect on the incentives for central banks to control inflation and, more directly, on inflation developments in the short and medium runs.",2007-09-27,DOVISH,0.9682793617248535
"Kenneth Rogoff (2003) argues that globalization has led to greater price flexibility, which has reduced the ability of central banks to use inflation surprises to boost output.",2007-09-27,DOVISH,0.9117054343223572
"In other words, the Phillips curve will steepen, making more stark the short-run tradeoff between unemployment and inflation.",2007-09-27,HAWKISH,0.8912568092346191
"As a result, central banks will be less tempted to try to exploit the short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, as in the Barro-Gordon (1983) model, and so will be less likely to pursue overly expansionary monetary policy that leads to higher inflation.",2007-09-27,HAWKISH,0.8057644367218018
"A major problem with Rogoff's argument is that instead of steepening with the growth of globalization in recent years, the Phillips curve has become flatter, not only in the United States but also in many other countries throughout the world (Borio and Filardo, 2007; International Monetary Fund, 2006; Ihrig and others, 2007; Pain, Koske, and Sollie, 2006).",2007-09-27,DOVISH,0.5979205965995789
"Globalization, because it makes markets more competitive, also has the potential to spur productivity growth.",2007-09-27,DOVISH,0.7524293661117554
Higher productivity growth can lead to a reduction in inflation because it directly lowers prices if monetary policy does not become more expansionary.,2007-09-27,HAWKISH,0.9655214548110962
"In addition, such growth makes it easier for the monetary authorities to allow inflation to fall because output growth will continue to be rapid when inflation is declining.",2007-09-27,HAWKISH,0.8237249255180359
"This may have been the situation in the United States in the late 1990s, when productivity growth surged and inflation declined.",2007-09-27,DOVISH,0.9361546039581299
"The rise in productivity growth during this period in the United States, however, did not seem to spill over to other industrial countries, a result that cast doubt on whether globalization has indeed accelerated the transmission of productivity growth across national borders.",2007-09-27,DOVISH,0.8543898463249207
"Because globalization increases competition, it can also reduce markups (price over costs), and this reduction may lead to lower relative prices, as is argued by Chen, Imbs, and Scott (2007).",2007-09-27,HAWKISH,0.5276650190353394
"However, lower markups and price levels should have only transitory effects on inflation.",2007-09-27,HAWKISH,0.9405493140220642
"These effects from the greater price flexibility and increased competition in domestic markets that have arisen from globalization, while theoretically plausible, are often at variance with salient features of the world economy, and so they do not explain why inflation has declined in recent years.",2007-09-27,DOVISH,0.8728426694869995
"If China were truly exporting deflation, the effect should be evident primarily in the behavior of import prices.",2007-09-27,NEUTRAL,0.5570680499076843
"Research at the Federal Reserve Board by Kamin, Marazzi, and Schindler (2006) estimates that purchases of manufactures from China have lowered U.S. import price inflation roughly 1 percentage point annually over the past decade, a decline that has led to a short-run lowering of consumer price inflation of about one-tenth of 1 percentage point and a somewhat larger effect over the longer term.",2007-09-27,NEUTRAL,0.6765450835227966
"Research at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) by Pain, Koske, and Sollie (2006) arrives at a similar estimate of the effect of trade in manufactures with developing countries on U.S. inflation: negative 0.2 to negative 0.3 percentage point.",2007-09-27,DOVISH,0.8583271503448486
"At the same time, the additional demand for primary commodities by developing Asia, especially China and India, is putting upward pressure on global prices of these goods.",2007-09-27,HAWKISH,0.9891195297241211

"The global commodities boom, which has been stimulated by the emergence of the Chinese and Indian economies on the international scene, has been an important offset to the deflationary effects from their low-priced goods and services.",2007-09-27,HAWKISH,0.5463975071907043
"Analysis by the Board's staff, which weights the negative effect on U.S. inflation from cheaper manufactures against the positive effect from higher commodity prices, finds that the net effect in recent years could go either way but in any case is probably quite small.",2007-09-27,DOVISH,0.9054732918739319
"Looking back before the recent boom in commodities prices, the staff's best estimate is that China's and India's entrance on the global trading scene has had a small negative effect on inflation.",2007-09-27,DOVISH,0.7045580744743347
"Laurence Ball (2006) makes an important point that cheaper imports from places like China lower relative prices for imported goods but ultimately do not affect inflation, which is the change in overall prices.",2007-09-27,DOVISH,0.9209504723548889
"Following the argument made by Milton Friedman (Friedman, 1974), Ball points out that for every decline in the relative price of one good or service in a price index like the consumer price index (CPI), there is by definition a rise in the relative price of some other good or service.",2007-09-27,HAWKISH,0.5134373307228088
Any pattern of relative-price changes is compatible with a particular level of the inflation rate.,2007-09-27,DOVISH,0.9130694270133972
"What determines the overall inflation rate is not relative prices for one category of goods and services but rather the balance between overall demand and supply in the economy, which ultimately is influenced by monetary policy.",2007-09-27,DOVISH,0.9077442288398743
Ball therefore takes the view that cheap imports from China and other low-wage economies should not affect inflation.,2007-09-27,DOVISH,0.6254023909568787
I would not go as far as Ball does for the reason that changes in relative prices in an important category of goods and services could affect inflation for a considerable period of time.,2007-09-27,DOVISH,0.9470526576042175
"Nevertheless, his argument, as well as the research cited earlier, indicates that many of the exaggerated claims that globalization has been an important factor in lowering inflation in recent years just do not hold up.",2007-09-27,DOVISH,0.5144469141960144
It is thus of concern to monetary policy makers because it can affect both output volatility and our forecasts of the economy.,2007-09-27,DOVISH,0.9482898712158203
"Research at the Federal Reserve Board (Ihrig and others, 2007) documents that net exports tend to be negatively correlated with domestic demand and thus stabilize output; other research (Guerrieri, Gust, and López-Salido, 2007) finds that shocks to domestic demand move output less in more open economies.",2007-09-27,DOVISH,0.9267139434814453
"That said, as I have emphasized in my speeches and writings (Mishkin, 2006a, b; Mishkin, 2007b), I strongly believe that globalization is and has been a key factor in promoting economic growth.",2007-09-27,DOVISH,0.7512337565422058
"Globalization and the Monetary Transmission Mechanism Four questions naturally arise when we consider whether globalization has changed the monetary transmission mechanism, that is, how monetary policy influences inflation and output: (1) Has globalization led to a decline in the sensitivity of inflation to domestic output gaps (the difference between actual and potential output) and thus to domestic monetary policy?",2007-09-27,DOVISH,0.9858853816986084
"(2) Are foreign output gaps playing a more prominent role in the domestic inflation process, so that domestic monetary policy has more difficulty stabilizing inflation?",2007-09-27,HAWKISH,0.8910595178604126
(3) Can domestic monetary policy still control domestic interest rates and so stabilize both inflation and output?,2007-09-27,DOVISH,0.9397352933883667
"(4) Are there other ways, besides possible influences on inflation and interest rates, in which globalization may have affected the transmission mechanism of monetary policy?",2007-09-27,DOVISH,0.9434921741485596
Has globalization led to a decline in the sensitivity of inflation to domestic output gaps (the difference between actual and potential output) and thus to domestic monetary policy?,2007-09-27,DOVISH,0.9076589941978455
"In recent years, we have clearly witnessed a decline in the sensitivity of inflation to the domestic output gap (a flattening of the Phillips curve) in the United States and other advanced countries (Borio and Filardo, 2007; International Monetary Fund, 2006; Ihrig and others, 2007; Pain, Koske, and Sollie, 2006).",2007-09-27,DOVISH,0.8483579158782959

"Although this story is a plausible one, research at the Federal Reserve Board and elsewhere finds no evidence that the flattening of the Phillips curve reflects the process of increasing trade integration (Ihrig and others, 2007; Ball, 2006; Wynne and Kersting, 2007).2 Rather than globalization being an important factor leading to flatter Phillips curves, I would argue (as in Mishkin, 2007a) that flatter Phillips curves are the direct result of better monetary policy that has anchored inflation expectations.",2007-09-27,DOVISH,0.6382182240486145
"Because monetary authorities are focusing more on establishing a stronger nominal anchor, a rise in resource utilization will not lead to a rise in expected inflation.",2007-09-27,HAWKISH,0.49404793977737427

"Still, the sharper-than-expected decline in oil prices, the decline in long-term bond yields and the further rise in equity prices in recent months are providing some offset to the external drag coming from Asia and the appreciation of the dollar.",1998-04-09,NEUTRAL,0.9120234847068787
"The question is when and how much of a slowing results, and whether the slowdown takes growth to or below trend, or leaves growth still above trend.",1998-04-09,NEUTRAL,0.7320308089256287
"Second, there is a tug of war between the very tight labor market and the set of forces that have been restraining inflation.",1998-04-09,HAWKISH,0.5897338390350342
"The forces restraining inflation have been winning this battle to date, and they have been reinforced this year by the sharper-than-expected decline in oil prices, by the even more extraordinary decline in computer prices in recent months, and by the decline in commodity prices and further downward pressure on import prices associated with the crisis in Asia.",1998-04-09,NEUTRAL,0.9422592520713806
"As the economy entered 1998, continued momentum in private domestic demand was clearly evident, while the drag from Asia was less obvious.",1998-04-09,DOVISH,0.6183170080184937
"The March employment report was the strongest evidence to date that a slowing is under way, although it should be appreciated that there is often more noise than signal in one month's data.",1998-04-09,HAWKISH,0.6256492733955383
"In terms of inflation, there is no evidence to date that wage pressures are building, relative to last year, and certainly no evidence of a pickup in inflation, though the recent data for core CPI has hinted that the earlier downward trend may now be behind us.",1998-04-09,DOVISH,0.8595172166824341
"At any rate, it appears likely, given the renewal of favorable supply shocks, that inflation will remain well contained this year.",1998-04-09,HAWKISH,0.6679006218910217
But monetary policy has little ability to affect inflation this year.,1998-04-09,DOVISH,0.9493407011032104

The expected persistence of the special forces restraining inflation is therefore an important consideration in forecasting inflation and in assessing the appropriate course of monetary policy.,1998-04-09,DOVISH,0.8662691116333008

"For the past year and a half, my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) have been conducting the first-ever public review of our monetary policy framework.1 Earlier today we released a revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, a document that lays out our goals, articulates our framework for monetary policy, and serves as the foundation for our policy actions.2 Today I will discuss our review, the changes in the economy that motivated us to undertake it, and our revised statement, which encapsulates the main conclusions of the review.",2020-08-27,DOVISH,0.8792450428009033

"Before the Great Moderation, expansions typically ended in overheating and rising inflation.",2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.6943569183349609
"Since then, prior to the current pandemic-induced downturn, a series of historically long expansions had been more likely to end with episodes of financial instability, prompting essential efforts to substantially increase the strength and resilience of the financial system.4 By the early 2000s, many central banks around the world had adopted a monetary policy framework known as inflation targeting.5 Although the precise features of inflation targeting differed from country to country, the core framework always articulated an inflation goal as a primary objective of monetary policy.",2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.976341724395752
Inflation targeting was also associated with increased communication and transparency designed to clarify the central bank's policy intentions.,2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.8811890482902527
"Inflation-targeting central banks generally do not focus solely on inflation: Those with ""flexible"" inflation targets take into account economic stabilization in addition to their inflation objective.",2020-08-27,DOVISH,0.9217107892036438
"Under Ben Bernanke's leadership, the Federal Reserve adopted many of the features associated with flexible inflation targeting.6 We made great advances in transparency and communications, with the initiation of quarterly press conferences and the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which comprises the individual economic forecasts of FOMC participants.",2020-08-27,DOVISH,0.7837117910385132

"A central part of this statement was the articulation of a longer-run inflation goal of 2 percent.7 Because the structure of the labor market is strongly influenced by nonmonetary factors that can change over time, the Committee did not set a numerical objective for maximum employment.",2020-08-27,DOVISH,0.8488662242889404
"The 2012 statement was a significant milestone, reflecting lessons learned from fighting high inflation as well as from experience around the world with flexible inflation targeting.",2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.7937449812889099
"Since then, our understanding of the economy has evolved in ways that are central to monetary policy.",2020-08-27,DOVISH,0.9529210925102234
"Of course, the conduct of monetary policy has also evolved.",2020-08-27,DOVISH,0.9026212692260742
A key purpose of our review has been to take stock of the lessons learned over this period and identify any further changes in our monetary policy framework that could enhance our ability to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability objectives in the years ahead.9 Our evolving understanding of four key economic developments motivated our review.,2020-08-27,DOVISH,0.9488600492477417
"First, assessments of the potential, or longer-run, growth rate of the economy have declined.",2020-08-27,NEUTRAL,0.8687671422958374
"For example, since January 2012, the median estimate of potential growth from FOMC participants has fallen from 2.5 percent to 1.8 percent (see figure 1).",2020-08-27,NEUTRAL,0.902709424495697
"Some slowing in growth relative to earlier decades was to be expected, reflecting slowing population growth and the aging of the population.",2020-08-27,DOVISH,0.47287070751190186
"More troubling has been the decline in productivity growth, which is the primary driver of improving living standards over time.10 Second, the general level of interest rates has fallen both here in the United States and around the world.",2020-08-27,NEUTRAL,0.9184397459030151
"Estimates of the neutral federal funds rate, which is the rate consistent with the economy operating at full strength and with stable inflation, have fallen substantially, in large part reflecting a fall in the equilibrium real interest rate, or ""r-star.""",2020-08-27,NEUTRAL,0.969343900680542
"This rate is not affected by monetary policy but instead is driven by fundamental factors in the economy, including demographics and productivity growthâ€”the same factors that drive potential economic growth.11 The median estimate from FOMC participants of the neutral federal funds rate has fallen by nearly half since early 2012, from 4.25 percent to 2.5 percent (see figure 2).",2020-08-27,DOVISH,0.47907575964927673
This decline in assessments of the neutral federal funds rate has profound implications for monetary policy.,2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.8282395601272583
"With interest rates generally running closer to their effective lower bound even in good times, the Fed has less scope to support the economy during an economic downturn by simply cutting the federal funds rate.12 The result can be worse economic outcomes in terms of both employment and price stability, with the costs of such outcomes likely falling hardest on those least able to bear them.",2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.9685879349708557
"The unemployment rate hovered near 50-year lows for roughly 2 years, well below most estimates of its sustainable level.",2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.7912841439247131
And the unemployment rate captures only part of the story.,2020-08-27,DOVISH,0.6775698065757751
"The Black and Hispanic unemployment rates reached record lows, and the differentials between these rates and the white unemployment rate narrowed to their lowest levels on record.14 As we heard repeatedly in our Fed Listens events, the robust job market was delivering life-changing gains for many individuals, families, and communities, particularly at the lower end of the income spectrum.15 In addition, many who had been left behind for too long were finding jobs, benefiting their families and communities, and increasing the productive capacity of our economy.",2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.7501497268676758
"It is hard to overstate the benefits of sustaining a strong labor market, a key national goal that will require a range of policies in addition to supportive monetary policy.",2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.4758186638355255
"Fourth, the historically strong labor market did not trigger a significant rise in inflation.",2020-08-27,DOVISH,0.580082356929779
"Over the years, forecasts from FOMC participants and private-sector analysts routinely showed a return to 2 percent inflation, but these forecasts were never realized on a sustained basis (see figure 3).",2020-08-27,DOVISH,0.7859605550765991
"Inflation forecasts are typically predicated on estimates of the natural rate of unemployment, or ""u-star,"" and of how much upward pressure on inflation arises when the unemployment rate falls relative to u-star.16 As the unemployment rate moved lower and inflation remained muted, estimates of u-star were revised down.",2020-08-27,DOVISH,0.8203610181808472
"The muted responsiveness of inflation to labor market tightness, which we refer to as the flattening of the Phillips curve, also contributed to low inflation outcomes.17 In addition, longer-term inflation expectations, which we have long seen as an important driver of actual inflation, and global disinflationary pressures may have been holding down inflation more than was generally anticipated.",2020-08-27,NEUTRAL,0.9854159951210022
Other advanced economies have also struggled to achieve their inflation goals in recent decades.,2020-08-27,DOVISH,0.8105072975158691
The persistent undershoot of inflation from our 2 percent longer-run objective is a cause for concern.,2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.9652293920516968
Many find it counterintuitive that the Fed would want to push up inflation.,2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.5065551996231079
"After all, low and stable inflation is essential for a well-functioning economy.",2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.9491332769393921
"And we are certainly mindful that higher prices for essential items, such as food, gasoline, and shelter, add to the burdens faced by many families, especially those struggling with lost jobs and incomes.",2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.978538453578949
"However, inflation that is persistently too low can pose serious risks to the economy.",2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.8490511775016785
"Inflation that runs below its desired level can lead to an unwelcome fall in longer-term inflation expectations, which, in turn, can pull actual inflation even lower, resulting in an adverse cycle of ever-lower inflation and inflation expectations.",2020-08-27,NEUTRAL,0.9948705434799194
This dynamic is a problem because expected inflation feeds directly into the general level of interest rates.,2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.9027109742164612
"Well-anchored inflation expectations are critical for giving the Fed the latitude to support employment when necessary without destabilizing inflation.18 But if inflation expectations fall below our 2 percent objective, interest rates would decline in tandem.",2020-08-27,NEUTRAL,0.9517620801925659
"In turn, we would have less scope to cut interest rates to boost employment during an economic downturn, further diminishing our capacity to stabilize the economy through cutting interest rates.",2020-08-27,NEUTRAL,0.6952193975448608
One of the clear messages we heard was that the strong labor market that prevailed before the pandemic was generating employment opportunities for many Americans who in the past had not found jobs readily available.,2020-08-27,DOVISH,0.6918895244598389
"A clear takeaway from these events was the importance of achieving and sustaining a strong job market, particularly for people from low- and moderate-income communities.",2020-08-27,NEUTRAL,0.639422595500946
"When we resumed our discussions last month, we turned our attention to distilling the most important lessons of the review in a revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.",2020-08-27,DOVISH,0.7150490880012512
"New Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy The federated structure of the Federal Reserve, reflected in the FOMC, ensures that we always have a diverse range of perspectives on monetary policy, and that is certainly the case today.",2020-08-27,DOVISH,0.8858650922775269
"Our new consensus statement, like its predecessor, explains how we interpret the mandate Congress has given us and describes the broad framework that we believe will best promote our maximum-employment and price-stability goals.",2020-08-27,DOVISH,0.7361566424369812
"We continue to believe that specifying a numerical goal for employment is unwise, because the maximum level of employment is not directly measurable and changes over time for reasons unrelated to monetary policy.",2020-08-27,DOVISH,0.9412117600440979
The significant shifts in estimates of the natural rate of unemployment over the past decade reinforce this point.,2020-08-27,DOVISH,0.9641655683517456
"In addition, we have not changed our view that a longer-run inflation rate of 2 percent is most consistent with our mandate to promote both maximum employment and price stability.",2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.7367426156997681
"Finally, we continue to believe that monetary policy must be forward looking, taking into account the expectations of households and businesses and the lags in monetary policy's effect on the economy.",2020-08-27,DOVISH,0.8946024179458618
Our new statement explicitly acknowledges the challenges posed by the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound.,2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.97504723072052
"By reducing our scope to support the economy by cutting interest rates, the lower bound increases downward risks to employment and inflation.22 To counter these risks, we are prepared to use our full range of tools to support the economy.",2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.5998327732086182
"With regard to the employment side of our mandate, our revised statement emphasizes that maximum employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal.",2020-08-27,NEUTRAL,0.7059681415557861
"This change reflects our appreciation for the benefits of a strong labor market, particularly for many in low- and moderate-income communities.23 In addition, our revised statement says that our policy decision will be informed by our ""assessments of the shortfalls of employment from its maximum level"" rather than by ""deviations from its maximum level"" as in our previous statement.24 This change may appear subtle, but it reflects our view that a robust job market can be sustained without causing an outbreak of inflation.",2020-08-27,NEUTRAL,0.8022213578224182
"In earlier decades when the Phillips curve was steeper, inflation tended to rise noticeably in response to a strengthening labor market.",2020-08-27,DOVISH,0.5300658941268921
It was sometimes appropriate for the Fed to tighten monetary policy as employment rose toward its estimated maximum level in order to stave off an unwelcome rise in inflation.,2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.9835227131843567
"The change to ""shortfalls"" clarifies that, going forward, employment can run at or above real-time estimates of its maximum level without causing concern, unless accompanied by signs of unwanted increases in inflation or the emergence of other risks that could impede the attainment of our goals.25 Of course, when employment is below its maximum level, as is clearly the case now, we will actively seek to minimize that shortfall by using our tools to support economic growth and job creation.",2020-08-27,NEUTRAL,0.981045126914978
We have also made important changes with regard to the price-stability side of our mandate.,2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.9010576605796814
Our longer-run goal continues to be an inflation rate of 2 percent.,2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.5786542892456055
Our statement emphasizes that our actions to achieve both sides of our dual mandate will be most effective if longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.,2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.9691595435142517
"However, if inflation runs below 2 percent following economic downturns but never moves above 2 percent even when the economy is strong, then, over time, inflation will average less than 2 percent.",2020-08-27,NEUTRAL,0.849489688873291
"Households and businesses will come to expect this result, meaning that inflation expectations would tend to move below our inflation goal and pull realized inflation down.",2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.9497748613357544
"To prevent this outcome and the adverse dynamics that could ensue, our new statement indicates that we will seek to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time.",2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.9726861715316772
"Therefore, following periods when inflation has been running below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.",2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.6591513156890869
"In seeking to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, we are not tying ourselves to a particular mathematical formula that defines the average.",2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.7060520052909851
"Thus, our approach could be viewed as a flexible form of average inflation targeting.26 Our decisions about appropriate monetary policy will continue to reflect a broad array of considerations and will not be dictated by any formula.",2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.5859778523445129
"Of course, if excessive inflationary pressures were to build or inflation expectations were to ratchet above levels consistent with our goal, we would not hesitate to act.",2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.9731897711753845
The revisions to our statement add up to a robust updating of our monetary policy framework.,2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.7179766297340393
"Overall, our new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy conveys our continued strong commitment to achieving our goals, given the difficult challenges presented by the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound.",2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.9829981327056885
"In conducting monetary policy, we will remain highly focused on fostering as strong a labor market as possible for the benefit of all Americans.",2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.5257270932197571
And we will steadfastly seek to achieve a 2 percent inflation rate over time.,2020-08-27,HAWKISH,0.9102027416229248
The emergence of sustained inflationary pressures in the 1960s and 1970s and central banks' long and difficult struggle to combat these pressures helped forge this consensus.,2003-02-12,HAWKISH,0.5103884339332581
Inflation began to drift higher during the Vietnam War and flared into double digits following the sharp increases in oil prices in the middle and late 1970s.,2003-02-12,HAWKISH,0.7724949717521667
Although snapping the inflationary spiral was painful for our nation--the recession of the early 1980s was the deepest since the Great Depression--the subsequent prosperity in terms of income growth and economic stability has been unprecedented.,2003-02-12,DOVISH,0.7458328008651733
The experience deepened the conviction of many economists and central bankers that economic policies that push an economy to operate beyond its long-run potential to produce inevitably lead to rising rates of inflation.,2003-02-12,HAWKISH,0.9781429767608643
"Moreover, the strong economic performance of the U.S. economy following the taming of inflation has supported the view that price stability fosters economic efficiency and higher productivity.",2003-02-12,HAWKISH,0.9458824992179871
"Indeed, price stability is now a formal objective included in the charters of nearly all central banks.",2003-02-12,HAWKISH,0.9708251357078552

"Many nations or economic regions, including the United Kingdom and the euro area, have adopted price stability as their primary objective.",2003-02-12,HAWKISH,0.9531705379486084

Our experience in the United States has been that multiple objectives for policy do not undermine policy performance when the public is convinced that the central bank is committed to price stability over the long run.,2003-02-12,HAWKISH,0.5561515092849731
"Indeed, the commitment to long-run price stability can afford the central bank some flexibility in employing its tools to address shorter-run economic issues.",2003-02-12,DOVISH,0.6531500816345215

"Specifically, it is time to bring the budget deficits under control.",2004-06-24,HAWKISH,0.9643685221672058
But the manner in which the process of deficit reduction is framed can strongly influence the likelihood of success.,2004-06-24,HAWKISH,0.6462355256080627
"The CBO and the JCT provide credible estimates of taxes, spending, and deficits based on a common set of assumptions.",2004-06-24,DOVISH,0.9380161166191101
"For example, by today's cash-based yardstick, the federal budget posted surpluses from 1998 to 2001; yet, if the budget definitions had included the costs of future Medicare and Social Security benefits accrued over this period, the budget likely would have shown substantial deficits.",2004-06-24,DOVISH,0.9438934922218323

"Some have suggested moving to an accrual-based accounting system, where the deficit would better account for future obligations and revenues.",2004-06-24,DOVISH,0.9086373448371887
"For example, to calculate generational accounts, one must specify the future path of numerous economic and demographic variables like wages, capital income, immigration, longevity, health costs, and inflation.1 One must also specify a discount rate in order to calculate present values--a choice that would likely be controversial and that could greatly affect the results.",2004-06-24,DOVISH,0.9770967364311218
"Thus, they measure the fiscal burden under the assumption that current tax policy is continued, Social Security benefits are not curtailed, and Medicare spending continues to rise with health costs.2 The information provided by generational accounts and other similar methods would definitely be valuable, but their computational methods seem too complicated and rely too much on assumptions about future variables to make them a viable alternative to the current deficit as the main benchmark of fiscal policy.",2004-06-24,DOVISH,0.8935366868972778
Overall Deficit Targets A second approach to controlling budget deficits is for the Congress to establish budget targets.,2004-06-24,HAWKISH,0.5816301107406616
This approach was the centerpiece of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985--commonly known as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings (GRH) Act.,2004-06-24,DOVISH,0.7257186770439148
That act aimed to wipe out the deficit in five years.,2004-06-24,HAWKISH,0.8454230427742004
It did so by establishing annual targets--declining to zero--for the budget deficit.,2004-06-24,HAWKISH,0.7683954238891602
"The process worked as follows: If projected deficits in the next fiscal year exceeded the targets by $10 billion or more, the legislation mandated that unprotected programs be cut, across-the-board, and by enough to reach the legislated targets.",2004-06-24,HAWKISH,0.7796079516410828
GRH did not allow changes in external circumstances to affect the budget deficit targets.,2004-06-24,DOVISH,0.90079265832901
Spending cuts were to be enforced regardless of whether the deficit picture had deteriorated because of worsening economic circumstances or because of congressional action.,2004-06-24,HAWKISH,0.6344548463821411
"The actual deficit did not meet the target in any of the years GRH was law, in part because, during this period, external events, such as the savings and loan crisis, tended to overtake the policies that the Congress had enacted to try to close the budget gaps.",2004-06-24,HAWKISH,0.5744732022285461
"For example, the Stability and Growth Pact of the European Monetary Union specifies that the budget deficits of member countries are not to exceed 3 percent of GDP except under some special circumstances.",2004-06-24,DOVISH,0.5703068971633911
"But the Stability and Growth Pact has been as ineffective as GRH has, and for the same reasons: Countries have resorted to budgetary gimmicks to meet the criteria, and the sanctions have not been imposed on countries that have not met their targets.",2004-06-24,DOVISH,0.6229279637336731
"Another example of deficit targets comes from the balanced-budget requirements of the states, which can be viewed as deficit targets with the target set at zero.",2004-06-24,DOVISH,0.3911716639995575
"Although states have a wide array of budgetary tricks they can and do employ to hit their deficit targets, research evidence suggests that the balanced-budget requirements do limit borrowing and that, as a result, states with more stringent requirements face somewhat lower borrowing costs.",2004-06-24,DOVISH,0.5642164945602417
"Furthermore, there seems to be a deeply held consensus that state budgets should be balanced, and this consensus undoubtedly helps legislators make the difficult choices sometimes necessary to balance state budgets.3 Hence, it may seem attractive just to limit overall deficits, but such limits have had only mixed success.",2004-06-24,DOVISH,0.879701554775238
"In a political setting, inflexible deficit limits are likely to lead more to avoidance than to real changes.",2004-06-24,HAWKISH,0.8049840927124023
This legislation replaced the system of deficit targets with two types of restraints on legislative actions.,2004-06-24,DOVISH,0.5090193152427673
"Second, for revenues and entitlement programs, the BEA established a system called PAYGO (pay as you go) that required all revenue and mandatory spending legislation to be deficit-neutral over a five-year period.",2004-06-24,DOVISH,0.46937957406044006
"In other words, the PAYGO restraint didn't require the Congress to climb out of the deficit hole by any particular date, but it did prohibit the Congress from digging the hole any deeper.",2004-06-24,HAWKISH,0.44584473967552185
"Changes in the deficit resulting from changes in economic conditions, health prices, demographics, and other technical or economic factors were allowed to show through to the deficit without sanction.",2004-06-24,DOVISH,0.959388792514801
Budget deficits declined sharply from 1992 to 1997 and then turned to surpluses from 1998 through 2001.,2004-06-24,DOVISH,0.964621365070343
"To a significant extent, of course, the decline in the deficit and the emergence of surpluses were attributable to circumstances external to the budget process, including the stellar performance of the economy; the increase in equity prices, which raised tax revenues to historic highs; and the end of the Cold War, which allowed for a decrease in defense spending.",2004-06-24,DOVISH,0.5672475099563599
"But without a broad consensus to reduce the deficit, and without a mechanism to enforce that consensus, the Congress might have responded to these positive developments by increasing spending or cutting taxes.",2004-06-24,HAWKISH,0.4136313796043396
"Instead, the federal deficit was allowed to decline.",2004-06-24,HAWKISH,0.7860873937606812

It is difficult to know exactly what the deficit path would have been in the absence of the BEA.,2004-06-24,DOVISH,0.9361603260040283

"In assessing inflation faced by American consumers, economists and policymakers generally rely on the change in the consumer price index (CPI) or the change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE).5 Since January 2012, the Committee's price-stability goal has been specified as a longer-run goal of 2 percent in terms of annual PCE inflation.6 Both CPI and PCE inflation metrics are assembled from a collection of underlying elementary price indexes for narrow subsets of goods and services.7 The price changes each month for the goods and services in these subsets are combined into measures of overall inflation by calculating a weighted average of all these subindexes, where the weights are based on average aggregate consumer expenditures in each category.",2022-04-05,DOVISH,0.6635187864303589
"This measure is particularly useful, for example, in adjusting measures of overall expenditure for changes in prices to determine how much real growth has occurred between two periods.",2022-04-05,DOVISH,0.9464650750160217
Households Have Different Inflation Experiences Each household in the United States has a particular consumption bundle whose prices and quantities combine to make up that household's cost of living.,2022-04-05,DOVISH,0.9739475250244141
The change in such a cost-of-living index would represent the average inflation experienced by U.S. households.,2022-04-05,DOVISH,0.9409926533699036
"Instead, because the CPI and PCE indexes weight every dollar of expenditure equally, these indexes implicitly weight each household's cost of living proportionally to their total expenditure.8 Since lower-income households represent a relatively smaller share of overall expenditure, the inflation associated with their consumption baskets is underrepresented in the official consumer price indexes.",2022-04-05,DOVISH,0.9788903594017029
"It would be useful to have data about consumer inflation broken out by demographic groups, similar to labor market and personal-income data, in order to assess the differential effect of inflation across different groups of households.9 U.S. statistical agencies do not collect the information needed to accurately assess inflation at a household level, and it would require a large change in the way these agencies go about their work to do so.",2022-04-05,DOVISH,0.9547402858734131
"Nonetheless, recent research has begun to assess variation in the ways different households experience inflation.",2022-04-05,DOVISH,0.8645853400230408
Households at different income levels could experience differential inflation effects for several reasons: Consumption shares could differ systematically for low- and high-income households; the goods and services within each consumption category could differ; the ability to substitute for lower-priced alternatives of the same item could differ; and prices paid for the same good could differ systematically due to differences in access.,2022-04-05,DOVISH,0.9784406423568726
"First, low- and moderate-income households could experience inflation that diverges from the average because their consumption baskets differ systematically from the average.",2022-04-05,DOVISH,0.8076989054679871
10 Lower-income households spend 77 percent of their income on necessitiesâ€”more than double the 31 percent of income spent by higher-income households on these categories.11 Several studies have found that the consumption baskets of lower-income households have experienced higher-than-average inflation rates over time.,2022-04-05,HAWKISH,0.8847479224205017
Research from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has examined the effect of different consumption baskets by using the same elementary price indexes as used in the official CPI but assigning the weights of these components to reflect the consumption bundles of different types of households.,2022-04-05,DOVISH,0.9715969562530518
"A 2021 working paper by BLS staff based on data from 2003 to 2018 found that a price index reflecting the consumption basket for households in the lowest-income quartile grew faster than the overall CPI, while a price index reflecting the consumption basket for households in the highest-income quartile grew more slowly than the overall CPI.12 A 2015 BLS study found a similar result using data from 1982 to 2014.13 Of course, the recent sharp increases in inflation may have affected the consumption bundles of lower-income households relative to the average differently than in previous cycles.",2022-04-05,HAWKISH,0.6657724976539612

"Finally, beyond the variation in inflation that comes from households buying different goods, research also shows that differences in inflation can result from households paying different prices for identical goods.",2022-04-05,DOVISH,0.9504379630088806
"Using transaction-level data, researchers found that almost two-thirds of the variation in inflation across households comes from differences in prices paid for identical goods, with only about one-third coming from differences in the mix of goods within broad categories.14 As a result of these differences, households with lower incomes, more household members, or older household heads experienced higher inflation on average.",2022-04-05,DOVISH,0.5232253670692444
"Variations in the prices paid for identical goods could reflect differences in the ability of some households to stock up when prices are discounted or to buy in bulk and saveâ€”options only available to households with the means to buy in larger quantities, adequate capacity to store larger quantities, or the flexibility to delay purchases if there is an opportunity to save in the future.",2022-04-05,DOVISH,0.9638196229934692

"November 19, 2021 Perspectives on Global Monetary Policy Coordination, Cooperation, and Correlation Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the ""Macroeconomic Policy and Global Economic Recovery"" 2021 Asia Economic Policy Conference, sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Center for Pacific Basin Studies, San Francisco, California (via webcast) Share Watch Live In my remarks today, I would like to offer some perspectives on global monetary policy correlation and what it canâ€”and cannotâ€”reveal about the prevalence and value of global monetary policy coordination or, in the limit, binding global monetary cooperation.1 In both the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the Global Pandemic Collapse (GPC), major central banks around the world responded by cutting policy rates to, and then keeping them at, their effective lower bounds (ELBs); by increasing their balance sheets through ambitious and expansive large-scale asset purchase and lending programs; and by offering forward guidanceâ€”both Delphic and Odysseanâ€”on the stance of their future monetary policies.2 As these examples make clear, we certainly do observe that national monetary policies are often correlated, and such examples are not confined to recent experience.",2021-11-19,NEUTRAL,0.9667454957962036
"Indeed, the international monetary economics literature abounds with historical and empirical studies of correlated global monetary policy cycles, not to mention the evident secular downtrend in global monetary policy rates observed in recent decades.",2021-11-19,DOVISH,0.6330781579017639
"To begin with the theory, it has long been appreciated that in the sorts of economic models used by central banks around the world, the calibrated gains to international monetary policy cooperation are found to be rather modest relative to a status quo ante in which each country runs a sensible policy, taking as given the sensible policies of the other countries.",2021-11-19,DOVISH,0.9339981079101562
"Today I will make a somewhat different, and less often discussed, case questioning formal global monetary policy cooperationâ€”that, in practice, adopting it could plausibly erode central bank credibility and public support for central bank instrument independence.",2021-11-19,DOVISH,0.806013822555542
"International monetary policy coordination, which I think of as including the sharing of information and analysis among central banks regarding the evolution of their individual economies as well as the considerations that govern the setting of their policy instrumentsâ€”in other words, information about their policy reaction functions can, and in my observation certainly does, enhance the design and effectiveness of monetary policy execution for each country.",2021-11-19,DOVISH,0.934730052947998
"But while international monetary policy coordination may enhance the efficiency of monetary policy execution, I am skeptical that in practice there are additional material, reliable, and robust gains that would flow from a formal regime of binding monetary policy cooperation, at least among major G-7 economies with flexible exchange rates, open capital accounts, and central bank mandates that include price stability.",2021-11-19,DOVISH,0.940742015838623
"In such a regime, national monetary policies in each country would be constrained to be set in such a way so as to jointly maximize some metric for global price stability and perhaps also other objectives.",2021-11-19,HAWKISH,0.8579884767532349
The reason is that there can be global externalities to monetary policy that create such theoretical gains to cooperation.,2021-11-19,DOVISH,0.887622594833374
"However, as Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2002), among others, have shown in the context of central banks with domestic price-stability mandates, to achieve the theoretical gains to international monetary policy cooperation, policy in each country must be set with reference to an index of inflation in all countries party to the cooperative agreement.",2021-11-19,DOVISH,0.9162132740020752
"This is a policy that no central bank would choose were it not bound to the agreement to achieve domestic price stability while taking other central banks' policies as given, which, of course, raises the question of how such an agreement might be enforced.",2021-11-19,HAWKISH,0.5902394652366638
"But in practice, no sovereign central bank outsources its policy to an Excel spreadsheet, and, moreover, best-practice policy rules incorporate inputsâ€”such as the neutral rate of interest or expected inflationâ€”that are unobserved and time varying and thus difficult to monitor.",2021-11-19,DOVISH,0.938319981098175

"So even though all major central banks are mandated to achieve ""price stability"" in some form or fashion, their mandates typically include other obligations that vary across jurisdictions.",2021-11-19,DOVISH,0.5511149764060974
"Because these obligations can, and sometimes do, require central banks to make a tradeoffâ€”for example, in the United States, between inflation and employment in the presence of supply shocksâ€”defining the objective that a cooperative agreement would choose to maximize would be a formidable task.",2021-11-19,DOVISH,0.9652974009513855
"Simply stated and in the context of a price-stability mandate for each central bank, the problemâ€”as I see itâ€”is the threat to the credibility of the central bank, the challenges to central bank communication, and the resulting potential loss of support for its policy actions from the public when the policy choices that would be required by binding monetary policy cooperation react not only to home inflation deviations from target, but also to deviations of foreign inflation from target.",2021-11-19,HAWKISH,0.728702962398529
"In theoretical models, the commitment to the inflation target is just assumed to be perfect and credible, but in practice, credibility appears to be a function of central bank communication and of the policies actually implemented pushing inflation towardâ€”and, in the absence of shocks, keeping inflation atâ€”target.",2021-11-19,DOVISH,0.8471599221229553

"For example, even if home and foreign inflation rates and trend growth rates are uncorrelated across countries, sensible monetary policies can be correlated across countries if neutral policy rates are correlated, as they appear to be in the data (see figure 2, which is based on Holston, Laubach, and Williams, 2017).",2021-11-19,DOVISH,0.9696567058563232

"What we can say is that the necessary policy move would have to be quite large--many percentage points on the federal funds rate--and we would be highly uncertain about its magnitude or its ultimate effects on stock prices and the economy.15,16 Second, we have seen that monetary tightening reduces stock prices primarily by increasing the risk premium for holding stocks, as opposed to raising the real interest rate or lowering expected dividends.",2003-10-02,HAWKISH,0.8725273609161377
"This evidence supports the proposition that monetary policy can lower stock values only to the extent that it weakens the broader economy, and in particular that it makes households considerably worse off.",2003-10-02,NEUTRAL,0.8261172771453857
"Indeed, according to our analysis, policy would have to weaken the general economy quite significantly to obtain a large decline in stock prices.",2003-10-02,DOVISH,0.8109521269798279
The observation that asset prices influence macroeconomic performance is hardly new.,2001-11-30,DOVISH,0.9520521759986877
Undergraduate macroeconomic textbooks generally teach that increases in wealth should boost household spending and that increases in stock prices should stimulate business investment.,2001-11-30,DOVISH,0.874492883682251
"First, I will discuss the available empirical evidence from the United States on the effect of changes in asset prices on household consumption and business investment.",2001-11-30,DOVISH,0.9802653789520264
"Second, I will highlight a few aspects of the relationship between asset prices and household spending that I believe merit further research.",2001-11-30,DOVISH,0.957904040813446

"Empirical Evidence on Asset Prices and Spending At the aggregate level, a wealth effect on consumption has been a mainstay of large-scale econometric models for at least thirty years.",2001-11-30,DOVISH,0.9664579033851624
"Personal saving--which is measured in the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts as the difference between disposable income and outlays--dropped from 6-1/2 percent of disposable income at the end of 1994 to roughly 1 percent in early 2000, when equity prices peaked.",2001-11-30,DOVISH,0.849522590637207
The magnitude of this decline is consistent with the runup in equity prices and the marginal propensity to consume out of equity wealth that appears in the Fed’s model.,2001-11-30,HAWKISH,0.45447877049446106
"For example, one study that analyzed the response of individual households to changes in stock market wealth found that, over the 1983-to-1999 period, the spending of U.S. households that own stocks responded to movements in the stock market, whereas the spending of non-holders of stocks has no apparent link to stock prices.1 A second study has estimated that, in the second half of the 1990s, households in the top of the income and education distributions in the United States showed the largest consumption increases, consistent with the fact that these households owned the most stocks and experienced the largest gains in wealth.2 Unfortunately, microeconomic evidence on the link between housing wealth and consumption is much more limited.",2001-11-30,DOVISH,0.9802281260490417
But the substantial gains in housing wealth that have been experienced in recent years and the disparate movement of house and equity prices make this an issue of both policy and academic interest.,2001-11-30,DOVISH,0.5100507736206055
"To be sure, not every analysis of the link between stock prices and spending comes to the same conclusions as those of the studies I mentioned.",2001-11-30,DOVISH,0.887255072593689
"When we turn to business spending, the evidence in support of a direct causal link from equity prices to business investment is weaker.",2001-11-30,DOVISH,0.9507129192352295
"Indeed, neither Tobin’s q nor other approaches to formalizing the effect of equity prices on business investment have fared well in most empirical tests.",2001-11-30,DOVISH,0.9333192110061646
Other influences on business investment aside from asset-price fluctuations--such as the acceleration in business output and the cash flow of firms--often have proven more robust and more important explanators of capital spending than stock prices.,2001-11-30,DOVISH,0.9621415138244629
"However, some careful research--again partly conducted by Federal Reserve economists--suggests that a cost-of-capital effect on investment comes through clearly in empirical models based either on natural experiments with exogenous shocks to the cost of capital or on other econometric techniques that identify the exogenous parts of observed changes in user cost.3 Other recent work suggests that investment is also affected by at least those movements in stock prices that reflect the discounted value of expected profits.4 This important literature is too complex for me to review in detail today.",2001-11-30,DOVISH,0.9864187836647034
"Let me say simply that, despite the empirical puzzles, I believe that the cost-of-capital effect is likely to be at work when stock prices rise or fall significantly.",2001-11-30,DOVISH,0.9830095171928406
"The discount factors incorporate both risk-free interest rates and equity premia, but I will refer to the discount factors simply as interest rates.",2001-11-30,DOVISH,0.9279037714004517
"Consider the effect of an increase in expected profits, say from a spurt in productivity.",2001-11-30,DOVISH,0.6337761282920837
"Now consider instead the effect of a decrease in interest rates, setting aside for a moment the implications of the interest-rate decline for investment and future output.",2001-11-30,NEUTRAL,0.9682042598724365
A further complication in evaluating these two scenarios is that the aggregate response of household spending and investment will generally feed back to asset markets and generate further changes in prices and discount rates.,2001-11-30,DOVISH,0.9517752528190613
But the basic point is that wealth changes reflecting future profits (or productivity) and wealth changes reflecting interest rates could have very different effects on consumption.,2001-11-30,DOVISH,0.9765797257423401
I believe that further research on both the theoretical and empirical aspects of this issue could contribute significantly to our understanding of the relationship between asset prices and macroeconomic outcomes.,2001-11-30,DOVISH,0.9551151394844055
"The basic puzzle is this: Roughly speaking, the population currently occupies the stock of residential real estate and will continue to do so no matter what happens to its price.",2001-11-30,DOVISH,0.9557861089706421
Suppose there is a rise in the relative price of housing.,2001-11-30,HAWKISH,0.795387327671051
"To articulate the puzzle more carefully, suppose that I intend to live in my current house forever and that the price of the house increases because of a decline in the discount rate for future housing services.",2001-11-30,HAWKISH,0.7952693104743958
"Yet, as I noted earlier, the empirical evidence supports the view that changes in the price of residential real estate do affect household spending.",2001-11-30,DOVISH,0.9760180711746216
"One possibility is that the hypothesized increase in the price of my house reflects a change in the housing services that the house is expected to provide, perhaps because individuals have come to think that houses will depreciate more slowly in the future than we had believed.",2001-11-30,HAWKISH,0.8319956660270691
"In this situation, a higher house price would be accompanied by an increase in my real consumption of housing services over time but--as long as I stayed in the same house--by no change in my consumption of other goods and services.",2001-11-30,DOVISH,0.8122536540031433
"These individuals, who plan to “downsize” their housing over time, are truly better off when house prices increase, and any standard theory would predict that they will increase their consumption.",2001-11-30,HAWKISH,0.7420894503593445
"These “upsizers” are worse off when house prices increase, and they will reduce their consumption of non-housing goods and services.",2001-11-30,HAWKISH,0.7179667949676514
The effect of changes in house prices on desired aggregate consumption depends on the relative number of individuals in these two groups and their marginal propensities to consume out of housing wealth.,2001-11-30,DOVISH,0.9903085827827454
"In addition, its value is somewhat uncertain: Although general trends in real estate prices can be easily observed, nobody receives a statement in the mail saying how much his or her home is worth, and nobody can look up the value of his or her home in the newspaper.",2001-11-30,DOVISH,0.9403809309005737

"Since the peak, the Wilshire 5000 has dropped by about one-third, corresponding to a loss in wealth of roughly $6 trillion.5 Not only have the recent movements in U.S. stock prices been extremely large, they have arguably affected more households than did past movements in the stock market because of the broadening ownership of corporate equities in the United States.",2001-11-30,NEUTRAL,0.4920750558376312

The pickup in investment combined with the wealth effect on consumption to boost aggregate demand.,2001-11-30,HAWKISH,0.6290131211280823
The rapid pace of investment also helped to hold down inflationary pressures by increasing the growth of productive capacity.,2001-11-30,HAWKISH,0.9022785425186157
"However, by the summer of 1999, the persistent strength of domestic demand and tightening resource utilization in the United States, especially for labor, heightened concern among policymakers that inflationary pressures could undermine the impressive performance of the economy.",2001-11-30,HAWKISH,0.9749917984008789

"The title of this year's conference was ""New Challenges for Monetary Policy.""",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.8415151238441467
The papers described both the emerging consensus about the objectives and strategies underlying the conduct of monetary policy and highlighted a number of new challenges.,1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.838919460773468
"In the first section of today's lecture I will outline the framework and identify the objectives of monetary policy, describe the operational procedures used to conduct monetary policy, and discuss the strategy for carrying out monetary policy to achieve those objectives.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.872969925403595
"A number of participates at the conference suggested that there was an emerging consensus about the appropriate strategy--specifically, flexible inflation targeting.",1999-10-12,HAWKISH,0.7956181764602661
Then I will turn to the new challenges for monetary policy identified at the conference.,1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.7601820826530457
"First, does a low-inflation environment--and specifically the possibility that nominal interest rates might decline to zero in such an environment--constrain the effectiveness of monetary policy, and if so, how can monetary policy adjust to maintain its effectiveness?",1999-10-12,NEUTRAL,0.9759913086891174
"Second, how should monetary policy respond to movements in asset prices in general and, specifically, to the possibility of asset-market bubbles?",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9651252627372742
"Third, what is the best option for exchange rate and monetary policy regimes for small open emerging market countries, in light of increased globalization and especially larger and more volatile international capital flows?",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9802651405334473
The basic theme of the conference was that flexible inflation targeting provides a constructive response to each of these challenges.,1999-10-12,HAWKISH,0.7707083225250244
"Careful design and implementation of the framework, including the choice of an inflation target, would, for example, reduce the prospect that monetary policy might lose its ability to stimulate the economy further because nominal short-term interest rates had fallen to zero.",1999-10-12,NEUTRAL,0.9621400833129883
"Similarly, following such a disciplined monetary policy would mitigate, though not entirely eliminate, the effect of asset bubbles.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.6195881962776184
"Finally, countries that move to a flexible exchange rate regime--as many have done recently--need to put in place a disciplined monetary framework such as is offered by this approach.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.565887987613678
"The Monetary Policy Framework Let me start this discussion by identifying what the objectives of monetary policy are, and should be, and then discuss what strategies are useful in achieving the objectives.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9116626977920532
"Objectives of Monetary Policy One of the themes of the conference was that there is an emerging consensus about the objectives of monetary policy, one that has been reflected in the conduct of monetary policy in many countries for some time and now is finding its way into the rhetoric of policymakers.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9359445571899414
I would describe the consensus as an acceptance of a dual mandate for monetary policy.,1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.8092108368873596
"Monetary policy seeks first to achieve and maintain price stability over the longer run and, second, to retain the flexibility to damp cyclical fluctuations in the economy around full employment.",1999-10-12,HAWKISH,0.8492711782455444
"At the conference, the consensus was described as ""flexible inflation targeting.""",1999-10-12,HAWKISH,0.773822009563446
"Most central banks want to emphasize, with good reason, their price stability objective.",1999-10-12,HAWKISH,0.9815164804458618
"First, monetary policy, in the long run, principally affects nominal variables such as nominal income, the price level, and the rate of inflation, but has lesser effects on real variables--such as the level of employment or the level or growth rate of output.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.982144832611084
I expect all central bankers would agree that an environment of price stability offers the best contribution that monetary policy can make to the level and growth of output because it eliminates distortions to resource allocation and disincentives to saving and investment associated with high and variable inflation rates.,1999-10-12,HAWKISH,0.967825710773468
It follows that a more accommodative monetary policy cannot foster a higher average rate of real growth.,1999-10-12,HAWKISH,0.4589163064956665
"The second strongly held view is that because monetary policy is the principal determinant of the inflation rate in the long run, central banks have a responsibility to set an appropriate target for long-run inflation and achieve it.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.875582218170166
"And that target should be price stability or, at the least, a low rate of inflation.",1999-10-12,HAWKISH,0.9698939323425293
"While monetary policy cannot raise the level or rate of growth of output over the long run through any means other than maintaining price stability, it is widely, though not universally, accepted that monetary policy can affect the level and growth rate of output in the short run and, perhaps, therefore contribute to smoothing out fluctuations in the economy around full employment.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9131293296813965
This is sometimes referred to as the short-run stabilization objective for monetary policy.,1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.8632269501686096
A central issue for monetary policy is how to balance the dual objectives of price stability and output stabilization and how explicit to be about the commitment to these dual objectives.,1999-10-12,HAWKISH,0.7601462006568909
"Both theoretical and, especially, empirical macroeconomics have established the existence of an inescapable trade-off affecting the conduct of monetary policy.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9701477885246277
The trade-off is between the variability of inflation around its target (zero or some low rate) and the variability of output around its target (the full-employment level of output or potential output).,1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9214398860931396
"Autonomous increases or decreases in aggregate spending push output and inflation in the same direction relative to their targets and, therefore, do not bring this trade-off into play.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9759461879730225
But supply shocks--such as increases or decreases in oil or food prices--drive output and inflation in opposite directions relative to their respective targets.,1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9820820689201355
"The more quickly monetary policy reacts to restore inflation to its target following a supply shock, the greater will be the variability in output relative to its target.",1999-10-12,HAWKISH,0.9482432007789612
The reason for this trade-off is that monetary policy affects inflation primarily through its initial effect on the amount of slack in the economy.,1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.971532940864563
"Tightening monetary policy slows spending growth, opens up some slack temporarily in labor and product markets, and allows the slack to reduce inflation.",1999-10-12,HAWKISH,0.9213002324104309
"Once inflation has returned to its target, policy can guide the economy back to full employment.",1999-10-12,NEUTRAL,0.6765766143798828
"It probably takes a certain amount of slack over time to reduce inflation by a given amount, but reducing inflation rapidly means opening up an especially large output gap for a short period--hence the trade-off between inflation and output stability.",1999-10-12,HAWKISH,0.9254361987113953
"Several countries have moved to inflation-targeting regimes over the last decade or so, setting a numerical target for inflation.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.6575520038604736
"This was generally part of a process of shifting responsibility for monetary policy from finance ministries to independent central banks and often followed a period of poor macroeconomic performance, especially high and variable inflation.",1999-10-12,HAWKISH,0.870590329170227
The newly independent central banks often identified inflation as the singular objective of monetary policy to gain credibility and facilitate the transition to price stability.,1999-10-12,HAWKISH,0.919815719127655
"With price stability now largely accomplished, some of these central banks are becoming more flexible in their approaches to monetary policy by recognizing a role for short-run stabilization.",1999-10-12,HAWKISH,0.9866592884063721
"In the United States, Congress has set the objectives for monetary policy in the Federal Reserve Act, as amended in 1977.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.920363187789917
"The objectives are maximum employment and stable prices, which are mutually consistent and achievable if maximum employment is interpreted as the maximum employment sustainable without rising or falling inflation.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.7537527084350586
"Inflation-targeting countries typically have goals of about 2 percent to 2 ½ percent for inflation and sometimes establish a range for inflation, for example, 1 percent to 3 percent.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9092404842376709
"It was widely agreed at Jackson Hole that the United States has, without an explicit target, achieved the same success in reducing inflation as countries with explicit numerical targets.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.6325362324714661
"I will not be considering the pros and cons of an explicit numerical target for inflation today, although I recognize this is an important question and one that warrants further discussion.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.8948082327842712
"Virtually all central banks carry out monetary policy operations by influencing--in effect setting--some short-term nominal interest rate, typically the rate on overnight inter-bank loans.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9844685196876526
"By adjusting this single rate, the Federal Reserve affects the broader array of interest rates and asset prices in the economy and, in turn, affects aggregate demand, the level of real economic activity, and inflation.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9830573201179504
There are two ways of describing the strategy for monetary policy.,1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.8560301065444946
"One focuses on ""instrument rules,"" which describe how the policy instrument--in this case a short-term interest rate--should be moved in response to economic developments.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9697269201278687
The Taylor Rule describes how the federal funds rate should be adjusted in response to movements in output relative to its long-run sustainable level and to movements in inflation relative to its target.,1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9859387874603271
The Taylor Rule thus explicitly embodies the dual objectives of monetary policy and is a form of flexible inflation targeting.,1999-10-12,HAWKISH,0.8298877477645874
"In practice, no one expects monetary policy to be conducted according to a rigid rule.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.8624922037124634
"Such rules can, however, be useful in informing policy decisions and helping policymakers calibrate their responses to changes in utilization and inflation rates.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9509004354476929
A second strategy is to move the instrument in response to the inflation forecast.,1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.5494521856307983
"In this approach, the policymakers start with a forecast of inflation over some interval, typically about two years.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9146749377250671
Policy is then set over this interval to achieve the price stability target by the end of the period.,1999-10-12,HAWKISH,0.9004796147346497
"The interval chosen to reach the inflation target takes into account the fact that the more rapid the return to the target, the greater the variability in output relative to its target.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.7458463907241821
The time interval is thus a vehicle for allowing policymakers to damp movements in output around full employment and at the same time ensure that the inflation objective is eventually achieved.,1999-10-12,NEUTRAL,0.6198826432228088
Inflation forecast targeting has the advantage of being explicitly forward-looking.,1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.5296095609664917
"The Taylor Rule takes explicit account of only very recent observations on inflation and output, but these are, to be sure, important determinants of future inflation.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9675183892250061
An inflation forecast approach allows policymakers to consider a wider range of current and past information in projecting future outcomes.,1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9087280035018921
"D. Setting the Inflation Target Setting the inflation target to be consistent with price stability sounds straightforward, but an important theme at this summer's conference was the variety of options and implications of this choice.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.8945889472961426
"The obvious choice would be a target of zero for inflation, taking into account biases in published price measures.",1999-10-12,HAWKISH,0.5613300204277039
But an intriguing alternative is to set a target for the price level.,1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.8465626835823059
"If a disturbance results in a period of inflation, under a zero inflation target, the objective is to return to a zero inflation rate.",1999-10-12,HAWKISH,0.9717845916748047

"This can produce a more predictable price level in the long run, but many analysts are concerned about how the economy would respond to a period of deflation.",1999-10-12,NEUTRAL,0.6385726928710938
Yet another alternative is to target a low positive inflation rate--specifically an inflation rate somewhat above a level that reflected estimates of the bias in published measures.,1999-10-12,HAWKISH,0.9467462301254272
"One of the issues I will discuss shortly is whether targeting a low, positive rate of ""true"" inflation (what I call price stability plus cushion) might result in better cyclical performance of the economy than a zero inflation target.",1999-10-12,HAWKISH,0.917036235332489
Still another choice is an average inflation target.,1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9033547043800354
"If the target was 2 percent and inflation temporarily moved to 3 percent, an average inflation target policy would encourage a decline in the inflation rate to below 2 percent for a while, moving the average back to 2 percent.",1999-10-12,HAWKISH,0.8969472646713257

"D. How to Avoid the Problem At the Jackson Hole conference, Mervyn King and Lars Svensson argued that a flexible inflation-targeting regime would help policymakers avoid this problem in the first place.",1999-10-12,HAWKISH,0.6234533190727234
"While King in particular had some doubts about the zero nominal interest rate bound and especially about the existence of nominal rigidities, both he and Svensson noted that opting for a positive inflation rate as a target was a prudent way of avoiding testing either of these hypotheses.",1999-10-12,NEUTRAL,0.4530399739742279

Recent research suggests that even a cushion of 1 percentage point (above an amount equal to the expected bias in inflation measures) can go a long way toward avoiding the problem of deteriorating cyclical performance at low inflation rates.,1999-10-12,HAWKISH,0.6457279324531555
The second key to avoiding this problem is to have a symmetrical inflation target.,1999-10-12,HAWKISH,0.9250508546829224

A third possibility is that the zero nominal bound problem can be reduced or eliminated either by a credible price level target or by an average inflation target.,1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.7933583855628967
"If the price level falls in response to downside shocks, a price level target will imply that monetary policy will move more aggressively to stimulate the economy, once demand recovers and monetary policy has regained its effectiveness, than would have been the case with a traditional inflation target.",1999-10-12,NEUTRAL,0.9451414942741394

A similar result could be achieved by an average inflation target.,1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9106610417366028
"If inflation was zero for a while, bondholders would project a period of inflation above the long-run inflation target--for example, 3 percent or 4 percent instead of 2 percent--until the average inflation rate returned to 2 percent.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.47475314140319824

Paul Krugman has urged the Bank of Japan to move to a positive inflation target as a way of lowering real interest rates and stimulating the economy.,1999-10-12,HAWKISH,0.5792064070701599

A second approach would be to undertake unconventional monetary policy operations.,1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.6238401532173157
"Conventional monetary policy is implemented, as I described, by employing open market operations concentrated in repurchase agreements or in the short end of the government debt market.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.8420928120613098

Meltzer suggested this result reflects more the limits of the typical model than the limits on monetary policy.,1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.8443648815155029
"In an activist approach, monetary policy would increase the sum of the money supply and short-term government debt--the assets that have become perfect substitutes--by widening the scope of open market operations to include purchases of long-term government debt and perhaps private debt and foreign exchange.",1999-10-12,NEUTRAL,0.5557492971420288

This will be the outcome of deflation as long as the central bank does not let the nominal money supply decline as the price level falls.,1999-10-12,NEUTRAL,0.9788530468940735
"The net result will be lower interest rates on long-term and private securities and higher values of equities that, in turn, will stimulate spending, over and above the stimulus that results from the wealth effect associated with increased real money balances.",1999-10-12,NEUTRAL,0.9464505314826965
Important questions relate to both the theoretical structure of asset demands and empirical evidence about portfolio behavior and asset markets.,1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9055447578430176
The issue of whether relative supply of short and long-term bonds affects the term structure of interest rates is crucial.,1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9724075794219971
"The most widely accepted theory of the term structure, called the pure expectations model, holds that long-term interest rates are a weighted average of current and expected future short-term rates.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9512777924537659
"I have never given much weight to the role of relative supply effects in affecting the term structure or exchange rates, given the failure of empirical studies to find much evidence of such effects.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9132407903671265
"Of course, at the extreme, the Bank of Japan could set the price and hence interest rate on long-term bonds if it was prepared to take all these assets onto its balance sheet.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9711219668388367
Another reason for skepticism is that the domestic channel through which monetary policy works in Japan operates very importantly through the banking system.,1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.8863149881362915
"In this case, attention shifts to the effect of monetization on exchange rates and to the recommendation that the Bank of Japan raise the money supply by purchasing foreign currency, an operation sometimes referred to as unsterilized exchange rate intervention.",1999-10-12,NEUTRAL,0.830229640007019
There is a case in which unsterilized intervention has a more powerful effect on exchange rates than sterilized intervention (where the central bank absorbs any reverses introduced as part of exchange rate intervention).,1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.8855018019676208
"But this incremental effect arises because unsterilized intervention is expected to lower the country's interest rates and the lower interest rates would, in turn, put downward pressure on the country's exchange rate.",1999-10-12,NEUTRAL,0.6145578026771545
"If the interest rate channel does not operate because of a liquidity trap, this could raise questions about the effect of unsterilized foreign exchange intervention.",1999-10-12,NEUTRAL,0.655754804611206
This could affect a range of interest rates and the exchange rate.,1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9742113947868347

Asset Market Bubbles and Monetary Policy Let me move to the challenge of how monetary policy should respond to suspicions of asset market bubbles.,1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9343090653419495
An asset market bubble refers to an extended increase in the price of assets not justified by the fundamentals.,1999-10-12,HAWKISH,0.8473801612854004
"I do find it plausible that market prices might sometimes, and for some period, depart from values that are justified by fundamental forces.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9809391498565674
"The fundamental value of a stock is the present value of the expected earnings stream of the firm in question, derived by applying a discount factor that accounts for both the interest rate on safe assets and a risk factor appropriate to the uncertainties about the expected future earnings stream.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9670160412788391
The fundamentals underpinning the price of equities are therefore the expected increase in earnings and the discount rate that transforms expected earnings into a price for the asset.,1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9713560938835144
"Equity prices could rise above their fundamental value if investors hold unrealistic expectations about earnings growth, if they assume that the earnings stream is more stable than it will turn out to be, or if they otherwise believe there is less risk associated with holding the equities than turns out to be the case.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9539173245429993
A similar process underlies the price of real property.,1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.9667200446128845

Japanese banks therefore suffered a double blow in the collapse of equity and property prices.,1999-10-12,NEUTRAL,0.9325423240661621
Many have viewed the surge in equity prices in the United States over the past four years as evidence of a bubble.,1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.6897451877593994
It is true that the rise in equity prices--averaging 25 percent to 30 percent a year over the last four years--is unprecedented and that current values challenge previous valuation standards.,1999-10-12,HAWKISH,0.6374588012695312
But one could argue that structural changes in the economy have raised the sustainable level and growth of earnings and lowered the volatility of earnings or otherwise reduced the perceived risk in equities.,1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.6163703203201294
"Such structural changes could, in principle, justify at least a substantial portion of the rise in equity prices.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.920281708240509
But the question at issue here is whether policymakers should substitute their judgment about fundamental value for the market's assessment and use monetary policy to encourage a convergence back to their own estimate of fundamental value.,1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.8954713344573975

"They find that policymakers cannot improve the outcomes by responding directly to suspected deviations of equity prices from fundamentals, but that a policy focused on achieving price stability and damping fluctuations around full employment will mitigate the adverse consequences of equity market bubbles.",1999-10-12,DOVISH,0.5018642544746399
"That is, a monetary policy focused on price stability and output stabilization will respond to the effects of higher equity prices on aggregate demand, real economic activity, and inflation.",1999-10-12,HAWKISH,0.9823350310325623

(via webcast) Share It is my pleasure to meet virtually with you today at the Unconventional Convention of the American Bankers Association.1 I look forward to my conversation with Rob Nichols, but first, please allow me to offer a few remarks on the economic outlook, Federal Reserve monetary policy, and some of the initiatives we have announced to support the flow of credit to households and firms during these challenging times.",2020-10-19,DOVISH,0.9298597574234009
"The flow of macrodata received since May has been surprisingly strong, and GDP growth in the third quarter is estimated by many forecasters to have rebounded at roughly a 30 percent annual rate.",2020-10-19,HAWKISH,0.9085038900375366
This development is especially noteworthy when set in relief against the surge in new COVID-19 cases that were reported this summer in a number of U.S. states and the coincident flatlining in a number of high-frequency activity indicators that we follow to track the effect of the virus on economic activity.,2020-10-19,NEUTRAL,0.7779868245124817
These components of aggregate demand have benefited from robust fiscal supportâ€”including expanded unemployment benefits and the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)â€”as well as low interest rates and efforts by the Federal Reserve to sustain the flow of credit to households and firms.,2020-10-19,NEUTRAL,0.9830816388130188
"In the labor market, about half of the 22 million jobs that were lost in the spring have been restored, and the unemployment rate has fallen since April by nearly 7 percentage points to 7.9 percent as of September.",2020-10-19,HAWKISH,0.7678474187850952
It will likely take even longer than that for the unemployment rate to return to a level consistent with our maximum-employment mandate.,2020-10-19,NEUTRAL,0.9923484325408936
"However, it is worth highlighting that the Committee's baseline projections summarized in the most recent Summary of Economic Projections foresee a relatively rapid return to mandate-consistent levels of employment and inflation as compared with the recovery from the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).2 In particular, the median Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participant projects that by the end of 2023â€”a little more than three years from nowâ€”the unemployment rate will have fallen to 4 percent, and PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation will have returned to 2 percent.",2020-10-19,DOVISH,0.47473204135894775
"Following the GFC, it took more than eight years for employment and inflation to return to similar mandate-consistent levels.",2020-10-19,DOVISH,0.745243489742279
"We indicated that, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, our policy will aim to achieve inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal.",2020-10-19,NEUTRAL,0.7890543341636658
"We said that we expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomesâ€”as well as our maximum-employment mandateâ€”are achieved, and also that we expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent target range for the federal funds rate until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment, until inflation has risen to 2 percent, and until inflation is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.",2020-10-19,NEUTRAL,0.9919244647026062
"Concluding Remarks While recovery since the spring collapse in economic activity has been robust, let us not forget that the full economic recovery from the COVID-19 recession has a long way to go, with the unemployment rate still elevated at 7.9 percent as of September and inflation still running below our 2 percent longer-run objective.",2020-10-19,NEUTRAL,0.9935892820358276
"It will take some time to return to the levels of economic activity and employment that prevailed at the business cycle peak in February, and additional support from monetaryâ€”and likely fiscalâ€”policy will be needed.",2020-10-19,NEUTRAL,0.970899760723114

"Before I continue, please note that the opinions I express here today are my own and not necessarily shared by my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.1 In brief, I argue that globalization, deregulation, and financial innovation, in part spurred by the experiences of high inflation in the 1980s, have fostered currency competition that has led to improved central bank performance and, hence, the recent reduction of worldwide inflation.",2007-05-16,DOVISH,0.5233754515647888
The increased competition among currencies has changed the ability and the incentives of governments and central banks to pursue high-inflation policies.,2007-05-16,HAWKISH,0.8497574329376221
"Such changes have allowed improvements in central bank governance and credibility, thereby leading to better inflation outcomes, especially in many emerging-market economies.",2007-05-16,DOVISH,0.824800968170166
"In addition, greater central bank credibility has allowed the development of long-term bond markets in many countries and flattened yield curves around the globe as concerns about future inflation risks have declined.",2007-05-16,HAWKISH,0.45736631751060486
The important issue is whether the reduction of worldwide inflation will persist or be a temporary phenomenon.,2007-05-16,HAWKISH,0.8566845655441284
"The Worldwide Decline in Inflation From the 1950s until the late 1960s, inflation rates were relatively contained, and episodes of high inflation were rare.",2007-05-16,DOVISH,0.9803053140640259
"Then, especially following the early-1970s collapse of the Bretton Woods fixed-exchange-rate system, inflation became a worldwide phenomenon.",2007-05-16,HAWKISH,0.6820826530456543
"Even in Germany, which had the most stable prices of any country in the world, inflation eroded purchasing power by more than half between 1972 and the launch of the euro, in 1999.",2007-05-16,DOVISH,0.8410032391548157

"For most countries reporting data to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), cumulative inflation has been even higher than that experienced in the United States.",2007-05-16,HAWKISH,0.9806379079818726
"Here in Argentina, the price level is now about 177 billion times higher than it was in 1972.",2007-05-16,HAWKISH,0.9560787081718445
"But Brazil takes the prize for greatest inflation of the post-World War II era: The price level in Brazil is approximately 500 billion times higher today than it was in 1972.3 Since the early 1990s, however, worldwide inflation has significantly declined.",2007-05-16,HAWKISH,0.8318554162979126
"Indeed, the April 2006 issue of the IMF's World Economic Outlook shows that, on average, inflation rates in the advanced economies as well as in the developing countries in recent years have been at their lowest levels since at least the early 1970s.",2007-05-16,NEUTRAL,0.6006503105163574
The April 2007 issue forecasts inflation in both regions to remain near these recent lows through 2008.,2007-05-16,DOVISH,0.8240641355514526
But is this lower inflation regime likely to persist?,2007-05-16,HAWKISH,0.8134515285491943
One way to approach this issue is to investigate what market participants think by examining measures of expected inflation.,2007-05-16,DOVISH,0.9150369763374329
"Overall, these surveys suggest that market participants do expect relatively low inflation to continue in most major industrial and emerging-market countries.",2007-05-16,HAWKISH,0.6849263906478882
"In the industrial countries and a few Asian emerging-market economies, for example, long-term inflation expectations dropped below 5 percent a decade or more ago and are currently around 2 percent to 3 percent.4 In Brazil and Mexico, long-term inflation expectations have declined from a range of 7 percent to 10 percent a decade ago to a fairly steady 3 percent to 4 percent in recent years.",2007-05-16,DOVISH,0.8050981760025024
"In Argentina, long-term inflation expectations are around 7 percent.",2007-05-16,HAWKISH,0.5253398418426514
"In addition, the risks of high inflation appear to have decreased as well.",2007-05-16,DOVISH,0.5492274761199951
"In particular, the volatility of inflation has declined notably, especially in many emerging- market countries.5 On occasion in the early to middle 1990s, the standard deviation of inflation exceeded 30 percent in Mexico and 100 percent in Argentina and Brazil.",2007-05-16,DOVISH,0.8813110589981079
"In the current decade, however, the standard deviation of inflation has been relatively stable in Brazil, at around 5 percent, and it has been declining in Mexico, where it is now around 2 percent.",2007-05-16,DOVISH,0.9623358845710754

"Factors Behind the Taming of Worldwide Inflation My brief review of worldwide inflation performance suggests that in general, over the past decade, inflation has become substantially lower and less volatile, and expectations of future inflation have also become substantially lower.",2007-05-16,NEUTRAL,0.7957634925842285
"In understanding the key factors behind this change, we can also shed further light on the question of whether this low-inflation regime will persist.",2007-05-16,NEUTRAL,0.40476205945014954
"In a nutshell, I believe that the factors of globalization, deregulation, and financial innovation, arising partly in response to episodes of high inflation, have effectively eroded the central bank monopoly on the provision of monetary services and have enhanced global competition among currencies.",2007-05-16,DOVISH,0.9216476082801819
"The resulting constraint on monetary policy, combined with increased public understanding of the costs of inflation, have led to institutional changes in central bank governance that bolster their credibility for maintaining price stability in the future.",2007-05-16,HAWKISH,0.9861568212509155
"To develop this explanation in more detail, I will start by describing how globalization, deregulation, and innovation can alter the ability and incentives of a government to pursue a high-inflation policy.6 These factors are closely related and mutually reinforcing in many respects.",2007-05-16,DOVISH,0.598039984703064
Many countries have turned increasingly to private markets and trade to deliver growth and progress.,2007-05-16,DOVISH,0.9315440058708191
How does this affect inflation?,2007-05-16,DOVISH,0.84166419506073
"When governments resort to printing money to finance their spending, inflation rises and nominal assets lose their value.",2007-05-16,DOVISH,0.6455197930335999
This loss of value is also known as the inflation tax.,2007-05-16,HAWKISH,0.932754397392273

"When the tax base shrinks in response to inflation, governments have a reduced incentive to resort to the inflation tax.",2007-05-16,HAWKISH,0.43840327858924866
Increased circulation of banknotes in dollars or other hard currencies enable citizens to conduct transactions and store liquid wealth without holding inflationary currency.,2007-05-16,NEUTRAL,0.6039594411849976
"The fraction of U.S. currency estimated to be held in foreign countries rose dramatically over the 1980s and 1990s, from less than 20 percent to about 60 percent, and it has remained near this high level even as inflation rates have come down globally.",2007-05-16,DOVISH,0.40436574816703796
"Substantial financial innovations--including advances in electronic payment and trading systems as well as more widespread credit card networks and increased use of mutual funds--have enabled consumers, investors, and banks to shift wealth cheaply and quickly away from currencies and assets subject to inflation and related risks.",2007-05-16,DOVISH,0.9342650771141052
"Given the stronger competition among currencies, a government that pressures a central bank to pursue an inflationary policy gets much less benefit from increased inflation because people can more rapidly and conveniently switch out of the domestic currency.",2007-05-16,DOVISH,0.49542954564094543
"Indeed, the website of the Central Bank of Brazil explicitly acknowledges the role of inflation in driving financial innovations that enabled firms and households to economize on cash balances in that country.",2007-05-16,DOVISH,0.9295178651809692
"It states that, ""Prior to the mid-1990s [when inflation was stabilized], changes in the payment system in Brazil were motivated by the need to cope with high inflation rates.",2007-05-16,DOVISH,0.9055411219596863
"7 In addition to encouraging financial innovation, the painful experience of high inflation helped to educate the public and economists about the costs of inflation.8 Although the specific experiences differed across countries, public opinion almost everywhere eventually reinforced the trend against inflationary policies.",2007-05-16,HAWKISH,0.9650299549102783
"Economists and central bankers also devoted great attention to understanding the causes and consequences of inflation, providing the intellectual underpinning to policies oriented toward price stability.",2007-05-16,DOVISH,0.6189502477645874
"The fundamental forces I have described today--globalization, deregulation, financial innovation, and public understanding about the costs of inflation--provided the impetus for fighting inflation and opened the path for policies that enhance central bank credibility.",2007-05-16,HAWKISH,0.6597650647163391
"As the benefits of stable prices accrue and as financial markets deepen and become more sophisticated, the benefits of sound economic policies will help create support for institutional reforms that make returning to inflation harder--albeit not impossible--for future governments.",2007-05-16,HAWKISH,0.9547749757766724
Implications of Low Inflation for Bond Markets What are the implications of low inflation and low inflation volatility for interest rates and yield curves?,2007-05-16,NEUTRAL,0.9462460875511169
I believe that market confidence in continued low inflation has helped drive down the slope of the yield curve around the world by reducing the premium demanded for holding long-term nominal assets.,2007-05-16,HAWKISH,0.6640269756317139
"The taming of inflation also has extended bond maturities and yield curves further into the future than ever before, most notably in many emerging-market countries.",2007-05-16,HAWKISH,0.9825692176818848
"The current low level of long-term yields in the United States and other advanced economies is widely acknowledged as somewhat of a puzzle, or, as some have called it, a conundrum.9 Of course, flat and even inverted yield curves in advanced economies are nothing new--we know that the short end of the yield curve is dominated by monetary policy and cyclical factors.",2007-05-16,DOVISH,0.5202202200889587
"The forward rate reflects not only the market expectation of the future short-term interest rate but also a ""term premium"" to compensate for the risk of a commitment to extend credit so far in the future, including the risk of future inflation.",2007-05-16,DOVISH,0.9205169081687927
"Chairman Bernanke has suggested that an excess of ex ante global saving relative to global investment has held down real interest rates around the world.11 Some of the factors behind this excess of saving over investment include the surge in revenues of oil and commodity exporters, a retreat in Asian investment demand from the boom that preceded the late 1990s, and a reduction in fiscal deficits in some Latin American countries.",2007-05-16,NEUTRAL,0.935450553894043
"The declines in inflation rates, in the volatility of inflation, and in long-term inflation expectations all point to a reduction in the compensation required by investors for the effects of future inflation on the returns to holding long-term bonds.",2007-05-16,NEUTRAL,0.914994478225708
"This development is particularly remarkable in many emerging-market countries, in which longer-dated fixed-coupon bonds issued in domestic currencies had ceased to exist during the inflationary 1970s and 1980s.",2007-05-16,DOVISH,0.9469555616378784
"The recent lengthening of maturities of domestic-currency debt has, in many cases, not only extended the yield curve but--and this is one of the key results of the taming of inflation--effectively created a domestic-currency yield curve that previously did not exist.",2007-05-16,HAWKISH,0.9883790016174316
"Besides the fact that yield curves have been extended in many countries, they have also been relatively low and flat worldwide, at least in part because of the decline in inflation.",2007-05-16,NEUTRAL,0.9726817607879639
"Overall, the combination of lower and less volatile inflation worldwide has reduced inflation expectations and perceived inflation risk and resulted in a lower premium in long rates for inflation uncertainty.",2007-05-16,HAWKISH,0.681736409664154
The establishment of markets for long-term nominal government and corporate debt in countries in which they did not exist a decade ago is powerful evidence of the faith that investors place in a future environment of price stability.,2007-05-16,HAWKISH,0.8807990550994873
Broader Economic Benefits The economic benefits of price stability are too numerous and well known for me to cover here in detail.,2007-05-16,HAWKISH,0.7960302233695984
Long-run price stability certainly is essential for achieving maximum employment.,2007-05-16,HAWKISH,0.9656170606613159

A number of studies have concluded that the development of banking and financial markets is a key driver of economic growth.,2007-05-16,DOVISH,0.9682568907737732
"When emerging-market countries borrowed mostly in dollars or other foreign currency, they bore the exchange rate risk while lenders bore default risk.",2007-05-16,DOVISH,0.7884703874588013
This was a key reason why currency crises of the past few decades were so costly: Sharp depreciations of the exchange rate boosted the domestic-currency value of foreign debt and wreaked havoc with government finances and corporate balance sheets.,2007-05-16,DOVISH,0.5046085119247437
Higher and more-stable growth combined with a better ability to undertake long-term plans can also improve the fiscal outlook for a country.,2007-05-16,DOVISH,0.5304552316665649
"A better fiscal outlook, in turn, increases confidence, facilitates financial market development, and thus further boosts growth.",2007-05-16,DOVISH,0.5971397161483765

"More-prudent fiscal policies, including lower deficits, longer debt maturities, and reduced foreign-currency debt can reduce the likelihood and potential severity of financial crises.",2007-05-16,HAWKISH,0.6422197222709656
These policies make the financial positions of emerging-market governments less vulnerable to movements in interest rates and exchange rates.,2007-05-16,DOVISH,0.901850163936615
"Maintaining Progress I have argued that globalization, deregulation, and financial innovation, in part spurred by recent experiences of high inflation, have fostered currency competition that has led to improved central bank performance and, hence, the reduction of inflation worldwide.",2007-05-16,HAWKISH,0.5393608212471008

"Despite some recent turbulence, owing in part to geopolitical events, stock prices have logged robust gains over the past 3-1/2 years, and broad equity indices have now retraced most of the ground lost between 2000 and 2002.",2006-07-18,DOVISH,0.8117708563804626

"However, in this framework, the current period appears to be an outlier.4 That is, even after factoring in the current-cycle dynamics of strong profit growth and relatively modest investment, a good part of the rise in liquid assets remains unaccounted for--as much as one half of the total rise in cash-to-assets--according to Federal Reserve staff estimates.",2006-07-18,DOVISH,0.7868433594703674
"Business Caution As I discussed earlier, regression analysis suggests that the robust growth in profits and the comparatively modest recovery in capital expenditures leaves a good part of the extraordinary cash buildup unexplained.",2006-07-18,DOVISH,0.5042863488197327
"Although many periods of recovery are accompanied by concerns of economic growth and political turmoil, surveys in 2002 and 2003 suggested that business leaders were experiencing a more prolonged sense of gloom, with measures of sentiment dropping to low levels for as long two years beyond the trough in the business cycle.",2006-07-18,NEUTRAL,0.9650424122810364

"Indeed, I would argue that over the past eight years, the framework served us well and supported the Federal Reserve's efforts after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) first to achieve and then, for several years, to sustainâ€”until cut short this spring by the COVID-19 pandemicâ€”the operation of the economy at or close to both our statutorily assigned goals of maximum employment and price stability in what became the longest economic expansion in U.S. history.",2020-08-31,HAWKISH,0.9645127058029175
"Nonetheless, both the U.S. economyâ€”and, equally importantly, our understanding of the economyâ€”have clearly evolved along several crucial dimensions since 2012, and we believed that in 2019 it made sense to step back and assess whether, and in what possible ways, we might refine and rethink our strategy, tools, and communication practices to achieve and sustain our goals as consistently and robustly as possible in the global economy in which we operate today and for the foreseeable future.3 Perhaps the most significant change since 2012 in our understanding of the economy is our reassessment of the neutral real interest rate, r*, that, over the longer run, is consistent with our maximum-employment and price-stability mandates.",2020-08-31,DOVISH,0.9764707088470459
"In January 2012, the median FOMC participant projected a long-run r* of 2.25 percent, which, in tandem with the inflation goal of 2 percent, indicated a neutral setting for the federal funds rate of 4.25 percent.",2020-08-31,DOVISH,0.9575638771057129
"Moreover, as is well appreciated, the decline in neutral policy rates since the GFC is a global phenomenon that is widely expected by forecasters and financial markets to persist for years to come.5 The substantial decline in the neutral policy rate since 2012 has critical implications for the design, implementation, and communication of Federal Reserve monetary policy because it leaves the FOMC with less conventional policy space to cut rates to offset adverse shocks to aggregate demand.",2020-08-31,HAWKISH,0.8575156927108765
"With a diminished reservoir of conventional policy space, it is much more likely than was appreciated in 2012 that, in economic downturns, the effective lower bound (ELB) will constrain the ability of the FOMC to rely solely on the federal funds rate instrument to offset adverse shocks.6 This development, in turn, makes it more likely that recessions will impart elevated risks of more persistent downward pressure on inflation and upward pressure on unemployment that the Federal Reserve's monetary policy should, in design and implementation, seek to offset throughout the business cycle and not just in downturns themselves.7 Two other, related developments that have also become more evident than they appeared in 2012 are that price inflation seems less responsive to resource slack, and also, that estimates of resource slack based on historically estimated price Phillips curve relationships are less reliable and subject to more material revision than was once commonly believed.8 For example, in the face of declining unemployment rates that did not result in excessive cost-push pressure to price inflation, the median of the Committee's projections of u*â€”the rate of unemployment consistent in the longer run with the 2 percent inflation objectiveâ€”has been repeatedly revised lower, from 5.5 percent in January 2012 to 4.1 percent as of the June 2020 SEP.9 Projections of u* by the Congressional Budget Office and professional forecasters show a similar decline during this same period and for the same reason.10 In the past several years of the previous expansion, declines in the unemployment rate occurred in tandem with a notable and, to me, welcome increase in real wages that was accompanied by an increase in labor's share of national income, but not a surge in price inflation to a pace inconsistent with our price-stability mandate and well-anchored inflation expectations.",2020-08-31,NEUTRAL,0.9241041541099548
"Indeed, this pattern of mid-cycle declines in unemployment coincident with noninflationary increases in real wages has been evident in the U.S. data since the 1990s.11 With regard to inflation expectations, there is broad agreement among academics and policymakers that achieving price stability on a sustainable basis requires that inflation expectations be well anchored at the rate of inflation consistent with the price-stability goal.",2020-08-31,HAWKISH,0.9771137833595276
"This is especially true in the world that prevails today, with flat Phillips curves in which the primary determinant of actual inflation is expected inflation.12 The pre-GFC academic literature derived the important result that a credible inflation-targeting monetary policy strategy that is not constrained by the ELB can deliver, under rational expectations, inflation expectations that themselves are well anchored at the inflation target.13 In other words, absent a binding ELB constraint, a policy that targets actual inflation in these models delivers long-run inflation expectations well anchored at the target ""for free.""",2020-08-31,DOVISH,0.8770509362220764
"But this ""copacetic coincidence"" no longer holds in a world of low r* in which adverse aggregate demand shocks are expected to drive the economy in at least some downturns to the ELB.",2020-08-31,NEUTRAL,0.9591193199157715
"In this case, which is obviously relevant today, economic analysis indicates that flexible inflation-targeting monetary policy cannot be relied on to deliver inflation expectations that are anchored at the target, but instead will tend to deliver inflation expectations that, in each business cycle, become anchored at a level below the target.14 This is the crucial insight in my colleague John Williams' research with Thomas Mertens.",2020-08-31,HAWKISH,0.9708328247070312
"Indeed John's research over the past 20 years on r* estimation and monetary policy design at the ELB have been enormously influential, not only in the profession but also at Fed and certainly in my own thinking about how our framework should evolve.",2020-08-31,DOVISH,0.9476317763328552
This downward bias in inflation expectations under inflation targeting in an ELB world can in turn reduce already scarce policy spaceâ€”because nominal interest rates reflect both real rates and expected inflationâ€”and it can open up the risk of the downward spiral in both actual and expected inflation that has been observed in some other major economies.,2020-08-31,HAWKISH,0.7397944331169128

"A collection of the staff memos prepared for the review is now available on the Board's website.18 A New Economic Landscape Compels a Framework ReThink As I mentioned earlier, the Committee devoted five consecutive FOMC meetings between July 2019 and January 2020 to presentations by the staff and Committee discussions of memos touching on various aspects of the framework review, and it held a lengthy discussion at the July 2020 FOMC meeting about the new Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.19 While it is fair to say that these Committee discussions revealed among the 17 participants a healthy range of views about and priorities for refining our framework and strategy, some common themes did emerge, and these provided the foundation for the revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that the Committee discussed in July, approved last week, and released on Thursday, August 27.",2020-08-31,DOVISH,0.9697931408882141
"Broadly, we agreed that the economic landscape has changed in important ways since 2012 and that, as a result, the existing statement and the monetary policy strategy that flows from it need as well to evolve along several dimensions.20 For example, under our previous flexible inflation-targeting framework, the Federal Reserve declared that the 2 percent inflation objective is ""symmetric.""",2020-08-31,DOVISH,0.7371723651885986
"This term has been interpreted by many observers to mean that the Committee's reaction function aimed to be symmetric on either side of the 2 percent inflation goal, and that the FOMC set policy with the (ex ante) aim that the 2 percent goal should represent an inflation ceiling in economic expansions following economic downturns in which inflation falls below target.",2020-08-31,HAWKISH,0.8161100149154663

"Regarding the maximum-employment leg of the dual mandate, the previous statement's discussion of minimizing ""deviations"" of employment from its maximum level does not adequately reflect how the FOMC has actually conducted monetary policy in recent yearsâ€”before the pandemicâ€”as the actual unemployment rate was declining and, for several years, remained below SEP median projections of u* (although, to be sure, the earlier statement did acknowledge that it can be difficult to estimate the maximum level of employment with precision).21 The New Statement and Strategy Before discussing how our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy has evolved, let me highlight some important elements that remain unchanged.",2020-08-31,HAWKISH,0.6690040230751038

"Hence, we continue not to specify a numerical goal for our employment objective as we do for inflation.",2020-08-31,DOVISH,0.7618733644485474
"Third, we continue to state that an inflation rate of 2 percent over the longer run is most consistent with our mandate to promote both maximum employment and price stability.",2020-08-31,HAWKISH,0.7691943049430847
"Finally, because the effect of monetary policy on the economy operates with a lag, our strategy remains forward looking.",2020-08-31,DOVISH,0.7994274497032166
"With respect to the new framework itself, the statement now notes that the neutral level of the federal funds rate has declined relative to its historical average and therefore that the policy rate is more likely than in the past to be constrained by its ELB, and, moreover, that this binding ELB constraint is likely to impart downside risks to inflation and employment that the Committee needs to consider in implementing its monetary policy strategy.",2020-08-31,HAWKISH,0.991751492023468
"In this regard, the statement now highlights that the Committee is prepared to use its full range of tools to achieve its dual-mandate objectives.22 Regarding the maximum-employment mandate, the new statement now acknowledges that maximum employment is a ""broad-based and inclusive goal"" and continues to state that the FOMC considers a wide range of indicators to assess the level of maximum employment consistent with this broad-based goal.",2020-08-31,NEUTRAL,0.8054805397987366

"""23 This change conveys our judgment that a low unemployment rate by itself, in the absence of evidence that price inflation is running or is likely to run persistently above mandate-consistent levels or pressing financial stability concerns, will not, under our new framework, be a sufficient trigger for policy action.24 This is a robust evolution in the Federal Reserve's policy framework and, to me, reflects the reality that econometric models of maximum employment, while essential inputs to monetary policy, can be and have been wrong, and, moreover, that a decision to tighten monetary policy based solely on a model without any other evidence of excessive cost-push pressure that puts the price-stability mandate at risk is difficult to justify, given the significant cost to the economy if the model turns out to be wrong and given the ability of monetary policy to respond if the model were eventually to turn out to be right.25 With regard to the price-stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importanceâ€”and the challengeâ€”of keeping inflation expectations ""well anchored at 2 percent"" (and not just ""well anchored"") in a world of low r* and an ELB constraint that is binding in downturns.26 To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at 2 percent, it ""seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,"" andâ€”in the same sentenceâ€”that therefore ""following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.""",2020-08-31,HAWKISH,0.9637819528579712

"2 Similarly, asset prices also affect business balance sheets.",2005-01-12,DOVISH,0.9692073464393616

We economists have made some important strides in our understanding of inflation dynamics in recent years.,2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.8029829859733582
"Today, I will outline what I see as the key stylized facts that research has in recent years uncovered about changes in the dynamics of inflation and will present my view of how to interpret these findings.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.8826577663421631
The interpretation has important implications for how we should think about the conduct of monetary policy and what we think might happen to inflation over the next couple of years.,2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.9670044779777527
"The Empirical Evidence on Changes in Inflation Dynamics To see what research has discovered about the evolution of inflation dynamics in recent years, letâ€™s explore the following questions: (1) What is the available evidence on changes in inflation persistence in recent years?",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.9619070887565613
(3) What role do other variables play in the inflation process?,2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.9173129796981812
"Inflation Persistence To answer the first question, we need to measure how long the effects of a shock to inflation will last.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.7348393201828003
"Specifically, we need to know whether inflation tends to revert quickly to its initial level, or whether the effects of the shock persist--that is, lead to a changed level of inflation for an extended period.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.8994941711425781
The most obvious way of measuring inflation persistence is to regress inflation on several of its own lags and then calculate the sum of the coefficients on lagged inflation.,2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.8976675271987915
"If the sum of the coefficients is close to 1.0, then shocks to inflation have long-lived effects on inflation.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.6621975302696228
"In other words, inflation behaves like a random walk, so that when inflation goes up, it stays up.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.9401530623435974
"If the sum of the coefficients drops well below 1.0, then a shock to inflation has only a temporary effect on inflation, and inflation soon reverts back to its trend level.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.8569514751434326
The evidence from these so-called autoregressions with U.S. data suggests that inflation may have grown less persistent over time.,2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.5814546942710876
"Figure 1 illustrates this tendency, with the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index as the measure of inflation.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.7818214297294617
"Recent work by Jim Stock and Mark Watson (2007) provides an alternative and, to me, a quite intuitive way of thinking about inflation persistence.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.8160042762756348
They estimate a model that decomposes inflation into two components.,2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.8550795316696167
"The first component, which can be thought of as the underlying trend, follows a random walk, so that shocks to this component persist indefinitely and thus affect the trend inflation rate going forward.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.9741782546043396
"When the relative importance of the trend shocks became high, as it did in the 1970s and early 1980s, inflation became highly persistent.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.9217439293861389
"Under such conditions, if inflation went up, the trend component typically rose in tandem so that inflation stayed up.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.9152752757072449
"In contrast, when the temporary shocks were relatively more important, as was true before the 1970s and after the mid-1980s, a change in inflation tended to reflect a change in the temporary component, not the trend.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.973699152469635
"As a result, fluctuations in inflation tended to fade away, implying that inflation persistence was much lower.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.6152065992355347
"In the context of the Stock-Watson model, then, when inflation rose to double-digit levels during the ""Great Inflation"" period of the 1970s and early 1980s, persistence became very high because the trend rate of inflation moved around a lot--that is, trend inflation became unanchored.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.7229277491569519
"For example, Cecchetti et al (2007) employ a slightly modified version of the Stock-Watson procedure in a recent paper and find that inflation persistence has fallen so low that their estimated trend for gross domestic product (GDP) price inflation has been almost perfectly flat at about 2.2 percent over the past few years.",2007-03-23,NEUTRAL,0.5145772695541382
"Finally, follow-up work by staff members at the Federal Reserve Board suggests that the degree of persistence found with these techniques varies across different measures of inflation.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.8656635880470276
"Nonetheless, I think it fair to say that inflation has become less persistent over the past two decades but that the underlying trend may not yet be perfectly stable.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.9426929354667664
"In short, all these countries experienced a similar ""Great Inflation,"" when trend inflation became unanchored.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.7294173240661621
"Germany and Japan had shorter periods of high persistence of inflation, with persistence beginning to decline around 1969 in Germany and around 1979 in Japan.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.9738634824752808
Cecchetti and his co-authors conclude that the rise and subsequent decline of inflation persistence has thus been a worldwide phenomenon.,2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.9518066644668579
"Slope of the Phillips Curve In traditional Phillips-curve equations, inflation depends on past values of inflation, an unemployment gap (the difference between the unemployment rate and an estimate of its natural rate), and variables such as the relative price of energy and import prices.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.9816170930862427
"When researchers estimate these equations, they typically find that the coefficient on the unemployment gap has declined (in absolute value) since the 1980s, often by a marked amount.4 In other words, the evidence suggests that the Phillips curve has flattened.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.6266803741455078
"The finding that inflation is less responsive to the unemployment gap, if taken at face value, suggests that fluctuations in resource utilization will have smaller implications for inflation than used to be the case.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.9447932839393616
"From the point of view of policymakers, this development is a two-edged sword: On the plus side, it implies that an overheating economy will tend to generate a smaller increase in inflation.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.9744714498519897
"On the negative side, however, a flatter Phillips curve also implies that a given increase in inflation will be more costly to wring out of the system.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.9855674505233765
We can quantify this latter consideration using the so-called sacrifice ratio--the number of years that unemployment has to be 1.0 percentage point greater than its natural rate to reduce the inflation rate 1.0 percentage point.,2007-03-23,NEUTRAL,0.4147874414920807
"Averaging estimates obtained from a comprehensive battery of equation specifications suggests that the sacrifice ratio may be 40 percent larger--that is, it may be 40 percent more costly to reduce inflation than it was two decades ago.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.9857519268989563
Role of Other Variables in the Inflation Process Empirical evidence suggests that inflation has also become less responsive to other shocks.,2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.49604082107543945
"The two oil price shocks in the 1970s were associated with large jumps in core inflation, whereas recent surges in energy prices have not had a similar effect.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.7565523386001587
This reduced sensitivity manifests itself in traditional Phillips-curve models as a substantial decline in the estimated coefficient on the energy price term in these equations.,2007-03-23,NEUTRAL,0.9443392157554626
"Because this term equals the change in relative energy prices multiplied by the share of energy in aggregate output, energy price effects on inflation appear to have fallen by more than can be accounted for by the greater energy efficiency of the economy.5 In contrast, unpublished empirical work by the staff at the Federal Reserve Board suggests that, once we take the rising share of imports into account, the influence of import prices on core inflation in the United States has not changed much in the context of reduced-form forecasting models.6 At the same time, the influence of exchange rate movements on import prices--the so-called pass-through effect--may have fallen substantially, at least according to some studies.7 If so, then the influence of exchange rate fluctuations on domestic inflation may now be less than it once was, when one controls for changes in the volume of our foreign trade.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.9894394278526306
What Interpretation Can We Give to Changes in Inflation Dynamics?,2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.8568640947341919
"In interpreting these stylized facts about changes in inflation dynamics, we must first recognize that all of them are based on reduced-form relationships, and thus they are about correlations and not necessarily about true structural relationships.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.7834916710853577
"Because the explanatory variables in inflation regressions are themselves influenced by changes in economic conditions, changes in the underlying monetary policy regime are likely to be a source of changes in reduced-form inflation dynamics.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.977306067943573
"In such cases, we cannot use the reduced-form equations to disentangle the effects of such unobserved factors--which themselves may be driven by changes in monetary policy--from that of other influences.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.9296683669090271
Theory tells us that inflation expectations must be a key driving force behind inflation.,2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.6889851689338684
"This dependence has long been implicit in traditional Phillips-curve analysis, but expectations--now in explicit form--are also a central feature of the increasingly popular New Keynesian Phillips curves, in which current-period inflation is a function of expectations of next periodâ€™s inflation and resource utilization.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.9805701375007629
"Therefore, a natural first place to look for explanations of changing inflation dynamics is a possible change in the expectations-formation process.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.904555082321167
"The first stylized fact discussed earlier is that inflation persistence, which rose in the 1970s during the Great Inflation, has since declined to a much lower level.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.4995932877063751
"An intuitive way of thinking about this rise and fall in inflation persistence is that it resulted from an un-anchoring of trend inflation during the period of the Great Inflation, and a re-anchoring in recent years, as the work of Stock and Watson suggests.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.9781086444854736
"When we think about what drives trend inflation, inflation expectations--particularly long-run expectations--come to mind.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.8442959785461426
"A de-anchoring of inflation expectations would surely lead to trend inflation becoming unanchored, whereas an anchoring of inflation expectations at a particular level would necessarily lead to a stabilization of trend inflation and hence a decline in inflation persistence.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.9372632503509521
Do indicators of inflation expectations support this story?,2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.801541805267334
Consider the measure of expected inflation for the coming twelve months reported by the Livingston survey.,2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.8718114495277405
"As illustrated by the dashed line in figure 3 , this measure of expected short-run inflation--adjusted by a constant factor to convert it from a CPI basis to a PCE basis--soared during the 1970s and then fell back markedly during the 1980s and early 1990s.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.9780206084251404
"Over the past few years, the short-run series has fluctuated around 2 percent, with its month-to-month movements correlated with swings in energy prices, as one might expect.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.9309970140457153
"An even more striking story is told by the survey-based measure of expected long-run inflation used in the FRB/US model, the dotted blue line in figure 3.8 When we look at this long-run series (which should be more closely related to expectations about policy objectives than the short-run measure), we see that the publicâ€™s expectations stood at a high level of 7-3/4 percent at the start of the 1980s, when this information first began to be collected.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.9416808485984802
Estimates of inflation compensation derived from indexed Treasury yields have also been remarkably stable in recent years.,2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.9496073126792908
Figure 3 also reproduces the estimate of trend inflation produced by the Stock-Watson procedure (the solid line).,2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.8263788223266602
"As you can see, this series more or less tracks the survey-based measures of long-run expectations, suggesting that the anchoring of long-run inflation expectations in recent years may explain the finding of a marked decline in inflation persistence.",2007-03-23,NEUTRAL,0.43941712379455566
Anchoring of inflation expectations is not a deus ex machina.,2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.7486866116523743
"It must come from somewhere, and since Milton Friedmanâ€™s adage that â€œ[i]nflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenonâ€ is still true, monetary policy must be the source of the change in the evolution of long-run inflation expectations.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.9552678465843201
"During the 1960s and 1970s, the Federal Reserve and a number of other central banks maintained a policy stance that, inadvertently or not, was too easy on average and that allowed both actual and expected inflation to drift up markedly over many years.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.7211341857910156
"Since the late 1970s, however, the Federal Reserve and many other central banks have increased their commitment to price stability, in both words and actions.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.9780097603797913
"The Fed pursued preemptive strikes against rises in inflation in 1994-95, 1999-00, and in 2004-06, as well as preemptive strikes against potentially deflationary forces in the fall of 1998 and in 2001-04.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.8269134163856506
"The result has been not only low and stable inflation but also, as we have seen, a strong anchoring of long-run inflation expectations.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.9733471274375916
The pursuit of more-aggressive monetary policy to control inflation and the achievement of anchored inflation expectations can also help explain the other stylized facts about inflation dynamics.,2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.9828292727470398
"With expectations of inflation anchored, any given shock to inflation--whether it is from aggregate demand, energy prices, or the foreign exchange rate--will have a smaller effect on expected inflation and hence on trend inflation.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.5416821837425232
These shocks will then have a much less persistent effect on actual inflation.,2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.797199547290802
The recent experience with surging oil prices seems consistent with this story.,2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.8276772499084473
The price of West Texas intermediate crude oil rose from about $30 per barrel in late 2003 to a peak of almost $75 per barrel in July of last year.,2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.5340138673782349
"During this episode, inflation appears to have been boosted only temporarily and by a strikingly small amount, in contrast to the 1970s when oil price shocks led to large, persistent increases in inflation.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.5718750953674316
"Interestingly, monetary policy could have worked to flatten the estimated Phillips curve even without these favorable expectational effects, simply by moving more aggressively to stabilize both inflation and output.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.9490877389907837
"Thus, a monetary policy that more successfully stabilizes inflation and resource utilization could well lead to a smaller estimated coefficient on unemployment gaps in a traditional Phillips-curve equation.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.5933827757835388
"In particular, their analyses suggest that changes in the way the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy--including changes in both the parameters of monetary policy reaction functions and the volatility of shocks to those functions--may account for most of the reduction in the coefficients on resource utilization in traditional Phillips curves.9 What is particularly attractive about highlighting a better anchoring of inflation expectations as probably the primary factor driving the changes in inflation dynamics is that this one explanation covers so many of the stylized facts--an application of Occamâ€™s razor.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.6666581630706787
"Indeed, I have always become more confident in a theory if it can explain a number of very different facts.10 This is why I am so attracted to the view that inflation expectations are a key driving factor in the inflation process.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.854195237159729
"Of course, many other factors also influence inflation, and some of these provide other possible explanations for the recent changes in inflation dynamics.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.9299723505973816
"For example, smaller coefficients on unemployment gaps and energy prices in traditional Phillips curve equations may reflect the influence of lower and less-variable inflation on the frequency with which firms change their prices.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.48004841804504395
"In the context of a low-inflation environment, firms may have concluded that they can leave their prices fixed for longer periods at little cost, causing inflation to be less responsive to shocks, particularly if they are transitory.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.9149824976921082
"In this way, monetary policy may have affected the slope of the Phillips curve without having affected the manner in which expectations are formed.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.9349792003631592
"Also, from the mid-1980s through the first years of this decade, energy price movements were smaller and more transitory.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.9647916555404663
"We see this in futures markets, in which oil prices in far-dated futures contracts moved much less than spot prices over this period, suggesting that people expected a quick reversal in any rise in oil prices.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.8126080632209778
Such transitory shocks to energy price would presumably have a smaller effect on inflation than the more-persistent oil price shocks of the 1970s and early 1980s.,2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.9454972147941589
"Increased globalization and other sources of increased competition may also have lowered the sensitivity of domestic inflation to aggregate demand, thereby flattening the Phillips curve.",2007-03-23,NEUTRAL,0.8434412479400635

"If we take these facts to be structural and attributable to factors other than monetary policy, we might interpret them as suggesting that the Federal Reserve could respond less to shocks and yet be confident that inflation would remain at a low level.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.7919051051139832
"In addition, the smaller coefficient on unemployment gaps in traditional Phillips-curve models, which seems to imply that the sacrifice ratio has gone up, might lead us to think that reducing inflation is very costly because it requires long periods of high unemployment.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.9576101899147034
"As a result, policymakers might decide that such an attempt would not be worthwhile and so would be less likely to try to reduce inflation if it were undesirably high.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.9600486159324646
"If used in model simulation exercises, the flatter Phillips curve might also suggest that getting inflation down to a particular desired level could take an inordinately long time.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.9819498658180237
"However, if we instead attribute the observed changes in inflation dynamics to better monetary policy and a resultant better anchoring of inflation expectations, then such policy conclusions are unwarranted.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.6805692911148071
"Under this alternative interpretation, the reason that inflation has become less persistent is that monetary policy, in carrying out its dual mandate of promoting both price stability and maximum sustainable employment, has been vigilant in maintaining a low rate of inflation on average.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.9858749508857727
"But if the monetary authorities were to become complacent and to think that they could get away with not reacting to shocks that, in their mistaken view, no longer have the potential to cause inflation to rise persistently, then inflation expectations would surely become unhinged again.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.9365626573562622
"In short, complacency that might arise from the current low inflation persistence might result in deja vu all over again and return us to an era like the Great Inflation.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.9628658890724182
"These are exactly the concerns expressed in Tom Sargentâ€™s (2000) book on the rise and fall of U.S. inflation, in which he worries that a misunderstanding of the inflation process might again lead to a high-inflation equilibrium.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.9596076607704163
"If inflation has indeed become less persistent because better monetary policy has anchored inflation expectations more solidly, the monetary authorities may find that they have less need to induce large swings in economic activity to control inflation.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.5549871921539307
"If this hypothesis is correct, cyclical movements in interest rates need not be as great as was necessary when expectations were unanchored.",2007-03-23,DOVISH,0.9479010701179504

"My view--that recent changes in inflation dynamics result primarily from better-anchored inflation expectations and not from structural change or simply the achievement of a persistent low rate of inflation--implies some very good news: Potentially inflationary shocks, like a sharp rise in energy prices, are less likely to spill over into expected and actual core inflation.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.9411715865135193

"On the other hand, as Christy and David Romer (2002) have pointed out, the Federal Reserve in the 1970s overestimated the cost of reducing inflation because estimates of sacrifice ratios by Arthur Okun and other economists at that time proved to be too high.12 As a historical note, this provides one explanation for the Federal Reserveâ€™s tolerance of such high inflation at the time.",2007-03-23,HAWKISH,0.8636817336082458

Productivity Growth and Cost Reductions So how did this confluence of positive events come about?,2001-06-14,DOVISH,0.5585768222808838

Research by Federal Reserve Board economists Steve Oliner and Dan Sichel sheds some light on the sources of this faster productivity growth.,2001-06-14,DOVISH,0.6493096351623535
The high (and rising) levels of business investment raised the amount of capital per worker and thereby boosted productivity.,2001-06-14,HAWKISH,0.7416270971298218
"About 1/2 percentage point of the increase in productivity growth over the 1995-99 period can be attributed to this so-called ""capital deepening,"" most of which reflected greater spending by businesses on computers, software, and communications equipment.",2001-06-14,DOVISH,0.7102444171905518
Oliner and Sichel estimate that the consolidated influences of information technology investments account for about two-thirds of the acceleration in productivity since 1995.,2001-06-14,DOVISH,0.8535208702087402

The latest research suggests that the demand for computers is quite sensitive to movements in the cost of capital.,2001-06-14,DOVISH,0.963692307472229

"All else equal, the likely presence of a liquidity premium in the TIPS return tends to make breakeven inflation an underestimate of expected inflation, thus offsetting to some degree the effect of the inflation risk premium.3 Like inflation risk premiums, liquidity premiums on TIPS appear to vary over time, further complicating the interpretation of breakeven inflation.",2004-04-15,DOVISH,0.9621700048446655
"Hence, an indexed security typically has a longer duration with respect to real interest rate changes than does the nominal security, a difference that affects the relative riskiness of real and nominal securities.4 More generally, because TIPS returns are imperfectly correlated with the yields on both nominal Treasuries and stocks, some investors demand TIPS for general diversification purposes--a demand that appears to have increased significantly as investors have become more familiar with this new type of asset.",2004-04-15,DOVISH,0.9731125831604004
"As the supply of TIPS has been fairly limited, the rise in demand by institutional investors and others may push down the equilibrium real return on TIPS and thus raise measures of breakeven inflation.5 A separate issue that bears on the relevance of breakeven inflation for policymaking is that TIPS returns depend on the overall consumer price index (CPI), whereas for many purposes policymakers are more interested in the behavior of core inflation, a measure of inflation that strips out volatile food and energy prices.",2004-04-15,HAWKISH,0.978954017162323

The fact that the volatility of breakeven inflation is so much greater than that of standard survey measures of inflation expectations (such as those collected by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia for professional forecasters or by the University of Michigan for consumers) should give us pause.,2004-04-15,DOVISH,0.5983673930168152
"The responsiveness of breakeven inflation to what might be construed primarily as liquidity disturbances, such as the Russian debt crisis and recent bouts of mortgage hedging activity that roiled Treasury markets, suggests that variable liquidity premiums, together with varying inflation risk premiums, contaminate breakeven inflation as a measure of expected inflation.6 I have emphasized some reasons to be cautious in interpreting breakeven inflation as expected inflation.",2004-04-15,DOVISH,0.9859325289726257

Interest Rates and Spreads as Leading Indicators An alternative approach to extracting information from financial markets is to examine a range of asset prices and yields to determine whether they are useful as leading indicators of economic developments.,2004-04-15,DOVISH,0.9668754935264587

"At least since the 1930s, when Wesley Mitchell and Arthur Burns (1938) published their pioneering work, economists have noted the usefulness of asset prices in forecasting economic activity--though perhaps we should keep in mind Paul Samuelson's wry observation that ""the stock market has predicted nine of the last five recessions.""",2004-04-15,DOVISH,0.9803312420845032
"Although many financial quantities have been used in forecasting (an index of stock prices is included in the official index of leading indicators), interest rates on various financial instruments have perhaps been most often cited for their value as leading indicators.7 For example, in a 1992 paper, Alan Blinder and I found evidence that the federal funds rate, the short-term interest rate used by the Federal Reserve as its policy instrument, has significant predictive power for a variety of measures of economic activity.",2004-04-15,DOVISH,0.9835688471794128
"Among these variables were the spread between the ten-year and one-year Treasury yields (the term spread), the yield differential between commercial paper and Treasury bills (the public-private spread), the change in the ten-year Treasury yields, and the nominal exchange rate.8 Thus, Stock and Watson found that two of the best seven macroeconomic forecasting variables were interest rate spreads, and four of the best seven forecasters were financial in nature.",2004-04-15,DOVISH,0.9835017323493958

"Evidence for the predictive power of the slope of the yield curve has been found for other industrialized countries as well as for the United States.9 Although the evident information content of the term spread and other yields and spreads is intriguing, these variables--like breakeven inflation--hardly provide a foolproof forecasting tool.",2004-04-15,DOVISH,0.9774600267410278

"Classical economic theory holds that the economy's equilibrium real interest rate is determined by the interaction of ""productivity"" and ""thrift.""",2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.9762494564056396
"That is, the equilibrium real interest rate at full employment has to balance saving (driven by the thrift motive) and investment (responding to the productivity and, hence, profitability of capital).",2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.8868892192840576
"Higher productivity growth increases the profitability of investment, increasing the demand for investment, and, hence, the equilibrium real interest rate that balances saving and investment at full employment.",2000-04-12,HAWKISH,0.7690057158470154
This is really an implication of the earlier discussion of the effect of a productivity shock on aggregate demand relative to aggregate supply.,2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.8502639532089233
"A variety of models suggest that, under reasonable assumptions, the increase in the equilibrium real interest rate is at least one-for-one with the pick-up in the economy's growth rate.",2000-04-12,HAWKISH,0.9636956453323364

The natural rate is the equilibrium real interest rate that I described above.,2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.9618401527404785
The market rate is the actual (real) interest rate determined in financial markets and affected by monetary policy as well as by the balance between saving and investment.,2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.9670288562774658
"When the market rate is below the natural rate, financial conditions are relatively stimulative and aggregate demand will be boosted to a level above potential aggregate supply.",2000-04-12,NEUTRAL,0.9847562909126282
This analysis makes clear that the effect of a productivity shock on the balance between aggregate demand and supply depends critically on the monetary policy that accompanies it.,2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.9677106142044067
"Of course, to keep market rates in line with the natural rate, we must make some judgments about the degree to which the equilibrium real interest rate is affected by an increase in productivity growth.",2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.8806951642036438
"This depends on, in addition to the size of the increment in productivity growth, a number of other considerations.",2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.9032202959060669
"For example, the change in the equilibrium real interest rate will also depend on the prevailing fiscal policy.",2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.955913782119751
"If nominal spending or even real government spending is fixed, on the other hand, a productivity shock increases the government budget surplus relative to GDP, at least partially offsetting the rise in the equilibrium real interest rate.",2000-04-12,HAWKISH,0.7032104730606079
The full effect on the equilibrium real interest rate holds when the productivity shock symmetrically affects foreign as well as domestic output growth.,2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.6522430777549744
"If the productivity shock raises the growth rate only or predominantly in the United States, the resulting international capital flows to the United States in search of higher expected rates of return will damp the effect of the productivity shock on our equilibrium real interest rate.",2000-04-12,NEUTRAL,0.6659458875656128
"As a result of the variety of effects on the equilibrium real interest rate in this episode, it takes some careful analysis to assess whether and how much the real equilibrium interest rate may have increased.",2000-04-12,HAWKISH,0.9168221354484558
"The observed strength of aggregate demand relative to aggregate supply, however, does importantly reinforce the judgment that the natural rate has indeed increased.",2000-04-12,HAWKISH,0.7003106474876404
Monetary Policy and Productivity Shocks The effect of a productivity shock on the balance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply (or equivalently on the balance between natural and market rates) depends importantly on the conduct of monetary policy.,2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.9788174033164978
"Therefore, whether inflation turns out to be higher, lower, or unchanged in response to the productivity shock--especially once the initial disinflationary impetus dissipates--depends on the conduct of monetary policy and should not be attributed to the productivity shock itself.",2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.9761269092559814
"In simulations with the FRB-US model, for example, aggregate demand increases faster than aggregate supply if the nominal federal funds rate is held constant or if monetary policy is assumed to follow a Taylor Rule and when households and firms are assumed to fairly quickly recognize the sharp step-up in productivity growth.",2000-04-12,HAWKISH,0.7624914646148682
The Taylor rule prescribes adjustments in the real federal funds rate in response to deviations of output from potential and inflation from some target rate.,2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.9783242344856262
This formulation of policy yields something very close to an unchanged nominal funds rate path during the first couple of years following an increase in productivity growth.,2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.8711007833480835
The decline in inflation raises the real federal funds rate just about as much as the Taylor Rule prescribes in light of the increase in the output gap.,2000-04-12,HAWKISH,0.9800839424133301
"Later, however, as the disinflationary force of the productivity shock dissipates, the Taylor Rule will cause increases in nominal and real interest rates that push output toward potential and contain inflation.",2000-04-12,HAWKISH,0.9621142745018005
Monetary policy could use such a shock as an opportunity to temporarily move below the unemployment rate sustainable in the long run while keeping the inflation rate unchanged.,2000-04-12,NEUTRAL,0.9782091379165649
"Alternatively, monetary policy could convert the temporary disinflationary effect into a permanent one.",2000-04-12,HAWKISH,0.9570099711418152
"This would be an example of ""opportunistic disinflation"": monetary policy could take advantage of a disinflationary surprise to lower inflation without a temporary increase in the unemployment rate.",2000-04-12,NEUTRAL,0.7447980642318726
"If inflation is low at the time of the shock, the incentive is great to take the benefits in a temporary decline in the unemployment rate.",2000-04-12,NEUTRAL,0.9516527652740479
"Of course, policymakers could also choose a bit of both of these options, and I would interpret monetary policy as having produced this middle course during the last several years.",2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.9597320556640625
The task of monetary policy going forward is to avoid transforming what could have been an opportunity to lower the underlying inflation rate into a balance of risks that threatens to raise inflation relative to the rate prevailing at the beginning of this episode.,2000-04-12,HAWKISH,0.9879617094993591
Is Monetary Policy Less Effective Today?,2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.5165883898735046
"The recent increases in the federal funds rate do not appear, to date, to have slowed the momentum in demand growth.",2000-04-12,HAWKISH,0.8600050806999207
"Indeed, as I noted earlier, the economy appears to have shifted into a still higher gear just as monetary policy turned more restrictive.",2000-04-12,HAWKISH,0.9758727550506592
"As a result, some have wondered whether recent structural changes may have undermined the effectiveness of monetary policy.",2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.9631754755973816
It is well appreciated that monetary policy affects aggregate demand with long and variable lags.,2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.9391759634017944
"So, a limited initial effect of tighter monetary policy on demand is to be expected.",2000-04-12,HAWKISH,0.6509445309638977
"In addition, the first three quarter-point moves simply reversed the earlier cumulative easing, which may have added to demand in the second half of 1999.",2000-04-12,HAWKISH,0.911529004573822
"So the modest effects on aggregate demand to date perhaps only confirm the relatively modest and extremely gradual nature of the current tightening, along with the usual lags.",2000-04-12,HAWKISH,0.9761970639228821
"In addition, some developments suggest that the recent policy moves may have had a more limited effect on aggregate demand than would have been expected from even this modest increase in the federal funds rate.",2000-04-12,HAWKISH,0.8742470145225525
The key to understanding the effects of monetary policy on aggregate demand is that monetary policy does not operate through the direct effect of the federal funds rate on aggregate demand.,2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.9470294713973999
"Instead, changes in the federal funds rate and anticipations of future movements in the funds rate affect aggregate demand via their influence on a broader range of financial conditions, including short and longer-term private interest rates, equity prices, and the real exchange rate.",2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.9855102300643921
"Financial conditions indexes that capture in one measure the full range of relevant interest rates, asset prices, and exchange rates have been constructed by Goldman Sachs and Macroeconomic Advisers.",2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.9600850939750671
"So a second conclusion about the current experience is that the increase in the funds rate, to date, has had a smaller effect than usual--nearly zero--on overall financial conditions and hence on aggregate demand.",2000-04-12,HAWKISH,0.5347177982330322
"The apparent persistence of accommodative overall financial conditions in the face of the recent increases in the federal funds rate is principally due to the continued increase, on balance, of equity prices and the failure of the real exchange rate to appreciate further.",2000-04-12,NEUTRAL,0.9776493906974792
"Figure 3 confirms that equity prices have been unusually resilient in this episode, rising by an amount near the maximum during the first nine months of significant tightenings over the period studied.",2000-04-12,HAWKISH,0.9669303297996521
Private long-term interest rates will rise further only if market participants come to believe that the Federal Reserve will tighten by more than the couple of additional moves already embedded in the yield curve or if inflation expectations begin to rise.,2000-04-12,HAWKISH,0.9561827778816223
"The fact that long-term private rates had already risen in anticipation of further Fed tightening has shortened the lag from increases in the federal funds rate to the ultimate effect on aggregate demand relative to past experience and thereby has actually added to, rather than subtracted from, the effectiveness of monetary policy.",2000-04-12,HAWKISH,0.9753198623657227
"No one channel of monetary policy--in terms of the financial conditions index, no one component--should be singled out as of controlling importance.",2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.9019495844841003
"Still, monetary policy must take into account the overall response of financial conditions in judging the appropriate magnitude of any cumulative change in the federal funds rate.",2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.9030585289001465
"There also has been concern that some sectors of the economy--specifically investment in high-tech equipment, a component that has been an important contributor to the strength of aggregate demand--may be relatively insensitive to higher interest rates, therefore reducing the overall response to higher interest rates in this episode of policy tightening.",2000-04-12,HAWKISH,0.9812721610069275
"The housing sector has often borne a disproportionate burden of higher interest rates, at least initially.",2000-04-12,HAWKISH,0.9575586318969727
But the reality is that monetary policy always has had uneven effects across the economy.,2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.9574028849601746
"We have a single instrument that, by necessity, must be used to achieve balance between aggregate demand and potential aggregate supply.",2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.7450147271156311
Variations in sectoral responses will be unavoidable given the different lags and different interest sensitivities of the various components of aggregate demand.,2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.8596873879432678
"Another often-asked question about monetary policy is whether, once a decision is made to correct emerging imbalances, policy should move gradually or more forcefully.",2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.7829697728157043
"But when considerable uncertainty remains about the appropriate course and aggressiveness of the policy response--especially when policy is moving pre-emptively against the threat of higher inflation, without any direct corroboration from data on inflation--a more gradualist approach allows policymakers to assess the data along the way and adjust accordingly the desired path of interest rates.",2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.5719855427742004
The risk in this approach is that imbalances become larger and more disruptive to correct if resource utilization tightens further or inflation expectations pick up.,2000-04-12,HAWKISH,0.9849549531936646
The appropriate speed of adjustment might also depend on the degree to which the bond markets reflect policymakers' expectations about likely further increases in short-term interest rates.,2000-04-12,HAWKISH,0.9156203866004944
"That is, it may be more appropriate to move short-term interest rates slowly when long-term interest rates have already adjusted by an amount that policymakers believe is sufficient to achieve their objectives.",2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.560614287853241
Conclusion The combination of favorable relative-price and productivity shocks in this expansion are the principal sources of the exceptional combination of robust output growth and declining unemployment on the one hand and stable to declining inflation on the other hand.,2000-04-12,HAWKISH,0.8176909685134888
"As the disinflationary effects of relative-price shocks and faster productivity growth dissipate, monetary policy must be prepared to deal with more traditional concerns about the balance between growth of demand and supply, the relationship between output and potential, and the danger of overheating.",2000-04-12,HAWKISH,0.727730929851532
"As these concerns have become more pressing, monetary policy has responded in an effort to rebalance aggregate demand and supply and contain the risk of higher inflation.",2000-04-12,HAWKISH,0.9893109798431396
A productivity shock is unambiguously good.,2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.7701901793479919
But the monetary policy that accompanies it can be good or bad.,2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.9728172421455383
"A good monetary policy is one that allows the economy to realize the full benefits of the higher growth while respecting the fact that limits--albeit new ones--remain and that, if exceeded, the ultimate result will be rising inflation, threatening the sustainability of the expansion.",2000-04-12,HAWKISH,0.9908815622329712
Monetary policy remains fully capable of getting the job done.,2000-04-12,DOVISH,0.7835105061531067
Policymakers have to adjust the timing and cumulative size of tightenings to ensure that the effect on overall financial conditions will promote a continuation of this economic expansion and an accompanying low and stable rate of inflation.,2000-04-12,HAWKISH,0.9869512319564819

What Are the Consequences of an Oil Price Spike?,2019-10-08,HAWKISH,0.7087442278862
Let's turn now to the first question of the consequences of an oil price spike.,2019-10-08,HAWKISH,0.7364768981933594
"Since then, remarkable advances in the technology for finding and extracting oil have led to a rapid increase in production to levels higher than ever before.3 In 2018, the United States became the world's largest oil producer.4 Oil exports have surged, imports have fallen (figure 2), and the U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that this month, for the first time in many decades, the United States will be a net exporter of oil.5 As monetary policymakers, we closely monitor developments in oil markets because disruptions in these markets have played a role in several U.S. recessions and in the Great Inflation of the 1960s and 1970s.",2019-10-08,DOVISH,0.6281551718711853
"Traditionally, we assessed that a sharp rise in the price of oil would have a strong negative effect on consumers and businesses and, hence, on the U.S. economy.",2019-10-08,HAWKISH,0.9589730501174927
"Today a higher oil price would still cause dislocations and hardship for many, but with exports and imports nearly balanced, the higher price paid by consumers is roughly offset by higher earnings of workers and firms in the U.S. oil industry.",2019-10-08,HAWKISH,0.7606849074363708
"Moreover, because it is now easier to ramp up oil production, a sustained price rise can quickly boost output, providing a shock absorber in the face of supply disruptions.",2019-10-08,HAWKISH,0.9594716429710388
"Thus, setting aside the effects of geopolitical uncertainty that may accompany higher oil prices, we now judge that a price spike would likely have nearly offsetting effects on U.S. gross domestic product (GDP).",2019-10-08,HAWKISH,0.9766178131103516
How Should We Measure Output and Productivity?,2019-10-08,DOVISH,0.8517659306526184

"Where others saw capacity constraints and incipient inflation, Greenspan saw a productivity boom that would leave room for very low unemployment without inflation pressures.",2019-10-08,DOVISH,0.822990894317627
"In light of the uncertainty it faced, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) judged that the appropriate riskâ€‘management approach called for refraining from interest rate increases unless and until there were clearer signs of rising inflation.",2019-10-08,DOVISH,0.49759700894355774
"Under this policy, unemployment fell near record lows without rising inflation, and later revisions to GDP measurement showed appreciably faster productivity growth.8 This episode illustrates a key challenge to making data-dependent policy in real time: Good decisions require good data, but the data in hand are seldom as good as we would like.",2019-10-08,DOVISH,0.8117455840110779
Productivity is again presenting a puzzle.,2019-10-08,DOVISH,0.6543013453483582
"Official statistics currently show productivity growth slowing significantly in recent years, with the growth in output per hour worked falling from more than 3 percent a year from 1995 to 2003 to less than half that pace since then.9 Analysts are actively debating three alternative explanations for this apparent slowdown: First, the slowdown may be real and may persist indefinitely as productivity growth returns to moreâ€‘normal levels after a brief golden age.10 Second, the slowdown may instead be a pause of the sort that often accompanies fundamental technological change, so that productivity gains from recent technology advances will appear over time as society adjusts.11 Third, the slowdown may be overstated, perhaps greatly, because of measurement issues akin to those at work in the 1990s.12 At this point, we cannot know which of these views may gain widespread acceptance, and monetary policy will play no significant role in how this puzzle is resolved.",2019-10-08,DOVISH,0.4919658899307251

"Researchers have tried to answer these questions in various ways.13 For example, Fed researchers have recently proposed a novel approach to measuring the value of services consumers derive from cellphones and other devices based on the volume of data flowing over those connections.14 Taking their accounting at face value, GDP growth would have been about 1/2 percentage point higher since 2007, which is an appreciable change and would be very good news.",2019-10-08,DOVISH,0.9596691131591797

Let me now turn from the measurement issues raised by the information age to an issue that has long been at the center of monetary policymaking: How tight is the labor market?,2019-10-08,HAWKISH,0.6462531089782715

"Several years ago, we began a collaboration with the payroll processing firm ADP to construct a measure of payroll employment from their data set, which covers about 20 percent of the nation's private workforce and is available to us with a roughly one-week delay.15 As described in a recent research paper, we constructed a measure that provides an independent read on payroll employment that complements the official statistics.16 While experience is still limited with the new measure, we find promising evidence that it can refine our real-time picture of job gains.",2019-10-08,DOVISH,0.9654272794723511

"First, we survey the public and ask them what they expect the inflation rate to be in coming years.",2021-10-19,DOVISH,0.8901508450508118
"Second, we can infer inflation expectations from differences in yields between Treasury securities that are indexed for inflation and those that are not.",2021-10-19,DOVISH,0.946811318397522
"These breakeven inflation measures from the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities market are referred to as ""market based"" measures of inflation compensation.",2021-10-19,DOVISH,0.8440515398979187

"Presumably, this measure of expectations is important because it should influence households' wage demands as they seek compensation for an increasing cost of living.",2021-10-19,HAWKISH,0.5539315938949585
"This is why I have always preferred market-based measures of inflation expectations, because they are formed by investors who are betting with real money about future inflation.",2021-10-19,DOVISH,0.9103826284408569
This brings us to another question: Are inflation expectations anchored around our inflation target of 2 percent?,2021-10-19,DOVISH,0.5483236312866211
Survey measures have shown a dramatic increase in inflation expectations over the past few months.,2021-10-19,HAWKISH,0.9528952836990356

This is eye opening and a genuine cause for concern should households embed these expectations in wage demands.,2021-10-19,DOVISH,0.6542788147926331
"However, market-based measures of inflation expectations and the five-year inflation expectations from the New York Fed survey continue to be anchored near our 2 percent target.",2021-10-19,DOVISH,0.8260291218757629

"As a result, recent high inflation readings are transitory and not broad based.",2021-10-19,HAWKISH,0.8870325088500977

"There are sound reasons for this, such as when we exclude volatile food and energy prices to get a measure of ""core"" inflation; that kind of measure often is more stable and can tell us whether the underlying forces behind inflation are moving as rapidly as it might seem from headline inflation.",2021-10-19,DOVISH,0.8817230463027954

"Of course, the Phillips Curve framework has always been much easier to describe than to implement, given uncertainties about the estimates of NAIRU, given the fact that empirical regularities between inflation and unemployment always left much of the variation in inflation unexplained, and given the importance of supply shocks with significant, though transitory, effects on the inflation-unemployment nexus.",1997-09-17,DOVISH,0.9802205562591553

"First, in the absence of policy adjustment, is the economy slowing or likely to slow to trend quickly enough to stabilize the unemployment rate at its current level?",1996-09-08,NEUTRAL,0.9562095999717712
"Second, is the current unemployment already so low that remaining at this level would trigger a steady increase in the rate of inflation?",1996-09-08,HAWKISH,0.9466561675071716
All have growth near 2% in the second half of 1996 and through 1997.,1996-09-08,DOVISH,0.7475889921188354

I should note that growth itself does not cause inflation.,1996-09-08,DOVISH,0.9124675393104553

But the tension is there and we have to weigh the risk of higher inflation if the longer-run estimate of NAIRU proves correct against the potential that the recent stability in inflation reflects a change in structure that will persist.,1996-09-08,HAWKISH,0.9118445515632629

What then for monetary policy?,1996-09-08,DOVISH,0.8344822525978088
"There is, to be sure, no trade-off and hence no inconsistency between full employment and price stability in the long run.",1996-09-08,DOVISH,0.6246159076690674
"Therefore, maximum employment (at least if interpreted as full employment or being at NAIRU) and price stability, the statutory mandate of the Federal Reserve, are compatible in the long run.",1996-09-08,DOVISH,0.5124436020851135
Full employment can be achieved either with price stability or with positive stable inflation.,1996-09-08,DOVISH,0.8692665100097656
"So the mandate, in my interpretation, does dictate that we move to price stability, because this is only there that we can achieve both objectives simultaneously.",1996-09-08,HAWKISH,0.9848376512527466
"That still leaves us the strategic question of how to juggle the goals of full employment and price stability in the short run when the initial conditions do involve a conflict among the ultimate objectives--for example, the current combination of modest, stable inflation and full employment.",1996-09-08,DOVISH,0.937472939491272
It is desirable that monetary policy respond to this challenge in a systematic way.,1996-09-08,HAWKISH,0.840732753276825
This would allow the private sector to both anticipate where monetary policy is headed and retain confidence that the Federal Reserve remains focused on its long-run objective as it carries out its meeting-to-meeting policies.,1996-09-08,DOVISH,0.9025463461875916
The Taylor Rule is a simple example of a strategy that juggles the two objectives in a disciplined manner without losing sight of the long-run price stability objective.,1996-09-08,DOVISH,0.7106029987335205
The Taylor Rule varies the real federal funds rate relative to some equilibrium level in response to both the deviation of output from its full employment level and of inflation from its long-run target.,1996-09-08,DOVISH,0.9859764575958252
"This rule, in effect, worries continuously about both output relative to potential and inflation relative to price stability.",1996-09-08,DOVISH,0.7371228337287903
But the Taylor Rule helps illustrate some important aspects of monetary policy strategy.,1996-09-08,DOVISH,0.9152544140815735
"The Taylor Rule would resolve the near-term conflict between objectives in the current economic environment by encouraging some slack in the economy and thereby ensuring downward pressure on inflation over time, as long as inflation were above the long-run inflation target, while still balancing along the way both the inflation and employment objectives.",1996-09-08,HAWKISH,0.9540335536003113
"Opportunistic Disinflation A couple of years ago, I gave the name ""opportunistic disinflation"" to an alternative strategy for bridging between short-run policy and long-run goals, a strategy that I observed the Federal Reserve to be following at the time.",1996-09-08,DOVISH,0.39240676164627075
"Under this strategy, once inflation becomes modest, as today, Federal Reserve policy in the near term focuses on sustaining trend growth at full employment at the prevailing inflation rate.",1996-09-08,NEUTRAL,0.5312609076499939
At this point the short-run priorities are twofold: sustaining the expansion and preventing an acceleration of inflation.,1996-09-08,HAWKISH,0.9541587829589844
"This is, nevertheless, a strategy for disinflation because it takes advantage of the opportunity of inevitable recessions and potential positive supply shocks to ratchet down inflation over time.",1996-09-08,HAWKISH,0.9702023267745972
Proponents of this strategy sometimes describe this approach as reducing inflation cycle-to-cycle or describe the economy as being one recession from price stability.,1996-09-08,HAWKISH,0.9711317420005798
"Under this strategy, if growth were to slow to trend, the unemployment rate were to remain where it is, and inflation were to remain stable, monetary policy would remain on hold, ready to respond aggressively to any acceleration of inflation, but otherwise prepared to be patient and accept the lower inflation that will accompany the next recession or favorable supply shock.",1996-09-08,DOVISH,0.8638201951980591
So let me sum up how I look at the challenges facing monetary policy in the current economic environment and in light of the longer run strategic issues I have set out this evening.,1996-09-08,DOVISH,0.9099927544593811
"In the near term, I believe we should be vigilant to insure that the progress made to lower inflation to the current level is sustained.",1996-09-08,HAWKISH,0.9892833232879639
"I am, as a result, focused on forecasts of near-term growth relative to trend as a forward-looking indicator of changes in utilization rates, on utilization rates themselves as forward-looking indicators of inflation pressures, on labor costs as a key factor in the transmission of demand pressure to price inflation, and, given the uncertainty about NAIRU, on readings of the current inflation rate.",1996-09-08,DOVISH,0.982893168926239
"In that spirit, I will provide a brief progress report on the economic recovery, as well as some remarks on the evolution of monetary policy.",2004-01-04,DOVISH,0.9453093409538269
"Though officially the recession lasted only eight months, from March to November 2001, a period of economic underperformance began with the sharp decline in stock prices and business investment in mid-2000 and continued through the months leading up to the Iraq war this past spring.",2004-01-04,NEUTRAL,0.6979666948318481
"In an effort to restore profitability in an environment of weak demand and nonexistent pricing power, businesses also worked hard to improve efficiency and cut costs.",2004-01-04,NEUTRAL,0.9532794952392578
"These efforts have paid off in terms of remarkable increases in productivity, but, together with insufficient growth in aggregate demand, they also contributed to a significant decline in employment.",2004-01-04,NEUTRAL,0.9289957880973816
"Indeed, the lag between the recovery in output and the recovery in employment has been significantly greater this time than it was after the 1990-91 downturn.",2004-01-04,NEUTRAL,0.904418408870697
"Monetary policy was deployed to support the weakening economy, as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) aggressively cut rates in 2001 and has continued its policy of accommodation since then.",2004-01-04,NEUTRAL,0.9869092106819153
"As you know, the third quarter of the year displayed near-record levels of real economic growth, in the vicinity of 8 percent at an annual rate, and growth appears to have continued strong in the fourth quarter of 2003.",2004-01-04,HAWKISH,0.9621729850769043

"The positive case for maintaining an accommodative monetary policy at this stage of the recovery has three elements, some of which will be familiar to many of you, at least in broad outline.",2004-01-04,NEUTRAL,0.9815770983695984

"For example, the twelve-month inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index, current-methods basis and excluding food and energy prices, was 2.7 percent at the recession trough in November 2001.",2004-01-04,DOVISH,0.7611802816390991
This measure of core inflation fell to 2.0 percent as of November 2002 and to only 1.1 percent as of November 2003.,2004-01-04,NEUTRAL,0.688578188419342

"In contrast, in previous episodes of recovery, inflation was above the range consistent with price stability, so that a tightening of monetary policy at an earlier stage of the expansion represented the prudent response to inflation risks.",2004-01-04,HAWKISH,0.9914058446884155
"Because inflation is so low today, monetary policy can afford to be more patient to ensure that the recovery is self-sustaining.",2004-01-04,NEUTRAL,0.9484842419624329
The second unusual aspect of the current situation relevant for monetary policy is the truly remarkable increase in labor productivity that firms and workers have achieved in recent years.,2004-01-04,DOVISH,0.5846595168113708
"Those productivity increases affect the inflation outlook in two related ways: first, by raising potential output and thus (for given growth in aggregate demand) the size of the output gap; and, second, by reducing the costs of production, which puts downward pressure on prices.",2004-01-04,HAWKISH,0.7577112913131714
"I will first address the effect of productivity on costs, returning later to the link of productivity and the output gap.",2004-01-04,DOVISH,0.9325801730155945

"Recently, however, labor productivity has grown even more quickly than the costs of employing workers, with the result that unit labor costs have declined in each of the past three years.",2004-01-04,DOVISH,0.5284279584884644
"A decline in production costs must result in lower prices for final consumers, an increased price-cost markup for producers, or both.",2004-01-04,NEUTRAL,0.6942057609558105

"To the extent that product-market competition erodes these markups, as is likely to occur over time, downward pressure will be exerted on the inflation rate, even if, as is likely, the recent declines in unit labor cost do not persist.2 The third unusual factor is the persistent softness of the labor market.",2004-01-04,HAWKISH,0.6877328157424927

"Thus, for given growth in aggregate spending, a higher rate of productivity growth implies a slower rate of growth in employment.3 To summarize, then, the current economic situation has three unusual aspects, which together (in my view) rationalize the current stance of monetary policy.",2004-01-04,NEUTRAL,0.37681135535240173
"First, inflation is historically low, perhaps at the bottom of the acceptable range, and has recently continued its decline.",2004-01-04,NEUTRAL,0.9362125992774963
"Second, rapid productivity growth has led to actual declines in nominal production costs, which reduce current and future inflationary pressures.",2004-01-04,HAWKISH,0.93854820728302
"Finally, the labor market remains soft, reflecting the fact that growth in aggregate demand has been so far insufficient to absorb the increases in aggregate supply afforded by higher productivity.",2004-01-04,NEUTRAL,0.5721213817596436
A soft labor market will keep a lid on the growth in the cost of employing workers.,2004-01-04,HAWKISH,0.5804287195205688

Do these developments imply a significant increase in inflation risk at the level of the final consumer?,2004-01-04,HAWKISH,0.931416928768158
"First, the recent movements in commodity prices are hardly surprising; they are in fact quite normal for this stage of the business cycle.",2004-01-04,DOVISH,0.919765293598175
"The acceleration in the core PPI for crude materials that we have seen is about what should have been expected, given the increases that have occurred recently in both domestic and worldwide economic activity.4 The increase in the demand for commodities from China alone has been substantial; for example, that country's share of world copper consumption is estimated to have risen from less than 5 percent in 1990 to 20 percent in 2003.",2004-01-04,HAWKISH,0.9646307229995728
"The much more moderate acceleration in intermediate goods prices can likewise be traced to the increase in economic activity, with some additional effect coming from the decline in the dollar and the indirect impact of increases in energy prices.",2004-01-04,HAWKISH,0.9823018312454224
"Second, the direct effects of commodity price inflation on consumer inflation are empirically minuscule, both because raw materials costs are a small portion of total cost and because part of any increase in the cost of materials tends to be absorbed in the margins of final goods producers and distributors.",2004-01-04,DOVISH,0.6322022676467896
"Accelerations in commodity prices comparable to or larger than the most recent one occurred following the 1981-82 and 1990-91 recessions, as well as in 1986-87 and 1999, with no noticeable impact on inflation at the consumer level.5 A reasonable rule of thumb is that a permanent 10 percent increase in raw materials prices will lead to perhaps a 0.7 percent increase in the price of intermediate goods and to less than a 0.1 percent increase in consumer prices.",2004-01-04,DOVISH,0.8403447866439819
"Thus the recent acceleration in commodity prices, even if it were to persist (and futures prices suggest that it will not), would likely add only a tenth or two to the core inflation rate.",2004-01-04,DOVISH,0.5401204228401184
"In short, rising commodity prices are a better signal of strengthening economic activity than of inflation at the consumer level.",2004-01-04,HAWKISH,0.95927494764328

"Certainly, this short-term decline in broad money is not to be taken as evidence of tight monetary policy!6 To summarize, 2003 seems to have marked the turning point for the U.

"February 21, 2020 Financial Markets and Monetary Policy: Is There a Hall of Mirrors Problem?",2020-02-21,DOVISH,0.8810794949531555
"Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the 2020 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, sponsored by the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, New York, New York Share Thank you to the conference organizers for inviting me here to discuss what former Chair Bernanke has famously referred to as a ""hall of mirrors"" problem: a situation in which a central bank's reaction function and financial market prices interact in economically suboptimal and potentially destabilizing ways.1 In my remarks today, I will lay out the way I think about the interplay between financial markets and monetary policy, with a focus on how I myself seek to integrate noisy but often correlated signals about the economy that I glean from models, surveys, and financial markets.2 Three Observations I begin with three unobjectionable observations.",2020-02-21,DOVISH,0.9848384857177734
"First, because of Friedman's long and variable lags, monetary policy should beâ€”and, at the Fed, isâ€”forward looking.",2020-02-21,DOVISH,0.9558001756668091
"Policy decisions made today will have no effect on today's inflation or unemployment rates, so good policy needs to assess where the economic fundamentals are going tomorrow to calibrate appropriate policy today.",2020-02-21,DOVISH,0.9737642407417297
"Thus, central banks and financial markets are looking at the same data on macro fundamentals to make inferences about the future path of the economy, and, of course, any decisions on the policy path made by the central bank will influence asset prices through the discount factor.",2020-02-21,DOVISH,0.9810999035835266
So optimal monetary policy will (almost) always be correlated with asset prices.,2020-02-21,DOVISH,0.9630056023597717
"Second, because key variables that are crucial inputs for conducting monetary policyâ€”such as r*, u*, and expected inflation, to name just threeâ€”are both unobserved and time varying, responsible monetary policy requires informed views about how these variables evolve over time as well as a humility and an appreciation for the uncertainties surrounding baseline views, however well informed they might be.",2020-02-21,DOVISH,0.9705943465232849
"Third, when trying to make an inference about unobserved variables like r* or expected inflation, it is generally a good idea to seek data from multiple signals correlated with the variable of interest, so long as the signals themselves are not perfectly correlated with one another.",2020-02-21,DOVISH,0.9524644613265991
"Think of this third unobjectionable observation as a sort of ""model averaging"" or ""triangulation"" principle of robust inference in a noisy and complex environment.3 Data Dependence As I have written before, monetary policy needs to beâ€”and, at the Fed, isâ€” ""data dependent"" in two distinct ways.4 Policy should be data dependent in the sense that incoming data indicate the position of the economy relative to the ultimate objectives of price stability and maximum employment.",2020-02-21,DOVISH,0.93959641456604
"This information on where the economy is relative to the goals of monetary policy is an important input into standard interest rate feedback rules, such as those introduced by John Taylor in 1993 and ones that continue today to inform monetary policy decisions at the Fed and at other central banks.5 Monetary policy, however, also needs to be data dependent in the second senseâ€”that incoming data contain signalsâ€”that can enable the central bank to update its estimates of r* and u* in order to obtain its best estimate of the destination to which the economy is heading.",2020-02-21,DOVISH,0.9872506856918335
"As I mentioned a moment ago, a challenge for policymakers is that key variables that are essential inputs to monetary policyâ€”such as u*, r*, and expected inflationâ€”cannot be observed directly and must be inferred from observed data.",2020-02-21,DOVISH,0.9612210988998413
"And as is indicated in the Summary of Economic Projections, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants have, over the past seven years, repeatedly revised down their estimates of both u* and r* as unemployment fell and as real interest rates remained well below previous estimates of neutral without the rise in inflation those earlier estimates would have predicted.",2020-02-21,NEUTRAL,0.9535152912139893
"In addition to u* and r*, an important input into any monetary policy assessment is the state of inflation expectations.",2020-02-21,DOVISH,0.936779260635376
"One of the robust messages from the DSGE (dynamic stochastic general equilibrium) literature on optimal monetary policy is that, away from the effective lower bound, optimal monetary policy will not eliminate all inflation volatilityâ€”there are always shocksâ€”but will, under rational expectations (RE), deliver average, and under RE, expected, inflation equal to the target.",2020-02-21,DOVISH,0.5409470200538635
"Since the late 1990s, inflation expectations appear to have been stable and well anchored in the neighborhood of our 2 percent goal.",2020-02-21,DOVISH,0.920312225818634
"However, like r* and u*, inflation expectations are not directly observable and so must be inferred from data.",2020-02-21,DOVISH,0.9413020610809326
Financial Data and Monetary Policy Let me now discuss in more detail how I use a form of model averaging to combine financial market data with data from surveys and econometric models to inform my thinking about the evolution of two key inputs to monetary policy: r* and long-run expected inflation.,2020-02-21,DOVISH,0.9773883819580078
"To be sure, financial market signals are noisy, and day-to-day movements in asset prices are unlikely to tell us much about the cyclical or structural position of the economy, let alone r* and expected inflation.",2020-02-21,DOVISH,0.9592739343643188
"Signals derived from financial market data, when combined with signals revealed from surveys of households and firms along with the filtered estimates from econometric models, can together provide valuable and reasonably robust foundations for real-time inference about the direction of travel in r* and expected inflation.",2020-02-21,DOVISH,0.9867361187934875

"The reason is that prices convey messages to consumers and producers even when the information that drives prices is not aggregated or directly observed.12 For example, a large increase or decrease in the price of gasoline conveys information that influences consumer behavior and that also affects the behavior of energy producers, even when neither of these sets of market participants are aware of the precise factor initiating the price change.",2019-11-01,DOVISH,0.9795103669166565

"For example, Hayek's analysis has proved valuable in the development of standard microeconomics, since his contribution deepened economists' understanding of the working of the price system and promoted further investigation of the question of how decentralized information is transmitted by markets.18 Hayek's emphasis on prices as processors of information has also had applications to international trade theory.19 And in macroeconomics and monetary theory, Milton Friedman's Nobel lecture, published in 1977, cited Hayek's 1945 paper when arguing that, because it disrupted the signals arising from relative-price movements, inflation both lowered the efficiency of the economy and led output to deviate from its natural (or full-employment) level.20 Hayek likened the price mechanism to a ""system of telecommunications,"" and Friedman's description of inflation as a form of ""static"" interrupting price signals was in keeping with this analogy.21 Hayek's ideas on prices influenced Joseph Stiglitz in his analysis of markets with asymmetric information and Roger Myerson's insights on mechanism design theory.",2019-11-01,DOVISH,0.9886564016342163

What is the right conceptual framework for thinking about inflation expectations in the current context?,2007-07-10,DOVISH,0.6923616528511047
"The traditional rational-expectations model of inflation and inflation expectations has been a useful workhorse for thinking about issues of credibility and institutional design, but, to my mind, it is less helpful for thinking about economies in which (1) the structure of the economy is constantly evolving in ways that are imperfectly understood by both the public and policymakers and (2) the policymakers' objective function is not fully known by private agents.",2007-07-10,DOVISH,0.9804147481918335
"In particular, together with the assumption that the central bank's objective function is fixed and known to the public, the traditional rational-expectations approach implies that the public has firm knowledge of the long-run equilibrium inflation rate; consequently, their long-run inflation expectations do not vary over time in response to new information.",2007-07-10,DOVISH,0.9689656496047974
"But in fact, as I will discuss in more detail later, long-run inflation expectations do vary over time.",2007-07-10,DOVISH,0.8169382810592651
"That is, they are not perfectly anchored in real economies; moreover, the extent to which they are anchored can change, depending on economic developments and (most important) the current and past conduct of monetary policy.",2007-07-10,DOVISH,0.9696093201637268
"So, for example, if the public experiences a spell of inflation higher than their long-run expectation, but their long-run expectation of inflation changes little as a result, then inflation expectations are well anchored.",2007-07-10,HAWKISH,0.6963345408439636
"If, on the other hand, the public reacts to a short period of higher-than-expected inflation by marking up their long-run expectation considerably, then expectations are poorly anchored.",2007-07-10,HAWKISH,0.9845529794692993
"Although variations in the extent to which inflation expectations are anchored are not easily handled in a traditional rational-expectations framework, they seem to fit quite naturally into the burgeoning literature on learning in macroeconomics.",2007-07-10,DOVISH,0.9507877230644226
"In a learning context, the concept of anchored expectations is easily formalized in a variety of ways; in general, if the public is modeled as being confident in its current estimate of the long-run inflation rate, so that new information has relatively little effect on that estimate, then the essential idea of well-anchored expectations has been captured.",2007-07-10,DOVISH,0.974828839302063

Implications of Anchored Inflation ExpectationsWhy do we care about the variability of inflation expectations?,2007-07-10,DOVISH,0.8690635561943054

"Mishkin illustrated this point by considering the implications of the fact that inflation expectations have become much better anchored over the past thirty years for the estimated coefficients of the conventional Phillips curve, which I define here to encompass specifications that use lagged values of inflation to proxy for expectations or other sources of inflation inertia.",2007-07-10,DOVISH,0.6557065844535828
"As he noted, many studies of the conventional Phillips curve find that the sensitivity of inflation to activity indicators is lower today than in the past (that is, the Phillips curve appears to have become flatter);1 and that the long-run effect on inflation of ""supply shocks,"" such as changes in the price of oil, also appears to be lower than in the past (Hooker, 2002).",2007-07-10,DOVISH,0.9771665334701538

"Likewise, a lower sensitivity of long-run inflation to supply shocks would imply that such shocks are much less likely to generate economic instability today than they would have been several decades ago.",2007-07-10,DOVISH,0.8984143733978271
"Notably, the sharp increases in energy prices over the past few years have not led either to persistent inflation or to a recession, in contrast (for example) to the U.S. experience of the 1970s.",2007-07-10,HAWKISH,0.781610906124115
"Various factors might account for these changes in the Phillips curve, but, as Mishkin pointed out, better-anchored inflation expectations--themselves, of course, the product of monetary policies that brought inflation down and have kept it relatively stable--certainly play some role.",2007-07-10,HAWKISH,0.9434942007064819
"If people set prices and wages with reference to the rate of inflation they expect in the long run and if inflation expectations respond less than previously to variations in economic activity, then inflation itself will become relatively more insensitive to the level of activity--that is, the conventional Phillips curve will be flatter.",2007-07-10,DOVISH,0.9718125462532043

"A related implication is that, if inflation expectations are well anchored, changes in energy (and food) prices should have relatively little influence on ""core"" inflation, that is, inflation excluding the prices of food and energy.",2007-07-10,DOVISH,0.943581759929657

"Models of the term structure of interest rates better fit the data under the assumption that both inflation expectations and beliefs about the central bank's reaction function are evolving (Kozicki and Tinsley, 2001; Rudebusch and Wu, 2003; Cogley, 2005).",2007-07-10,DOVISH,0.9574968814849854
An indirect but elegant way to make the point that inflation expectations remain imperfectly anchored comes from a statistical analysis of inflation by Stock and Watson (2007).,2007-07-10,HAWKISH,0.7392637729644775
"Stock and Watson model inflation as having two components, which may be interpreted as the trend and the cycle.",2007-07-10,DOVISH,0.9647191166877747
Changes in the trend component are highly persistent whereas shocks to the cyclical component are temporary.2 The key finding of this research is that the variability of the trend component of inflation (and thus the share of the overall variability of inflation that it can explain) appears to have fallen significantly after about 1983.,2007-07-10,DOVISH,0.9912080764770508
"That is, unexpected changes in inflation are today much more likely to be transitory than they were before the early 1980s.",2007-07-10,DOVISH,0.8084607124328613
"Because it seems quite unlikely that changes in inflation could persist indefinitely unless long-run expectations of inflation also changed, I interpret the Stock-Watson finding as consistent with the view that inflation expectations have become much more anchored since the early 1980s.",2007-07-10,HAWKISH,0.6688677072525024

"Current Economic Situation and Outlook In the second quarter of last year, the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic and the mitigation efforts put in place to contain it delivered the most severe blow to the U.S. economy since the Great Depression, but economic activity rebounded sharply in the third quarter, supported by a robust and unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy response.",2021-02-24,NEUTRAL,0.8507397770881653
"Although more than half of the 22 million jobs that were lost last spring have been regained, the unemployment rate remained elevated at 6.3 percent in January, and once one factors in the decline in the labor force since the onset of the pandemic and misclassification, the true unemployment rate is closer to 10 percent.",2021-02-24,NEUTRAL,0.9926052093505859

"The housing sector has more than fully recovered from the downturn, supported in part by low mortgage interest rates.",2021-02-24,DOVISH,0.6260417699813843
"And while the economy might not continue to grow at the once-in-a-century 33 percent annualized rate of growth reported in the third quarter of 2020, it is clear that the economy has turned out to be more resilient in adapting to the virus, and more responsive to monetary and fiscal policy support, than many predicted.",2021-02-24,HAWKISH,0.887106716632843
"Indeed, it is worth highlighting that in the baseline projections of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) presented in the latest Summary of Economic Projections, released last December, most of my colleagues and I revised up our outlooks for the economy over the medium term, projecting a relatively rapid return to levels of employment and inflation consistent with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate as compared with the recovery from the Global Financial Crisis (GFC).2 In particular, the median FOMC participant projected in December that by the end of 2023â€”a little less than three years from nowâ€”the unemployment rate will have fallen below 4 percent, and PCE inflation will have returned to 2 percent.",2021-02-24,HAWKISH,0.49889326095581055

"As announced in the September statement and reiterated in the following statements, with inflation running persistently below 2 percent, our policy will aim to achieve inflation outcomes that keep inflation expectations well anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal.3 We expect to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomesâ€”as well as our maximum-employment mandateâ€”are achieved.",2021-02-24,NEUTRAL,0.9695504903793335

"With regard to our price-stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importanceâ€”and the challengeâ€”of keeping inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent in a world in which an effective-lower-bound constraint is, in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate.",2021-02-24,HAWKISH,0.9913245439529419
"To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it ""seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,"" andâ€”in the same sentenceâ€”that therefore ""following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.""",2021-02-24,NEUTRAL,0.5688722133636475

"Although backward-looking measures of inflation--such as the four-quarter growth in core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) prices--imply that the FOMC's cumulative 75 basis points of tightening so far this year has moved the real federal funds rate into positive territory for the first time in almost three years, that observation is not sufficient to calibrate the stance of policy.",2004-10-29,HAWKISH,0.9694651961326599

"That said, policymakers do strive to understand what the equilibrium real interest rate will be over the long run, but that is a forward-looking notion that depends on our sense of how the forces of productivity and thrift will evolve over time as measured in decades.",2004-10-29,DOVISH,0.9527595043182373
"An understanding of a likely long-run level of the equilibrium real rate is useful, even though the level is not directly observable, because it provides a general sense of the level that would, over that longer period, allow aggregate supply and demand to move into balance, given the evaluation of secular forces such as productivity and population growth.",2004-10-29,DOVISH,0.9785388112068176

"For example, an unusual hesitancy on the part of businesses to hire and spend emerged in 2001 after the collapse of equity prices and was subsequently reinforced by corporate-governance concerns; this hesitancy could be thought of as pulling the equilibrium real federal funds rate down temporarily below its longer-run value.",2004-10-29,NEUTRAL,0.9902837872505188

"From that perspective, the FOMC's reduction in the actual nominal federal funds rate over this period from the level of 6-1/2 percent that prevailed at the beginning of 2001 to the forty-five-year low of 1 percent by mid-2003 had three components: (1) A reduction to match the decline in inflation expectations so as to prevent the real funds rate from rising inappropriately, (2) an effort to chase a downwardly moving equilibrium real rate given the pressures on aggregate demand, and (3) an effort to bring the actual real rate below its apparently lowered equilibrium to provide sufficient stimulus to cope with transitory adverse factors and to speed the recovery in production and employment.",2004-10-29,NEUTRAL,0.9881194233894348
This is a tangible recent example of the need both to judge how the equilibrium real interest rate that is relevant for policy might have changed from a perceived long-run level and to set policy against the background of such an understanding.,2004-10-29,DOVISH,0.9658510088920593
"And, in the context of well-contained inflation, the evidence of remaining underused resources gives us a good reason to hold the real rate below even the intermediate-run notion of its equilibrium to allow the economy to be firmly set on a path that will shrink the pool of these underused resources over a reasonable period.",2004-10-29,NEUTRAL,0.8233317136764526

"The rapid expansion of labor productivity has raised the growth of economic potential, increased permanent income and wealth, and created an important inducement to add to the capital stock.",2004-10-29,HAWKISH,0.7082076072692871
"All else equal, a higher growth rate of productivity will be associated with a more elevated equilibrium real rate.",2004-10-29,HAWKISH,0.8976090550422668

Business hesitancy might lift abruptly and would be evidenced by large increases in business demand for capital and labor resources; households might maintain a very low savings rate; and government policy might not return quickly to a more-balanced posture.,2004-10-29,HAWKISH,0.7622736692428589
"Any of these factors might imply that the equilibrium rate relevant for policy returns more quickly to, or even moves above, its long-run level as fewer forces weigh on aggregate demand.",2004-10-29,DOVISH,0.9450388550758362
"Otherwise, we risk a buildup of inflationary pressures.",2004-10-29,HAWKISH,0.9600945115089417

"One could presume that the forward real rate of interest implied by yields on longer-term indexed debt--or the real return provided, say, over the period five to ten years from now--conveys a sense of market participants' view of the long-run equilibrium real interest rate.3 Unfortunately for such an inference, however, longer-term yields embody expectations of future interest rates, a term premium, and potentially a premium for the relative illiquidity of these instruments, so this technique will provide an overestimate of the equilibrium real rate.",2004-10-29,DOVISH,0.9830390214920044
"I was reassured in my acceptance of Axel's invitation by David Laidler's survey paper, which found more successes than not over the past two decades.1 A concise summary of this success is evident in the performance of consumer price inflation in the advanced economies.",2007-09-21,DOVISH,0.9394814372062683

David suggests that monetarism failed when its proponents got too prescriptive by advocating rigid rules for money growth.,2007-09-21,DOVISH,0.7792074084281921
"As evidence of that humility on my part, let me also agree with David that two important questions about the conduct of monetary policy have not yet been resolved.",2007-09-21,DOVISH,0.9241061806678772
"First, what is the best way to pursue price stability, and, second, how should asset prices be taken into account in steering policy?",2007-09-21,DOVISH,0.5531318783760071
"In many countries, though not my own, the answer to the first question has been that price stability should be pursued through the formal apparatus of an inflation target, which typically includes establishing an inflation goal by the government, setting metrics to evaluate central bank performance, and periodically communicating progress to the public.",2007-09-21,HAWKISH,0.7052212357521057
"Although correlation does not convey causation, the spread of such regimes has coincided with sustained low global inflation.",2007-09-21,HAWKISH,0.6126846671104431
"In addition, no adopter of an inflation target has subsequently abandoned it.",2007-09-21,DOVISH,0.8712586164474487
"Inflation has come down worldwide, in countries without, as well as with, inflation targets.",2007-09-21,HAWKISH,0.9050424695014954
"Moreover, I share David's puzzlement about why an explicit inflation goal should make a substantial difference in performance given the paucity of evidence showing that choosing a target directly affects the level of the public's inflation expectations.",2007-09-21,DOVISH,0.9611715078353882
"That said, I am relatively more persuaded that inflation targeting helps reduce the variance of inflation expectations.",2007-09-21,HAWKISH,0.9361917972564697
"Evidence has accumulated to suggest that stock prices, interest rates, and measures of inflation expectations seem to vary less in economies in which the central bank has an explicit long-run goal for inflation.",2007-09-21,DOVISH,0.9675943851470947
I suspect that this better anchoring of expectations and the success of inflation targeting in many countries is attributable in part to aspects of the political economy that David identified.,2007-09-21,DOVISH,0.77363520860672
"A formal inflation target represents a national embrace of a goal, in which elected authorities recognize the primacy of price stability and publicly support--indeed, even require--the central bank's pursuit of that goal.",2007-09-21,HAWKISH,0.765629768371582
"To the extent that elected authorities channel the desires of the electorate, a central bank directed to adopt an inflation target is being given a strong signal as to the goal's importance to the public at large.",2007-09-21,HAWKISH,0.9577540755271912
An important effect of such public acceptance of price stability is that it erodes the standing of those who would direct central bank action toward other ends.,2007-09-21,HAWKISH,0.803923487663269
"In most other instances, the adoption of an inflation target involved laws and mutual understandings, not constitutional changes.",2007-09-21,DOVISH,0.8339861631393433
"The early adopters of inflation targets were parliamentary democracies, which is not too surprising given that in such a system a single branch of government can enact laws and put them into effect.",2007-09-21,DOVISH,0.8944897651672363

"Moreover, those two branches have already spoken as to the appropriate aim of the nation's central bank: The Congress, in a law the President signed, has given the Federal Reserve a dual mandate that directs us to foster maximum employment and stable prices over time.",2007-09-21,HAWKISH,0.7968300580978394
"Nor is this instruction unreasonable, in that the dual mandate has come to be interpreted as assigning us the responsibility for attaining price stability in the long run, which will bring with it maximum employment, and of being mindful of resource utilization in the succession of short runs that make up the long run.",2007-09-21,HAWKISH,0.9142957925796509
"The dual mandate seems proper and fitting, given that economic costs are incurred both by having inflation stray from its long-run goal and by having output deviate from the economy's potential to produce; and it seems to produce results not too different in practice from those associated with central banks that are flexible inflation targeters.",2007-09-21,DOVISH,0.9690607190132141
"As I said earlier, anchoring expectations has value, in that it makes planning easier, reduces resources spent on predicting and protecting against unexpected variations in nominal magnitudes, and grants a central bank greater scope to lean against fluctuations in output while keeping inflation contained.",2007-09-21,DOVISH,0.9537858963012695
"The latter is particularly attractive given our dual mandate, in that better-anchored inflation expectations could produce the win-win outcome of improving the attainment of both goals.",2007-09-21,HAWKISH,0.9352489709854126
"For that reason, in its consideration of its communications strategies, the Federal Open Market Committee has been discussing whether mechanisms could be put in place that could better anchor inflation expectations in a manner consistent with the institutional framework of our dual mandate.",2007-09-21,HAWKISH,0.9778574705123901

"November 08, 2021 Flexible Average Inflation Targeting and Prospects for U.S. Monetary Policy Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the Symposium on Monetary Policy Frameworks, The Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share Watch Live Outlooks and Outcomes for the U.S. Economy The U.S. economy in the second quarter of this year made the transition from economic recovery to economic expansion.1 Given the catastrophic collapse in U.S. economic activity in the first half of 2020 as a result of the global pandemic and the mitigation efforts put in place to contain it, few forecasters could have expectedâ€”or even dared to hopeâ€”in the spring of last year that the recovery in gross domestic product (GDP), from the sharpest decline in activity since the Great Depression, would be either so robust or as rapid.",2021-11-08,NEUTRAL,0.51871258020401
"Indeed, the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating Committee determined in July that the recession that began in March of last year ended in April, making it not only the deepest recession on record, but also the briefest.2 The recovery that commenced in the summer of 2020 was quite robust, and, with one quarter to go, GDP growth in 2021 is projected by the Fed and many outside forecasters to be the fastest since 1983.",2021-11-08,HAWKISH,0.8037517070770264
"That said, under the median projection for GDP growth in the September Summary of Economic projections, the level of real GDP will have returned to its pre pandemic trend growth trajectory by the fourth quarter of 2021, which if realized would represent one of the most rapid such recoveries in 50 years.3 In the September SEP round, my individual projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the policy rate path turned out to be quite close to the path of SEP medians for each of these variables over the 2021â€“24 projection window.",2021-11-08,DOVISH,0.8287259936332703
"Under these projections, GDP growth steps down from 5.9 percent this year to 3.8 percent in 2022 and further to 2.5 percent and 2 percent in 2023 and 2024, respectively.",2021-11-08,NEUTRAL,0.9063568115234375
"Not surprisingly, the projected path of above-trend GDP growth in 2021 and 2022 translates into rapid declines in the projected path for the unemployment rate, which is projected to fall to 3.8 percent by the end of 2022 and 3.5 percent by the end of 2023.",2021-11-08,HAWKISH,0.9577207565307617
"This modal projection for the path of the unemployment rate is, according to the Atlanta Fed jobs calculator, consistent with a rebound in labor force participation to its estimated demographic trend and is also consistent with cumulative employment gains this year and next that, by the end of 2022, eliminate the 4.2 million ""employment gap"" relative to the previous cycle peak.4 My projections for headline and core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation are, alas, also similar to the median SEP numbers.",2021-11-08,DOVISH,0.94978266954422
"Under the projected SEP path for inflation, core PCE inflation surges to at least 3.7 percent this year before reverting back to 2.3 percent in 2022, 2.2 percent in 2023, and 2.1 percent in 2024.",2021-11-08,DOVISH,0.5034381151199341
"Thus, the baseline outlook for inflation over the three-year projection window reflects the judgment, shared with many outside forecasters, that under appropriate monetary policy, most of the inflation overshoot relative to the longer-run goal of 2 percent will, in the end, prove to be transitory.",2021-11-08,DOVISH,0.518166720867157
"Although in a number of sectors of the economy the imbalances between demand and supplyâ€”including labor supplyâ€”are substantial, I do continue to judge that these imbalances are likely to dissipate over time as the labor market and global supply chains eventually adjust and, importantly, do so without putting persistent upward pressure on price inflation and wage gains adjusted for productivity.",2021-11-08,DOVISH,0.9844921827316284
"First, realized PCE inflation so far this year represents, to me, much more than a ""moderate"" overshoot of our 2 percent longer-run inflation objective, and I would not consider a repeat performance next year a policy success.",2021-11-08,HAWKISH,0.9773483276367188

"Prospects for U.S. Monetary Policy In September 2020, the FOMC introducedâ€”and since then has reaffirmedâ€”outcome-based, threshold guidance that specifies three conditions that the Committee expects will be met before it considers increasing the target range for the federal funds rate, currently 0 to 25 basis points.5 This guidance in September of last year brought the forward guidance on the federal funds rate in the statement into alignment with the new flexible average inflation targeting framework adopted in August 2020.6 To quote from the statement, these conditions are that ""labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.""",2021-11-08,DOVISH,0.7834880352020264

A Reverse Soft Landing Figure 1.B depicts an alternative scenario in which the above-trend growth in the expansion phase has moved the economy beyond the point of its sustainable capacity to produce.,2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.9576737284660339
"In this case, because the economy is already operating beyond its sustainable capacity, the economy may not be able to avoid some acceleration in inflation as policymakers try to engineer the soft landing.",2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.9899133443832397
"Therefore, the return to the potential output path has to be achieved in a sufficiently timely fashion to minimize any increase in inflation during the transition.",2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.9875878691673279

"Hence, whereas the soft landing outcome in figure 1.A involves a stabilization of the unemployment rate at its low point and of inflation near its recent low, in the reverse soft landing case depicted in figure 1.B, both inflation and unemployment rates are likely to rise during the transition.",2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.9544097781181335
The Best-Case Scenario: Supply Meets Demand The first two scenarios I have described assume that demand has to adjust to a steady supply path to achieve sustainability.,2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.6664643287658691
"There are natural equilibrating mechanisms, as well as policy adjustments, that encourage such adjustment in demand relative to supply.",2000-01-20,DOVISH,0.8782810568809509
An alternative scenario is that supply adjusts to demand.,2000-01-20,DOVISH,0.8529245257377625
This case is depicted in figure 1.C in which the growth of potential increases just as output threatens to push beyond potential.,2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.959977388381958
"If this scenario describes the current episode, then the economy can continue to grow at 4 percent, the unemployment rate can remain near 4 percent, and inflation can remain steady at its prevailing rate.",2000-01-20,DOVISH,0.9359562397003174
"But it has the advantage of incorporating the role of supply-side as well as demand-side forces that appear to be at work in this expansion, and it would at least help explain the stability of inflation at prevailing growth and unemployment rates.",2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.8873370885848999
"Indeed, a possible decline in the NAIRU and, especially, an increase in the growth rate of potential output appear to be essential elements of this expansion.",2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.9378879070281982

The first involves the reversal of an imbalance between aggregate supply and aggregate demand.,2000-01-20,DOVISH,0.5302464365959167
I will focus first on the boom-bust scenario to complete my classification of paths to sustainable combinations of growth and the output gap.,2000-01-20,DOVISH,0.9715058207511902
"In the boom-bust scenario, depicted in figure 1.D, above-trend output growth during the expansion ultimately pushes output well beyond potential for a persistent period.",2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.9569509625434875
The resulting overheating puts upward pressure on inflation.,2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.9576355814933777
"The monetary policy response to reverse the inflation often yields a decline in output, as depicted here, resulting in a period of economic slack and a reversal of the rise in inflation.",2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.8658861517906189
"This is the scenario from which we draw the lesson that timely, typically preemptive, policy restraint to avoid the excesses of a boom results in longer expansions and avoids unnecessary fluctuations in both output and inflation.",2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.9144241213798523
"To identify whether the initial conditions today correspond to those in one of the panels of figure 1, we have to assess where output is relative to its potential and whether growth is above or below trend.",2000-01-20,DOVISH,0.9762654900550842
This assignment is more difficult than usual because structural changes of uncertain dimension may have raised both the level and the growth rate of potential output.,2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.8970165252685547
There is also a consensus that the rate of growth of potential output is higher today than during the twenty years preceding this expansion.,2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.9641296863555908
"In particular, some think that the rapid growth and low unemployment rate of the past two years represent the economy's new equilibrium (case 1.C), but others believe that the economy has still been running ahead of potential recently, despite structural changes.",2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.5540512800216675

"Table 1 offers various estimates of the NAIRU and trend growth, drawn from researchers, model-based forecasts, assumptions incorporated in government budget projections, and surveys of economic forecasters.",2000-01-20,DOVISH,0.9297439455986023
These estimates suggest that actual output is above potential (the unemployment rate is below the NAIRU) and that actual output growth has been above trend growth of potential.,2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.9796313643455505
"Despite the uncertainties, the consensus estimates of the NAIRU and the growth of potential give us a hint about what type of landing we should be aiming for and which of the scenarios depicted in figure 1 best describe the economy's initial conditions and prospects.",2000-01-20,DOVISH,0.9843988418579102
"That is, even after we incorporate the estimated decline in the NAIRU and the higher rate of growth of potential (as reflected in figure 1.C), output is above potential and output growth exceeds that of potential (as depicted in figures 1.B and 1.D).",2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.9730620980262756
"To complete the picture, we also have to rely on the temporary disinflationary effects of favorable relative-price shocks and the increase in the productivity trend that have allowed the economy to operate, for a while, beyond potential without suffering inflationary consequences.",2000-01-20,NEUTRAL,0.6469960808753967

Common Sources of Recent Developments What I do want to focus on this afternoon are possible common sources for the developments pictured in figure 2 and the relation of any imbalance between aggregate supply and demand to those developments.,2000-01-20,DOVISH,0.9745817184448242
"During expansions, equity prices tend to rise, although they often decline before a downturn in the economy.",2000-01-20,DOVISH,0.9339437484741211
"The unemployment rate, for example, has declined to a 30-year low.",2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.757318913936615
"Private domestic demand typically is the driver of expansions, but its contribution has been even greater than usual this time.",2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.7660180926322937
"The direct contribution of federal government spending and tax changes, reflected in the swing in the federal budget from deficit to surplus, has been a net drag on growth.",2000-01-20,NEUTRAL,0.880252480506897
So the pace of domestic private demand has been even stronger than the growth in overall output.,2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.9799768924713135
"Private domestic spending has been driven, in part, by the wealth effect arising from higher equity prices, a situation that also helps to explain much of the decline in the personal saving rate, and has been financed by a higher household debt and by the tapping of foreign saving.",2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.9704160094261169
Also the two types of imbalances--an imbalance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply and sector or market imbalances--could be connected.,2000-01-20,DOVISH,0.8175299167633057
Consider a situation in which growth is above trend and output moves beyond capacity.,2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.8977234363555908
"If investors misread these developments as sustainable and, therefore, extrapolate the exceptional conditions, exceptional and perhaps unsustainable movements in equity prices, the saving rate, and debt burden might be encouraged.",2000-01-20,DOVISH,0.8409509062767029
"Alternatively, a rise in equity prices that outstrips fundamentals might contribute to a pace of private domestic demand that ultimately takes output beyond capacity; in this case, the market or sector imbalance would be what contributed to the aggregate demand-supply imbalance.",2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.9835260510444641
"Finally, market or sector imbalances could possibly rise to worrisome proportions in the absence of an imbalance between aggregate demand and supply.",2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.811430811882019
This analysis leaves us with four possible combinations: (1) simultaneous imbalances in both aggregate demand/supply and market/sector variables; (2) simultaneous balance in each class; (3) aggregate demand/supply imbalance accompanied by balance in market/sector variables; and (4) aggregate demand/supply balance accompanied by market/sector imbalances.,2000-01-20,DOVISH,0.9525476694107056
"A decline in the stock market might also, for example, reduce confidence in the U.S. economy and reduce the willingness of foreigners to accumulate the increment in U.S. liabilities associated with the current account deficit.",2000-01-20,NEUTRAL,0.9152694344520569
"As a result of these considerations, simple multiplier exercises, such as the effect on the economy of a given percentage decline in equity prices, probably tell more about the econometric model used than about prospects for the economy.",2000-01-20,DOVISH,0.8949334025382996
"The Challenge for Monetary Policy The most important of the perceived imbalances I have discussed today is, in my view, the possibility of an overheated economy.",2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.9604633450508118
"In three of the four combinations of aggregate demand/supply and market/sector imbalances, it seems to me that the best approach would be to focus directly on the aggregate demand/supply imbalance and allow the indirect effects of such a policy to mitigate any other imbalances.",2000-01-20,DOVISH,0.49615737795829773
"In addition, any other imbalances are more likely to grow to worrisome proportions during an unsustainable boom and are more likely to unwind in a disruptive manner if confronted by rising inflation, sharply higher interest rates in response to higher inflation, and a subsequent recession.",2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.9822326898574829
That leaves the possibility that there might be cases when we face market/sector imbalances in the absence of any aggregate demand/supply imbalance.,2000-01-20,DOVISH,0.9659449458122253
"In such a case, the level and growth of output are sustainable in the sense that they are not putting pressure on inflation; but this aggregate balance might be threatened subsequently by a spontaneous unwinding of a market/sector imbalance.",2000-01-20,DOVISH,0.7734248638153076
What role can and should monetary policy play in such a case?,2000-01-20,DOVISH,0.9122341871261597
"Furthermore, it is not obvious how to unwind an excessive debt burden, to raise the personal saving rate, or to narrow the current account deficit in a sustainable way through monetary policy.",2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.518941342830658
"As a result, monetary policy, in my view, needs to focus on achieving balance between aggregate supply and aggregate demand.",2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.8187207579612732
"In pursuing this course, monetary policy is confronted by two competing challenges.",2000-01-20,DOVISH,0.8314260244369507
The first is to allow the economy to realize the benefits of any decline in the NAIRU and any increase in trend growth.,2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.8511545062065125
Supporting maximum sustainable growth is very much the business of monetary policy.,2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.7531498670578003
But achieving maximum sustainable growth also is about ensuring the sustainability of an expansion and hence avoiding overheating.,2000-01-20,HAWKISH,0.9818873405456543
"I focus on the change in the consensus forecast because, in my judgment, it is the revision in the outlook for 1999 in response to recent developments in the global economy and domestic financial markets that justified the recent easing of monetary policy.",1998-10-05,NEUTRAL,0.9650452733039856
Then I will conclude with a discussion of the implications of the outlook for monetary policy.,1998-10-05,DOVISH,0.8969946503639221
"The key here is to explain the rapid change in the posture of monetary policy--from a stance of asymmetric toward tightening just a few months ago, to symmetric, and then to an easing.",1998-10-05,HAWKISH,0.43995019793510437
Let me emphasize that the views on the economic outlook and monetary policy I present this morning are my own.,1998-10-05,DOVISH,0.8632410764694214

Your forecast also presumes a flexible monetary policy that responds to changing conditions and effectively promotes such an outcome.,1998-10-05,DOVISH,0.8656901717185974
"Judging from the path of the Treasury bill rate, the Blue Chip forecast assumed no change in monetary policy through 1999.",1998-10-05,DOVISH,0.9682612419128418

"More likely, it reflects the fact that during this period, there have also been continuing upside surprises with respect to domestic demand.",1998-10-05,HAWKISH,0.9375689029693604
"As a result, the upward revisions to the forecast for domestic demand may have just offset downward revisions to the forecast for net exports.",1998-10-05,DOVISH,0.738418459892273
"More recently, it also appears to reflect your confidence in monetary policy, a theme that I will return to later.",1998-10-05,DOVISH,0.9064517617225647
A soft landing is achieved if growth slows to trend just as the economy converges to potential output.,1998-10-05,HAWKISH,0.5390397906303406
"In this case, growth has to slow to a below-trend rate until actual output again converges to potential, at which point growth returns to and remains at trend.",1998-10-05,NEUTRAL,0.9504798054695129
"The characterization of the forecast as a reverse soft landing hinges on the interpretation that the unemployment rate is initially below NAIRU and that growth slows below trend going forward, allowing the transition back toward NAIRU.",1998-10-05,HAWKISH,0.7862088680267334
"While this is consistent with your estimates of NAIRU and trend growth, I was, nevertheless, surprised that your estimate of NAURU was as low as it was, 4.9%, and that your estimate of trend growth, 2.7%, was as high as it was.",1998-10-05,DOVISH,0.8164595365524292

"It reflects, I expect, on the inflation side, both the contribution of demand pressures in the labor market, as a consequence of the initial conditions, and dissipation or even reversal of the favorable supply shocks that have been restraining inflation.",1998-10-05,HAWKISH,0.9576101899147034

I focus here on the contributions from net exports and private domestic demand.,1998-10-05,DOVISH,0.9091249704360962
An external shock lowers net exports and slows GDP growth; the resulting slowdown in GDP growth then weakens domestic demand.,1998-10-05,NEUTRAL,0.9907976388931274

The strength of domestic demand and the subtraction via net exports were very similar in both quarters.,1998-10-05,DOVISH,0.9259545207023621
The explanation for the stability of GDP growth was the surprising surge of private domestic demand that offset the sharper-than-expected decline in net exports.,1998-10-05,HAWKISH,0.7923080325126648

This raises two questions: Why did private demand soar in the first half and why will the economy slow going forward?,1998-10-05,DOVISH,0.7490496039390564
"To be sure, recent developments have reinforced the negative outlook for the external sector and net exports will be subtracting from GDP growth going forward.",1998-10-05,NEUTRAL,0.9830899238586426

"Second, the correction in equity prices points to a downward revision to consumer spending and to business fixed investment and residential construction as well.",1998-10-05,NEUTRAL,0.988707423210144
Phase one resulted in a powerful adverse shock to U.S. aggregate demand as a result of the decline in net exports induced by the combination of recessions and sharp depreciations in the region.,1998-10-05,NEUTRAL,0.9184245467185974
"But the same global turmoil that undermined net exports also brought a shift in portfolio preferences toward dollar-denominated assets, resulting in lower interest rates and perhaps adding to the resilience of U.S. equity markets.",1998-10-05,NEUTRAL,0.9746784567832947

"There has been a sharp correction of equity prices, in the United States and around the world, and rising risk spreads offset and, for the riskier borrowers, more than offset the effect of further declines in government bond rates.",1998-10-05,HAWKISH,0.9334028363227844
So phase two has added to the projected decline in net exports ahead and broadened the impact of global turmoil on domestic demand by undermining the favorable set of financial conditions that had been so important in promoting strong growth over the last couple of years.,1998-10-05,NEUTRAL,0.8206101655960083

"They do not, I believe, fully explain the surge in domestic demand in the first half.",1998-10-05,DOVISH,0.7248225212097168
Part of this surge may have reflected the lagged effects of the long period of rising equity prices and declining long-term rates.,1998-10-05,DOVISH,0.5425516963005066
But part may simply have been an unexplained and fortuitous positive demand surprise.,1998-10-05,DOVISH,0.8103994727134705

"Growth is going to slow, in part, because it was unexplainably high in the first half.",1998-10-05,HAWKISH,0.5615537762641907
It reminds me of the explanation of our forecast at LHM&A for a sharp decline in long-term interest rates in 1993.,1998-10-05,NEUTRAL,0.6396724581718445
"The slowdown in 1999 will be the cumulative effect of this spontaneous slowing as the high-flying economy succumbs to the force of gravity and the induced slowing of the economy in response to weaker foreign growth, the recent decline in equity values, and the widening of risk spreads and generally reduced appetite for risk.",1998-10-05,NEUTRAL,0.9856306910514832
A source of such discontinuity arises from possible devaluations in countries on a fixed or pegged exchange rate.,1998-10-05,DOVISH,0.923115611076355
"Whereas under floating rates, a gradual depreciation could take some pressure off an economy subject to an adverse shock, a forced devaluation in a country that can no longer defend its peg often reinforces rather than cushions the downward momentum in the economy in response to an adverse shock and can, therefore, be instrumental in abruptly moving an economy from slow growth to sharp recession.",1998-10-05,NEUTRAL,0.5372545123100281

"Here is a brief overview of the main elements of the enhanced communication strategy: FOMC participants now provide projections for four key macroeconomic variables that together reflect our dual mandate of promoting price stability and maximum sustainable employment: the growth of real gross domestic product (GDP); the unemployment rate; overall consumer inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE); and core consumer inflation, which excludes food and energy prices.2 As I discussed in a recent speech, both inflation measures are important: Core inflation is a useful indicator of the underlying near-term trend of inflation, and overall inflation is what households and businesses ultimately care about (Mishkin, 2007c).",2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.8306282758712769
"Therefore, a significant aspect of the enhanced communication strategy is that the FOMC has added the overall inflation rate to its announced projections.",2007-11-29,HAWKISH,0.9615961313247681
"The quantitative projections indicate participants' assessments of the most likely (that is, modal) outcomes for economic activity and inflation.",2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.9542869329452515
"In particular, each participant makes an independent projection based on his or her own assessment of the ""appropriate"" path of monetary policy; that is, the path seen as most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that are consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate.",2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.9647436141967773
"In the remainder of this speech, I will discuss how the modern science of monetary policy provides a strong rationale for the Federal Reserve's new communication policy, and then I'll describe how a number of key principles of monetary policy making are evident in the latest set of FOMC projections, which were released last week.",2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.8032696843147278
The Rationale for the Federal Reserve's Enhanced Communication StrategyThe modern approach to the formulation of monetary policy is generally characterized by an optimization problem in which policymakers maximize a specific objective function subject to a set of constraints.,2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.8465621471405029
"In contrast, expectations about future monetary policy and economic conditions play a key role in economic agents' decisions and thus are important in both the objective function and the constraints of the optimal monetary policy problem.",2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.9722853899002075
This role of expectations is crucial in understanding why central bank communication is so important for achieving good macroeconomic outcomes.3 Objective Function The modern science of monetary policy proceeds under the assumption that the central bank's purpose is to maximize the well-being of households in the economy; the objective function specifies exactly what should be maximized.,2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.9711896777153015
"Broadly speaking, the objective function has two components, each expressed as a deviation from a goal and each with a negative sign: one component is the deviation of inflation from its optimal level, and the other is the deviation of output (or employment) from its so-called natural level, the level that would be attained if prices and wages were completely flexible.",2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.8705678582191467
"Those components of the objective function capture the essence of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate to promote price stability and maximum employment, a mandate established by the Congress for the ultimate good of the public.",2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.658713161945343
"Constraints In a market-oriented economy like ours, the science of monetary policy explicitly reflects the extent to which households and firms have the freedom to make their own economic decisions.",2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.9542515873908997
The overall level of expenditures in the economy--which macroeconomists refer to as aggregate demand--is the sum of all the spending decisions of individual households and firms.,2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.9607710242271423
"Aggregate demand exhibits a strong forward-looking component because, as noted, the spending decisions of households include their expectations regarding the future path of the economy.",2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.9604529738426208
"Similarly, the overall inflation rate of the economy ultimately reflects the price-setting decisions of individual firms, and expectations have a crucial influence on those decisions as well.",2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.9436277151107788
"However, both aggregate supply and aggregate demand tend to exhibit a substantial degree of inertia, which reflects the significant costs incurred by households and firms in making sudden large adjustments in their consumption, staffing levels, and so forth.",2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.9443817734718323
"Largely because of those inertial elements, monetary policy actions have little or no instantaneous effect on the economy; in fact, the peak effect on aggregate demand may not appear for at least a year, and the peak effect on inflation is subject to even longer lags.",2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.9875794053077698
"Therefore, because the variables the central bank wants to influence have a forward-looking component, and because the effects of policy actions are unlikely to appear for at least a year, macroeconomic projections should have a central role in the monetary policy plan and should appear in the public description of that plan.",2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.9684487581253052
Broadening the scope of communication by including a description of policymakers' expectations helps households and businesses to make more-informed decisions and can help anchor the private sector's inflation expectations more firmly by clarifying and underscoring the central bank's intention to keep inflation low and stable over the long run.,2007-11-29,HAWKISH,0.9528365135192871
"In all of these ways, central-bank communication that more fully portrays policy considerations facilitates the effectiveness of monetary policy and contributes to the overall stability and growth of the economy.",2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.833432137966156
The Science of Monetary Policy and the Longer-Term OutlookI would now like to consider the important information conveyed about the FOMC's longer-term policy strategy in the Federal Reserve's newly released set of macroeconomic projections.,2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.9312331676483154
"In that context, I will also highlight how our longer-term strategy fulfills the dual mandate and embeds some of the key implications of the modern science of monetary policy.",2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.6672725081443787
The Longer-Term Projections for Inflation The projections for both overall and core inflation at the three-year horizon (which is currently 2010) fall in the range of 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent; the central tendency of these projections is 1.6 percent to 1.9 percent.,2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.9846477508544922
"As I noted earlier, each FOMC participant's projection is made under the assumption of ""appropriate"" monetary policy--that is, the path of policy calibrated to achieve outcomes for economic activity and inflation that are most consistent with our dual objectives of price stability and maximum employment.",2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.8276283740997314
"For that reason, the longer-run inflation projections provide information about each FOMC participant's assessment of the inflation rate that best promotes those dual objectives--a rate that I will refer to as the ""mandate-consistent inflation rate.""",2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.9186667799949646
"When the underlying level of inflation is reasonably close to its mandate-consistent rate, monetary policy should be able to achieve that rate of inflation in coming years while keeping economic activity near its maximum sustainable level.",2007-11-29,HAWKISH,0.6847317218780518
"Although overall inflation is currently above the mandate-consistent rate, reflecting the effects of energy price increases, core inflation has been well-behaved.",2007-11-29,HAWKISH,0.9291353821754456
"Thus, I believe this description essentially characterizes the current macroeconomic environment, and my own projection of inflation at a three-year horizon is equal to my assessment of the mandate-consistent inflation rate.",2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.909541130065918
"The range of projections for inflation in 2010--1.5 percent to 2.0 percent--is consistent with a fundamental implication of the modern science of monetary policy--namely, that the well-being of the economy is maximized by maintaining a low and stable inflation rate over time.4 Low inflation promotes social welfare by simplifying the savings and retirement planning of individual households and by facilitating firms' production and investment decisions, all of which helps promote higher productivity growth.",2007-11-29,HAWKISH,0.8766947388648987
"Furthermore, an environment of overall price stability contributes to economic efficiency by reducing the variability of relative prices and by minimizing the distortions that arise because the tax system is not completely indexed to inflation.",2007-11-29,HAWKISH,0.8726398348808289
"Finally, and importantly, low and stable inflation promotes equity and reduces poverty, as the poorest members of society typically do not have access to the sorts of financial instruments that would help protect them against inflation.",2007-11-29,HAWKISH,0.6629319787025452
"At the same time, recent research on the science of monetary policy (as well as the analysis of several historical episodes) has underscored the pitfalls that can result from maintaining a zero or negative inflation rate over time.",2007-11-29,NEUTRAL,0.9495306015014648
"First, such a strategy tends to raise the likelihood of episodes in which short-term nominal interest rates reach the zero lower bound and thereby hinder the conduct of monetary policy.",2007-11-29,NEUTRAL,0.9659360647201538
"Second, an economy with a zero average inflation rate will almost inevitably experience some episodes of deflation, which may adversely affect financial markets and thereby hamper the performance of the macroeconomy.",2007-11-29,NEUTRAL,0.9894329905509949
"Third, if inflation is at or below zero, downward rigidities in nominal wage adjustment might induce some distortions in labor market efficiency, with unfavorable consequences for the level of employment.",2007-11-29,NEUTRAL,0.98533695936203
"In light of these considerations, as Chairman Bernanke (2007) recently noted, ""the (properly measured) long-run inflation rate that best promotes the dual mandate is likely to be low but not zero.""",2007-11-29,HAWKISH,0.9848254323005676
"The science of monetary policy has also emphasized the importance of establishing the central bank's strong and credible commitment to keeping inflation low and stable over the long run because that commitment helps to stabilize inflation expectations; in turn, stable expectations aid the functioning of the economy and the efficacy of policy.",2007-11-29,HAWKISH,0.9599200487136841
"The increased information that these projections convey regarding FOMC participants' views of the mandate-consistent inflation rate, combined with the FOMC's continuing commitment to keeping inflation low and stable, should help anchor inflation expectations even more firmly.",2007-11-29,HAWKISH,0.9925200939178467
Better information on FOMC participants' views on the mandate-consistent inflation rate is also essential for achieving the other element of the dual mandate--maximum employment.,2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.7348052859306335
"By increasing the likelihood of achieving a low and predictable inflation rate, providing information on the mandate-consistent inflation rate plays a crucial role in facilitating long-term growth in employment and labor productivity.",2007-11-29,HAWKISH,0.8859251141548157
"Furthermore, although the economy will inevitably be buffeted by various shocks, the knowledge that the monetary authority will take steps to move inflation gradually toward its mandate-consistent rate over time also helps minimize the deviations of employment and output from maximum sustainable levels.",2007-11-29,HAWKISH,0.8952234387397766
"The Longer-Term Projections for Growth and UnemploymentFor 2010, the central tendency of the range of projections for the growth of real GDP is 2.5 percent to 2.6 percent, and the projections for the unemployment rate have a central tendency of 4.7 percent to 4.9 percent.",2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.9708160758018494
The full range of FOMC participants' projections is 2.2 percent to 2.7 percent for real GDP growth and 4.6 percent to 5.0 percent for the unemployment rate.,2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.9098860621452332
"As indicated in the forecast narrative, these longer-run projections were heavily influenced by participants' assessments of the sustainable rates of output growth and employment.",2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.9556052684783936
"However, assessments of potential output growth and the sustainable unemployment rate are fundamentally different from assessments of the mandate-consistent inflation rate.",2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.9828435182571411
"In particular, as I emphasized in a speech last spring, the Federal Reserve can determine and achieve the long-run average rate of inflation in keeping with its dual mandate, but the Federal Reserve most emphatically cannot choose the level of maximum sustainable economic activity--no central bank can control the level of real economic activity or employment over the longer run (Mishkin, 2007a).",2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.9781025052070618
"In addition, the maximum sustainable levels of output and employment cannot be known with any assurance (Mishkin, 2007b).",2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.8117255568504333
The relatively narrow range of participants' longer-term projections for real GDP growth and the rate of unemployment must not be confused with the uncertainty attending those projections.,2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.966174840927124
"In that regard, macroeconometric analysis indicates that the sustainable unemployment rate and the growth rate of potential output have varied quite substantially over recent decades, thereby exacerbating the challenges of constructing estimates of these characteristics at any given point in time.",2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.9756733179092407
"For example, Staiger, Stock, and Watson (1997a,b) obtained 95 percent confidence intervals for a measure of the sustainable unemployment rate that are at least 2 percentage points wide.",2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.9542383551597595
"Thus, although FOMC participants' projections for the unemployment rate in 2010 provide information about their assessments of the sustainable unemployment rate, the analysis of Staiger, Stock, and Watson highlights the degree of uncertainty about these assessments--namely, the true value of that rate might well be as low as 3-3/4 percent or as high as 5-3/4 percent.",2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.9485435485839844
The Science of Monetary Policy and the Shorter-Term ProjectionsNow let us take a brief look at the Federal Reserve's macroeconomic projections for 2007 through 2009.,2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.9710468053817749
"These projections are useful for understanding the Federal Reserve's near-term policy strategy, and again, I would like to highlight how this strategy fulfills the dual mandate and embeds key implications of the modern science of monetary policy.",2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.8706822395324707
The science emphasizes that monetary policy makers need to think in terms of a plan for the appropriate paths for inflation and economic activity that best promotes the dual mandate of price stability and maximum sustainable employment.,2007-11-29,HAWKISH,0.8631144165992737
"If economic activity is well below its maximum sustainable level, then monetary policy should aim at increasing output and employment toward sustainable levels.",2007-11-29,NEUTRAL,0.9735655784606934
"If inflation is above the mandate-consistent rate, monetary policy should aim at reducing inflation to that rate.",2007-11-29,HAWKISH,0.9750985503196716
"Providing projections for the short run as well as for the longer run encourages FOMC participants to think in terms of desirable paths for inflation and output, a discipline that the science suggests will produce better policy outcomes.",2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.9480628371238708
"The Inflation OutlookIn the projections of FOMC participants, core inflation edges down slightly and then remains fairly stable at about 1-3/4 percent toward the end of the decade.",2007-11-29,DOVISH,0.7709560394287109
"Meanwhile, given an anticipated flattening out of energy prices, overall consumer inflation in these projections declines toward the core inflation rate; it drops from about 3 percent this year to about 2 percent in 2008 and then drops a bit further near the end of the decade.",2007-11-29,NEUTRAL,0.7717525959014893

"Important sources of restraint on inflation in the current episode have come from the decline in energy prices over 1997 and 1998; the appreciation of the dollar over the three years through mid-1998 and the resulting decline in non-oil import prices; sharper-than-previous declines in computer prices over the past three years; and a slower rate of increase in health care prices, including the cost of health care insurance.",1999-04-14,NEUTRAL,0.9420591592788696

"As a result, the challenge for monetary policy, to the extent recent U.S. performance has been driven by temporary supply shocks, is to facilitate a transition from the current exceptional but unsustainable state, to a less exceptional but more sustainable one, prior to the supply shocks dissipating or inflation increasing by an unacceptable amount.",1999-04-14,HAWKISH,0.9895511269569397
Supply-enhancing structural changes include both an apparent decline in the NAIRU (raising the sustainable level of output) and a possible increase in the trend rate of productivity growth (raising the sustainable growth rate of output).,1999-04-14,HAWKISH,0.6907915472984314

The Challenges Facing U.S. Monetary Policy I now turn to the challenge of designing a strategy for monetary policy in light of uncertainties both about the sources of recent performance and about the outlook going forward.,1999-02-25,DOVISH,0.9495355486869812
Implications of Supply Shocks and Structural Change for Monetary Policy The relative importance of supply shocks and structural change has important implications for monetary policy.,1999-02-25,DOVISH,0.9641215801239014
"For example, if the recent exceptional U.S. economic performance were entirely due to the temporary effects of favorable supply shocks, the economy's level of production might be interpreted as being beyond its sustainable capacity, with the inflationary consequences temporarily suppressed by the favorable supply shocks.",1999-02-25,NEUTRAL,0.6454657912254333
"The challenge for monetary policy would be to make the transition from the current exceptional but unsustainable state to a less exceptional but more sustainable one, prior to the supply shocks fully dissipating.",1999-02-25,HAWKISH,0.9650871753692627
"On the other hand, if the recent performance is accounted for entirely by supply-enhancing structural changes and, therefore, reflects the new, more favorable performance characteristics of the U.S. economy, the role of monetary policy is to accommodate this more favorable performance rather than to constrain it.",1999-02-25,DOVISH,0.4513598680496216
"The challenge is to set a strategy that respects this uncertainty, takes advantages of opportunities for better performance, while mitigating the risks of overtaxing the limits of sustainable production and growth.",1999-02-25,HAWKISH,0.8383078575134277
Monetary Policy Strategy: Principles and Practice Let me now turn to how U.S. monetary policy has responded during this episode and to the challenges that it faces going forward.,1999-02-25,DOVISH,0.9562940001487732
I will describe the evolution of monetary policy in relation to the strategy embodied in the Taylor Rule.,1999-02-25,DOVISH,0.9704282879829407
The Taylor Rule prescribes movements in real interest rates in response to deviations of inflation from the policymakers' inflation target and to deviations of output from its long-run potential (or to deviations in the unemployment rate from its natural rate).,1999-02-25,DOVISH,0.9808692932128906
These responses impose what I believe are the two key ingredients for a disciplined monetary policy strategy: a nominal anchor (via the inflation target) and a policy that leans against cyclical winds (via the response to changes in resource utilization rates).,1999-02-25,DOVISH,0.922417938709259
"During most of the recent episode, monetary policy broadly followed the Taylor Rule prescription, while holding the nominal federal funds rate about unchanged.",1999-02-25,DOVISH,0.9674578905105591
"Since 1995, the simultaneous declines in the unemployment rate (as a result of faster than expected growth) and lower-than-expected inflation had almost perfectly offsetting effects on the target nominal federal funds rate.",1999-02-25,NEUTRAL,0.8871461153030396
"The drop in the unemployment rate outweighed the fall in inflation in terms of the prescription for real rates, but the higher real federal funds rate prescribed by the Taylor Rule was achieved passively via declines in inflation, without the need for an increase in nominal funds rate.",1999-02-25,HAWKISH,0.635180652141571
"More recently, however, monetary policy has significantly departed from the Taylor Rule prescription.",1999-02-25,DOVISH,0.9743973016738892
"That is, the nominal funds rate today is lower than could be justified by typical Taylor Rules, given prevailing inflation and labor utilization rates.",1999-02-25,NEUTRAL,0.9781062602996826
This was intended to ensure that monetary policy and overall financial conditions remained consistent with a forecast of a benign slowdown in U.S. growth.,1999-02-25,NEUTRAL,0.5718604922294617
"Specifically, even at prevailing financial conditions, weaker foreign growth threatened to transform what was otherwise expected to be a benign slowdown into one that might be excessive, particularly given what also appeared to be asymmetrical downside risks in the global economy.",1999-02-25,NEUTRAL,0.9361017346382141
"But a forward-looking version of the Taylor Rule did, in my view, justify the policy action, at least given the revision in my own expectations for growth going forward.",1999-02-25,DOVISH,0.8284990191459656
"The third development is the reduced confidence of some (not including yours truly) in the traditional model of inflation dynamics and the appreciation by nearly everyone of increased uncertainty about the estimate of NAIRU, in response to the persistence of faster-than-expected growth and lower-than-expected inflation.",1999-02-25,NEUTRAL,0.8540377616882324
The first question is whether the degree of easing implemented in response to financial market turbulence and the abrupt downward revision in the forecast should be reassessed in light of the subsequent improvement in financial conditions and the continued robustness of domestic demand.,1999-02-25,NEUTRAL,0.44167158007621765
"Such a reassessment would, of course, also have to take into account both the incoming data on inflation and the downside risks to the U.S. economy, including those related to the continuing stresses in the global economy.",1999-02-25,DOVISH,0.7738434672355652
"In effect, uncertainty about NAIRU can be interpreted as having made monetary policy reluctant to move on the basis of declines in the unemployment rate relative to some given estimate of NAIRU.",1999-02-25,NEUTRAL,0.8442714810371399
"While this could be rationalized as an appropriate response to uncertainty about the level of NAIRU, such a strategy positions monetary policy to accommodate continued above-trend growth and further increases in labor market tightness with faster money growth, in order to preserve the prevailing level of nominal federal funds rate.",1999-02-25,HAWKISH,0.9897346496582031
"This would result in a monetary policy that reinforced rather than leaned against the cyclical winds, at least until actual price data confirmed that NAIRU had been passed.",1999-02-25,HAWKISH,0.5909740924835205
"Given that the unemployment rate is now so low relative to the range of estimates of NAIRU, and given the long lags between policy actions and the effect on inflation, continuing such an accommodative strategy would run a substantial risk of unleashing inflation pressures that would be disruptive to reverse.",1999-02-25,HAWKISH,0.9727259874343872
"This may not be an issue going forward, however, given that both the consensus and FOMC forecasts project a slowing to or below trend growth and therefore no further tightening in labor markets.",1999-02-25,NEUTRAL,0.6507866978645325
"Given the progress that has been made in reducing inflation, and the very solid economic performance that this low-inflation environment has helped to promote, a new set of issues is now emerging on the policy agenda.",1998-01-03,HAWKISH,0.970503568649292
Of mounting importance is a deeper understanding of the economic characteristics of sustained price stability.,1998-01-03,HAWKISH,0.9282276630401611
We central bankers need also to better judge how to assess our performance in achieving and maintaining that objective in light of the uncertainties surrounding the accuracy of our measured price indexes.,1998-01-03,DOVISH,0.949148952960968
"Prices of goods and services set in those markets are central guides to the efficient allocation of resources in a market economy, along with interest rates and equity values.",1998-01-03,DOVISH,0.9713901877403259
"Prices are the signals through which tastes and technology affect the decisions of consumers and producers, directing resources toward their highest valued use.",1998-01-03,DOVISH,0.9552286863327026
"Of course, this signaling process, which involves individual prices, would work with or without government statistical agencies that measure aggregate price levels, and in this sense, price measurement probably is not fundamental for the overall efficiency of the market economy.",1998-01-03,DOVISH,0.8861750364303589
"Indeed, vibrant market economies existed long before government agencies were established to measure prices.",1998-01-03,DOVISH,0.8898400664329529
"Nonetheless, in a modern monetary economy, accurate measurement of aggregate price levels is of considerable importance, increasingly so for central banks whose mandate is to maintain financial stability.",1998-01-03,HAWKISH,0.6709673404693604

"If the general price level is estimated to be rising more rapidly than is in fact the case, then we are simultaneously understating growth in real GDP and productivity, and real incomes and living standards are rising faster than our published data suggest.",1998-01-03,HAWKISH,0.9597955346107483
"Under these circumstances, policymakers must be cognizant of the shortcomings of our published price indexes to avoid actions based on inaccurate premises that will provoke undesired consequences.",1998-01-03,DOVISH,0.8178832530975342
"Clearly, central bankers need to be conscious of the problems of price measurement as we gauge policies designed to promote price stability and maximum sustainable economic growth.",1998-01-03,HAWKISH,0.9012326002120972
"Moreover, many economic transactions, both private and public, are explicitly tied to movements in some published price index, most commonly a consumer price index; and some transactions that are not explicitly tied to a published price index may, nevertheless, take such an index into account less formally.",1998-01-03,DOVISH,0.9700961709022522
"If the price index is not accurately measuring what the participants in such transactions believe it is measuring, then economic transactions will lead to suboptimal outcomes.",1998-01-03,DOVISH,0.9009164571762085
The remarkable progress that has been made by virtually all of the major industrial countries in achieving low rates of inflation in recent years has brought the issue of price measurement into especially sharp focus.,1998-01-03,HAWKISH,0.9324879050254822

"They do matter when, as now, inflation has become so low that policymakers need to consider at what point effective price stability has been reached.",1998-01-03,HAWKISH,0.9422429203987122
One use of the term refers to an ongoing fall in the prices of existing assets.,1998-01-03,NEUTRAL,0.9640402793884277
"Asset prices are inherently volatile, in part because expected returns from real assets can vary for a wide variety of reasons, some of which may be only tangentially related to the state of the economy and monetary policy.",1998-01-03,DOVISH,0.9780448079109192
"Nonetheless, a drop in the prices of existing assets can feed back onto real economic activity, not only by changing incentives to consume and invest, but also by impairing the health of financial intermediaries--as we experienced in the early 1990s and many Asian countries are learning now.",1998-01-03,NEUTRAL,0.9522485733032227
"But historically, it has been very rapid asset price declines--in equity and real estate, especially--that have held the potential to be a virulently negative force in the economy.",1998-01-03,NEUTRAL,0.9523432850837708

"The severe economic contraction of the early 1930s, and the associated persistent declines in product prices, could probably not have occurred apart from the steep asset price deflation that started in 1929.",1998-01-03,NEUTRAL,0.9893011450767517
"While asset price deflation can occur for a number of reasons, a persistent deflation in the prices of currently produced goods and services--just like a persistent increase in these prices--necessarily is, at its root, a monetary phenomenon.",1998-01-03,NEUTRAL,0.6210304498672485
"Just as changes in monetary conditions that involve a flight from money to goods cause inflation, the onset of deflation involves a flight from goods to money.",1998-01-03,DOVISH,0.8193448781967163
Both rapid or variable inflation and deflation can lead to a state of fear and uncertainty that is associated with significant increases in risk premiums and corresponding shortfalls in economic activity.,1998-01-03,HAWKISH,0.7731699347496033
"Even a moderate rate of inflation can hamper economic performance, as I have emphasized many times before; and although we do not have any recent experience, moderate rates of deflation would most probably lead to similar problems.",1998-01-03,HAWKISH,0.8492653369903564
"Deflation, like inflation, would distort resource allocation and interfere with the economy's ability to reach its full potential.",1998-01-03,NEUTRAL,0.8484864830970764

But deflation can be detrimental for reasons that go beyond those that are also associated with inflation.,1998-01-03,NEUTRAL,0.814533531665802
"Nominal interest rates are bounded at zero, hence deflation raises the possibility of potentially significant increases in real interest rates.",1998-01-03,HAWKISH,0.9547458291053772
"Some also argue that resistance to nominal wage cuts will impart an upward bias to real wages as price stability approaches or outright deflation occurs, leaving the economy with a potentially higher level of unemployment in equilibrium.",1998-01-03,NEUTRAL,0.782524049282074
"A deflation that took place in an environment of rapid productivity growth, however, might be largely immune from some of these special problems.",1998-01-03,DOVISH,0.9744535684585571
"For example, in the high-tech sector of our economy today, we observe falling prices together with rapid investment and high profitability.",1998-01-03,HAWKISH,0.581723690032959
"Although real interest rates may be quite high in terms of this sector's declining product prices, rapid productivity growth has ensured that real rates of return are higher still, and investment in this sector has been robust.",1998-01-03,HAWKISH,0.9717655777931213
"In this sense, the choice of a specific, sometimes arbitrary, definition of real output and hence of price by government statisticians is essentially a descriptive issue, and not one that directly affects firms' investment decisions.",1998-01-03,DOVISH,0.9252510070800781
This is an illustration of where even individual price measurement probably is not always of direct and fundamental importance for private sector behavior.,1998-01-03,DOVISH,0.8985442519187927
"If such high-tech, high-productivity-growth firms produce an increasing share of output in the decades ahead, then, one could readily imagine the economy experiencing an overall product price deflation in which the problems associated with a zero constraint on nominal interest rates or nominal wage changes would seldom be binding.",1998-01-03,DOVISH,0.8275532126426697
"Nevertheless, even if we could ensure significantly more rapid productivity growth than we have seen recently, there are valid reasons for wishing to avoid ongoing declines in the general price level.",1998-01-03,NEUTRAL,0.936332643032074
"If increases in both inflation and deflation raise risk premiums and retard growth, it follows that risk premiums are lowest at price stability.",1998-01-03,HAWKISH,0.9348289370536804
"Furthermore, price stability, by reducing variation in uncertainty about the future, should also reduce variations in asset values.",1998-01-03,HAWKISH,0.9355258941650391

The Short-run Effects of an Acceleration in Productivity Growth We do not have many opportunities to learn about how the economy responds to major accelerations or decelerations in productivity.,2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.9405898451805115
Figure 1 depicts the pattern in trend productivity growth from the 1960s to the first half of 2000.,2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.9199346303939819
Trend productivity growth is an estimate of how productivity growth would evolve in the absence of cyclical swings in output and employment.,2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.9376252889633179
"As you can see in figure 1, trend productivity growth in the early 1970s slowed from a 3 percent rate over the previous decade to about a 1-1/2 percent pace and remained at this lower rate until the mid-1990s.",2000-10-19,NEUTRAL,0.550815761089325
"At that point, productivity sharply accelerated.",2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.6559654474258423
The figure undoubtedly overstates the abruptness of the decline in the early 1970s and the constancy of trend productivity on either side of this point and oversimplifies the pattern of acceleration since the mid-1990s.,2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.7820913195610046
In figure 1 the pattern of acceleration is simply a straight line from the earlier period of low productivity growth to an upper-end estimate of trend productivity today.,2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.5977008938789368
But the important message in both figures is that there have been two dramatic and persistent changes in trend productivity growth during the postwar period--the deceleration in the early 1970s and the acceleration in the mid-1990s.,2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.9123448133468628
Economists don't agree yet on how much productivity has accelerated.,2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.8291304707527161

"Specifically, they added to the increase in growth in real activity and were the source of simultaneous declines in unemployment and core inflation during much of this period.",2000-10-19,HAWKISH,0.6871398687362671
These developments have created a powerful set of crosscurrents that challenge monetary policymakers.,2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.9319800734519958
The demand effect refers to the stimulus to aggregate demand from the forces that underlie the acceleration in productivity.,2000-10-19,HAWKISH,0.5203683376312256
"The boom was triggered by the profitable opportunities associated with exploiting the new technologies, by the associated declines in the relative prices of high-tech equipment, and by the decline in the cost of financing high-tech investments as a result of higher equity prices.",2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.4876307249069214
The information technology revolution also set off a consumption boom triggered by the wealth effect associated with higher equity prices and by a projected higher path of labor income.,2000-10-19,HAWKISH,0.7259984016418457

The demand and direct disinflationary effects have conflicting implications for inflation.,2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.9263139963150024
"The above-trend growth associated with the demand effect lowers the unemployment rate, and the tighter labor market puts upward pressure on inflation.",2000-10-19,HAWKISH,0.9827175736427307
"The direct disinflationary effect, on the other hand, lowers inflation for any given unemployment rate.",2000-10-19,NEUTRAL,0.562466025352478

"And, of course, the appropriate course of monetary policy depends on the balance between these two effects.2 The interaction of these two short-run effects can also be explained in terms of the relationship between the unemployment rate and the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU).",2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.9512850046157837
The NAIRU is the unemployment rate consistent with steady inflation.,2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.9229159355163574
"In computing the NAIRU, the customary practice is to abstract from shocks that directly affect inflation over and above the influence of demand pressure--for example, accelerations or decelerations in trend productivity and swings in the relative price of oil are not taken into consideration.",2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.965906023979187
"In fact, if there were no shocks, the direction of inflation ultimately would be uniquely determined by the relationship between the unemployment rate and the NAIRU.",2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.9767617583274841
"But, of course, additional shocks almost always directly affect inflation, most often on the supply side of the economy.",2000-10-19,HAWKISH,0.9605603218078613

"That is, the direct disinflationary effect lowers the short-run NAIRU relative to its long-run value.",2000-10-19,NEUTRAL,0.9732294082641602
Whether or not inflation will rise or fall in the immediate aftermath of an acceleration in productivity cannot be judged therefore by comparing the actual unemployment rate to the estimate of the long-run NAIRU.,2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.9735656976699829
The relevant comparison is between the current unemployment rate and an estimate of the short-run NAIRU that takes into account the disinflationary effect of the productivity shock.,2000-10-19,NEUTRAL,0.9407510161399841
My preference is to estimate a short-run NAIRU that directly takes into account the disinflationary effect of an acceleration in productivity because the effects of an acceleration in productivity on inflation may persist long enough that the adjusted NAIRU might be useful in policy decisions.,2000-10-19,NEUTRAL,0.5665143728256226
"On the other hand, I would leave out of such an estimation the effect of swings in oil prices, for example, because their effect on inflation dissipates more quickly.",2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.9476036429405212
"The demand and direct disinflationary effects are both temporary, but the period over which each has its influence depends on different considerations.",2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.9090176820755005
"The persistence of the demand effect depends on how long it takes for business capital stocks to adjust to higher expected profitability, for consumer durables to adjust to higher wealth and higher projected future income, and for market interest rates to close the gap relative to the higher equilibrium real interest rate.",2000-10-19,HAWKISH,0.9032881855964661
"The direct disinflationary effect of an acceleration in productivity is, in my view, temporary because it likely arises from the lag in the adjustment of nominal wages to the productivity acceleration.",2000-10-19,NEUTRAL,0.8192303776741028
It dissipates gradually once productivity growth stabilizes and nominal wages catch up to the productivity acceleration.,2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.8466865420341492
How rapidly this effect dissipates depends on how quickly productivity growth stabilizes and how rapidly nominal wage gains adjust to the higher productivity growth.,2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.7662814259529114
A similar sluggish adjustment of nominal wages to productivity developments following the productivity slowdown in the early 1970s may have contributed to the sharp increase in inflation thereafter.3 Let me try to make a rough estimate of the direct disinflationary effect of the acceleration in productivity and the associated decline in the short-run NAIRU.,2000-10-19,HAWKISH,0.6078762412071228
The first step is to estimate the acceleration in trend productivity.,2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.5601791739463806
If productivity has increased from 1-1/2 percent during the period from the early 1970s to the mid-1990s to the upper end of the estimate today--say 3-1/2 percent--then the total acceleration in productivity would be 2 percentage points.,2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.5004042387008667
"If nominal wages do not immediately respond, the growth in labor costs will fall by precisely the same amount as the increase in the growth of labor productivity.",2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.572147786617279
"In this case, the direct disinflationary effect simply equals the acceleration in productivity.",2000-10-19,NEUTRAL,0.7991390824317932
"However, the magnitude of the direct effect will diminish over time as wage growth catches up to the faster productivity growth, unless of course productivity continues to accelerate, as has been the case over the last several years.",2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.6234655380249023
"Because wages have likely already partially adjusted to the cumulative increase in productivity growth during the last several years, the portion of the acceleration still putting downward pressure on inflation may be somewhat less than 2 percentage points.",2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.7643315196037292
A simple way of judging the magnitude of the direct disinflationary effect is to calculate the difference between the current estimate of trend productivity and a moving average of this trend.,2000-10-19,NEUTRAL,0.9828181266784668
The length of the moving average should be an estimate of the time it takes for nominal wages to fully respond to higher productivity growth.,2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.5200211405754089
"In figure 2, I plot a measure of the direct disinflationary effect using a forty-quarter moving average of trend productivity.",2000-10-19,NEUTRAL,0.9587207436561584
A ten-year moving average probably provides an upper end of the estimate of the direct disinflationary effect.,2000-10-19,NEUTRAL,0.9588425159454346
"As you can see, this upper-end estimate is that the cumulative productivity acceleration is lowering inflation today by 1-1/2 percentage points, for any given unemployment rate.",2000-10-19,HAWKISH,0.8488675951957703
"Note that when this effect is positive, as it has been since the mid-1990s, it is a disinflationary effect and when it is negative--as it was following the decline in trend productivity growth after the early 1970s--it is an inflationary effect.",2000-10-19,HAWKISH,0.5240471363067627
The power and persistence of the direct disinflationary effect depends on both the pattern of the productivity acceleration and the speed of the adjustment process--specifically how fast wages respond directly to the productivity acceleration.,2000-10-19,NEUTRAL,0.962795078754425
"If the adjustment is very drawn out as shown in figure 2, then the direct disinflationary effect would have been quite large and this effect would continue to be important for some time, even once productivity growth stabilizes.",2000-10-19,NEUTRAL,0.9792004823684692
"But if the adjustment were more rapid, the disinflationary effects of the acceleration in productivity would have been less powerful and would dissipate more rapidly once productivity growth stabilizes.",2000-10-19,NEUTRAL,0.4398104250431061
These alternative moving averages translate into a range of 1/2 to 1-1/2 percentage points for the direct disinflationary effect of the acceleration in productivity growth.,2000-10-19,NEUTRAL,0.9641531705856323
"In figure 3, I have assumed that the long-run NAIRU is 5-1/2 percent and that the long-run NAIRU has varied over the period from 1960 until today only in response to the effect of demographic changes on the average unemployment rate.4 As I explain in somewhat more detail in the appendix, I estimate the short-run NAIRU by subtracting the direct disinflationary effect of changes in trend productivity from the estimate of the long-run NAIRU.",2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.963764488697052
This has the convenient property that the bottom end of the range is consistent with the prevailing unemployment rate and would support the view that we might be approaching a type of soft landing--a convergence of growth to trend at a point when the unemployment rate is already at the short-run NAIRU.,2000-10-19,NEUTRAL,0.8699223399162292
"In this case, there would not be any immediate upward pressure on core inflation.",2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.7642362117767334
"The range also has the property that its mid-point value of the short-run is above the prevailing unemployment rate, implying some upward pressure on core inflation over the near term.",2000-10-19,HAWKISH,0.9746593236923218
The Favorable Policy Choice as the Economy Adjusts to an Acceleration in Productivity Policymakers face a choice when confronted with an acceleration in productivity--a choice among very favorable outcomes.,2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.6891437768936157

"It depends on policymakers' preferences, as well as on where inflation is relative to policymakers' long-run inflation goal at the outset of the acceleration in productivity.",2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.9666293859481812
The outcome also likely will depend on how quickly policymakers realize that productivity has accelerated and learn how the economy responds to this development.,2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.7989092469215393
The response of monetary policy to the acceleration in productivity determines this choice.,2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.7612746357917786
How have the benefits of the acceleration in productivity been taken in this episode?,2000-10-19,HAWKISH,0.4512942135334015
"To assess the outcome, it is most useful to look at the pattern of core measures of consumer price inflation--specifically measures of inflation based on the core PCE and the core CPI--during this period.",2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.9293383955955505
I interpret the evidence as suggesting that we have taken a large part of the benefits of the acceleration in productivity in temporarily higher output and a smaller portion in the form of lower inflation.,2000-10-19,NEUTRAL,0.42693188786506653
"But let me emphasize again that the outcome of this choice is not simply a reflection of policymakers preferences, but also of how quickly the policymakers came to understand the size of the productivity acceleration and how it was affecting the choices they face.",2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.37862393260002136
The Monetary Policy Response: The Two-step There is considerable uncertainty today about the NAIRU.,2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.8611172437667847

"At the risk of some oversimplification, recent monetary policy could be viewed as part of a two-step strategy that takes into account the uncertainty about the NAIRU.",2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.8842194676399231
The first step is to slow the growth in real output to trend to stabilize the unemployment rate at the lower end of the range of estimates of the short-run NAIRU.,2000-10-19,NEUTRAL,0.9508301615715027
"Thereafter comes step two, which is to apply a more reactive and less pre-emptive monetary policy.",2000-10-19,HAWKISH,0.5404337048530579

"If not, then monetary policy would respond to higher inflation by raising real interest rates.",2000-10-19,HAWKISH,0.9573883414268494
"That is, even if the unemployment rate today is consistent with the short-run NAIRU, the short-run NAIRU may have to rise over time as it converges toward the long-run NAIRU, at least once productivity growth stabilizes (or increases in productivity growth slow by a sufficient amount).",2000-10-19,NEUTRAL,0.7086336612701416
A Transition to Below-Trend Growth and Rising Inflation?,2000-10-19,HAWKISH,0.8668678402900696
"From the end of 1995 until mid-2000, growth had been above trend and, as a result, the unemployment rate had been declining.",2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.7267306447029114
"For much of the period, core inflation was declining.",2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.5532509088516235

"The consensus private-sector forecast is for the growth in real GDP to slip below trend in the third quarter, then post a modest rebound in the fourth quarter, and continue in 2001 at a pace that will keep the unemployment rate nearly steady.",2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.9214286208152771
"The consensus forecast also appears to be consistent with relatively stable core inflation, implying that the prevailing unemployment rate may be sustainable and that monetary policy may have succeeded in achieving a soft landing.",2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.8504095077514648
"If so, monetary policy would have achieved a soft landing for the second time in the same expansion--a truly extraordinary feat.",2000-10-19,DOVISH,0.6922072768211365
"Even if growth in real GDP remains at or modestly below trend for a period, there are, in my view, two potential sources of upward pressure on inflation over the next few years.",2000-10-19,HAWKISH,0.9660648703575134
The first is the possibility that the unemployment rate today is below the short-run NAIRU.,2000-10-19,HAWKISH,0.6676489114761353
"The central tendency for my estimate of the short-run NAIRU, for example, is above the prevailing unemployment rate, suggesting the potential for some upward creep on core inflation.",2000-10-19,HAWKISH,0.9742254018783569
The second source of higher inflation would be the gradual convergence of the short-run NAIRU to the long-run NAIRU should productivity growth stabilize and the direct disinflationary effect wane.,2000-10-19,HAWKISH,0.6816661357879639

"""9 In practice, however, the adoption of targets for money and credit growth was evidently not effective in constraining policy or in reducing inflation, in part because the target was not routinely achieved.10 The closest the Federal Reserve came to a ""monetarist experiment"" began in October 1979, when the FOMC under Chairman Paul Volcker adopted an operating procedure based on the management of non-borrowed reserves.11 The intent was to focus policy on controlling the growth of M1 and M2 and thereby to reduce inflation, which had been running at double-digit rates.",2006-11-10,HAWKISH,0.5086516737937927
