"According to van Ark and Inklaar, some of the differential reflects faster capital deepening in the United States, but much of it reflects a surge in multifactor productivity growth in the United States outside of the IT sector since 2000.4 Innovations in information technology, however, cannot be the whole story--flexibility at the firm level and in labor markets, and competitive pressure throughout the economy, also play their roles.5 Businesses must be flexible enough to adopt new technologies and then to transform themselves in ways that allow technology-intensive investment to have the highest possible effect on productivity growth.",2006-09-27,STABLE,0.8908084630966187

"Second, underlying trend inflation appears to be somewhat below the Committee's 2 percent objective, according to various statistical filters.4 The near decade of inflation persistently short of 2 percent creates the risk that households and businesses come to expect inflation to run persistently below target and change their behavior in a way that fulfills that expectation, which greatly complicates the task of monetary policy.",2020-09-01,NO-EFFECT,0.9961909055709839

"Instead of an aggregate ""normal"" unemployment rate, the Committee's commitment to defining the maximum level of employment as a broad-based and inclusive goal, together with our continued commitment to consider a wide range of indicators, may be particularly significant for the groups that are most vulnerable to employment fluctuations.8 Both research and experience suggest the groups that face the greatest structural challenges in the labor market are likely to be the first to experience layoffs during downturns and the last to experience employment gains during recoveries.",2020-09-01,NO-EFFECT,0.9057034254074097
"Research by the Federal Reserve Board staff finds that unemployment rates, as well as patterns of job loss and labor force entry and exit, are more cyclically sensitive for Blacks and Hispanics than for whites, and observable worker characteristics can explain very little of these differentials.9 A similar observation was one of the key takeaways from the Fed Listens sessions we held around the country.10 Juan Salgado, chancellor of the City Colleges of Chicago, described how last year's tight labor market was finally giving his students, who are largely Black and Latinx, the opportunity to apprentice with local businesses in jobs that historically have not been open to them.11 Moreover, earnings from wages are particularly important for these groups, who have large and persistent wealth gaps and derive a smaller share of their income from financial asset holdings or from business ownership.12 Second, to address the downward bias to inflation associated with the proximity to the effective lower bound, the statement adopts a flexible inflation averaging strategy that seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time in order to ensure longer-term inflation expectations are well anchored at 2 percent.",2020-09-01,NO-EFFECT,0.494169145822525

Productivity Resurgence and Its CausesWhat underlies the resurgence in U.S. productivity growth?,2006-08-31,STABLE,0.9231376051902771
Explanations of the rise in productivity growth since about 1995 have evolved somewhat over time.,2006-08-31,STABLE,0.942881166934967
"By 2000 or so, an emerging consensus held that the pickup in productivity growth was, for the most part, the product of both rapid technological progress and increased investment in new information and communication technologies (IT) during the 1990s (see Jorgenson and Stiroh, 2000, and Oliner and Sichel, 2000).",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.9682464003562927
"According to this view, developments in IT promoted U.S. productivity growth in two ways.",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.9119665026664734
"First, technological advances allowed the IT-producing sectors themselves to exhibit rapid productivity growth.",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.919013261795044
Both the more-rapid pace of production and the higher average quality of output raised productivity at Intel as well as at competing firms that were forced to keep pace.,2006-08-31,STABLE,0.6064364314079285
"Second, advances in information technology also promoted productivity growth outside the IT-producing sector, as firms in a wide range of industries expanded their investments in high-tech equipment and software and used the new technologies to reduce costs and increase quality.",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.8337211012840271
"Some large retailers, for example, developed IT-based tools to improve the management of their supply chains and to increase their responsiveness to changes in the level and mix of customer demands.",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.7802760601043701
Securities brokers and dealers achieved substantial productivity gains by automating their trading processes and their back-office operations.,2006-08-31,STABLE,0.9150764346122742
"One study (Stiroh, 2002) found that a majority of U.S. industries experienced an acceleration of productivity in the latter part of the 1990s.",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.9561218619346619
"Undoubtedly, the IT revolution and the resurgence of productivity in the United States after 1995 were closely connected.",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.9307675957679749
"However, the technology-based explanation of increased productivity growth does raise a couple of puzzles (see, for example, McKinsey and Company, 2001 and 2005, and Basu and others, 2003).",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.9163188934326172
"Yet, with a few exceptions, the available data show that productivity growth in other advanced countries has not increased to the extent seen in the United States.",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.6846661567687988
"Second, as I have noted, productivity growth increased very rapidly earlier this decade and has continued to rise at a solid pace, even though IT investment declined sharply after the stock prices of high-tech firms plummeted in 2000.",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.8943087458610535
"More generally, as a historical matter, increases in IT investment have not always been followed in short order by increases in productivity growth.",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.8187833428382874
"This observation raises the question of why, in some cases, the putative productivity benefits of investments in new technologies do not occur until years after those investments are made.",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.9450750350952148
In regard to the first puzzle--the fact that the United States has enjoyed greater productivity growth in recent years than other advanced countries--the comparison with Europe is particularly interesting.,2006-08-31,STABLE,0.8894073367118835
"Throughout most of the post-World War II period, productivity growth in Europe exceeded that in the United States, at first because of the rapid gains during the postwar reconstruction and then later because of a gradual convergence of European technology and business practices to American standards.",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.9055019617080688
"By one estimate, European productivity increased from 44 percent of the U.S. level in 1950 to near-equality with the United States by 1995 (Gordon, 2004 and 2006).",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.9666908979415894
"However, the available data suggest that, since about 1995, productivity growth in European nations has slowed, on average, in contrast to the pickup experienced in the United States.",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.72627192735672
"These trends have led to an increasing divergence in productivity levels in the United States and Europe (see van Ark and Inklaar, 2005).",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.733953595161438
"Researchers have made the important point that differences in productivity growth between the United States and Europe appear not to have been particularly large in the IT-producing sectors, where U.S. strengths in the development of computers and semiconductors have been partly offset by European leadership in communications.",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.9491293430328369
Differences in economic policies and systems likely have accounted for some of the differences in the performance of productivity.,2006-08-31,STABLE,0.9545032382011414
"One leading explanation for the strong U.S. productivity growth is that labor markets in the United States tend to be more flexible and competitive, market characteristics that have allowed the United States to realize greater economic benefits from new technologies.",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.907670795917511
"For example, some economists have argued that restrictions on land use and on shopping hours in Europe have impeded the development of ""big box"" retail outlets, reducing competition and denying European firms the economies of scale that have been important for productivity growth in the retail sector in the United States (Gordon, 2004).",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.7904686331748962
"Also, although it is not a feature unique to the United States, the increasing degree of openness of our economy to trade and foreign investment and the consequent exposure of U.S. companies to the rigors of international as well as domestic competition, may have promoted productivity growth.2 As a leading example, productivity gains in U.S. manufacturing--which is particularly subject to international competition--have been especially impressive in recent years, averaging, by one measure, about 6 percent per year over the past decade.3 A number of other explanations have been advanced for the relatively stronger performance of productivity in the United States in recent years, including international differences in management practices, the depth and sophistication of U.S. capital markets, more favorable attitudes toward competition and entrepreneurship in the United States, and the role of U.S. research universities in fostering innovation.4 Further study of national productivity differentials clearly is warranted.",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.9123105406761169
"The second productivity puzzle relates to the further acceleration in productivity that occurred earlier in this decade despite the decline in IT investment after 2000 and the rather modest recovery in recent years.5 Again, a number of explanations have been proposed, including business restructuring and an even more rapid pace of technical change and of the diffusion of technological advances.",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.8971410393714905
"It is interesting, however, that the recent episode is not the first time that we have seen productivity improvements lagging well behind investments in new technology.",2006-08-31,NO-EFFECT,0.5508554577827454
"Notably, computers were first commercialized in the 1950s, and personal computers began to come into widespread use in the early 1980s; but until the mid-1990s, these developments had little evident effect on measures of productivity.",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.9414699077606201
"Indeed, an oft-quoted quip by economist Robert Solow held that, as of the late 1980s, ""computers are everywhere except in the productivity statistics.""",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.9776444435119629
"In attempting to explain the tendency of productivity growth to lag behind investments in new technologies, economists have emphasized that much more than the purchase of new high-tech equipment is needed to achieve significant gains in productivity.",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.9166037440299988
"Case studies of individual industries show that the planning for technological modernization has not always been adequate, with the result that some purchases of high-tech equipment and software have not added much to productivity or profits.",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.8656675815582275
"Second, firmsâ€™ need to invest in intangible capital--and thus to divert resources from the production of market goods or services--helps to explain why measured output and productivity may decline or grow slowly during the period after firms adopt new technologies.",2006-08-31,NO-EFFECT,0.6217635273933411
"Finally, the concept of intangible capital may shed light on the puzzle of why productivity growth has remained strong despite the deceleration in IT investment.",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.7148740887641907
"Because investments in high-tech capital typically require complementary investments in intangible capital for productivity gains to be realized, the benefits of high-tech investment may become visible only after an extended period during which firms are making the necessary investments in intangibles.",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.5254526138305664
"Longer-Term Prospects for Productivity GrowthHistorical analyses of the sources of fluctuations in productivity growth are challenging, but not nearly so challenging as trying to predict how productivity will evolve in the future.",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.9339342713356018
"However, because the rate of productivity growth is a primary determinant of economic performance, policymakers have few options other than to try to forecast future gains in productivity.",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.7599906325340271
"For example, estimates of long-term productivity growth are needed to determine the rate of output growth that the economy can sustain in the long run without generating inflationary pressures.",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.9387266635894775
"The task of trying to predict the behavior of productivity in the medium-to-long run is complicated by the fact that productivity growth generally varies with the business cycle, tending to be below its longer-term trend when the economy is contracting and above that trend when the economy is in the early stages of an expansion (see Basu and Fernald, 2001, for a discussion).",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.8679531812667847
"(This well-documented pattern makes the strong growth of productivity during the early part of this decade, a period that featured a recession and generally slow growth, all the more remarkable.)",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.9198993444442749
Economists use statistical methods to try to abstract from cyclical influences to determine the longer-term trend in productivity.,2006-08-31,STABLE,0.9463842511177063
"As of a couple of years ago, the consensus among leading researchers was that productivity in the nonfarm business sector was likely to grow at about 2-1/2 percent per year in the longer term, close to the rate of productivity growth achieved during the 1995 to 2000 period (see, for example, Baily, 2003; Gordon, 2003; and Jorgenson, Ho, and Stiroh, 2004).",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.9262688159942627
"On the one hand, recent data revisions to the national income and product accounts have shown that productivity growth over the past few years was slightly weaker than we thought, leading some analysts to revise down their estimates of trend productivity growth about 1/4 percentage point or so per year.",2006-08-31,NO-EFFECT,0.914935290813446

"On net, the recent experience does not appear to require a significant rethinking of long-term productivity trends.",2006-08-31,STABLE,0.865675687789917
"Indeed, recent estimates by leading economists continue to peg the expected longer-term rate of productivity growth at roughly 2-1/2 percent per year.7 Of course, as the saying goes, past returns do not guarantee future results, and not all the evidence supports this optimistic view of productivity trends.",2006-08-31,NO-EFFECT,0.6137840151786804

The Decline in Long-Term Interest Rates and the Role of Monetary Policy One of the most remarkable and fundamental changes in the global financial landscape over the past three decades has been the steady and significant decline in global sovereign bond yields.,2019-11-12,STABLE,0.8927247524261475
"To understand and interpret this decline, it is useful to think of the yield on a nominal 10-year bond as the sum of two components: investors' expectation over the next 10 years of the average level of short-term interest rates plus a term premium.",2019-11-12,STABLE,0.9007220268249512
The term premium is the additional compensationâ€”relative to investing in and rolling over short-maturity billsâ€”that bondholders require for assuming the risk of holding a long-duration asset with greater exposure to interest rate and inflation volatility.,2019-11-12,STABLE,0.8270782232284546
"In this case, which is relevant today in the United States and some other countries, the exposure to interest rate and inflation volatility embedded in a long-maturity bond is more than offset by the potential value of the bond in hedging other risks, such as equity risk.2 The expectation of the average level of future short-term interest rates can, in turn, be decomposed into the expectation of average future real interest rates and the expectation of average future inflation rates.",2019-11-12,STABLE,0.8512203693389893
"Performing this standard decomposition reveals that the decline in long-term rates reflects declines in all three components: expected real rates, expected inflation, and the term premium (figure 2, ""Yield Decomposition"").",2019-11-12,STABLE,0.6109286546707153
"With respect to expected real short-term interest rates, one reason investors expect lower future short-term interest rates is that neutral interest rates appear to have declined worldwide and are expected to remain low.",2019-11-12,NO-EFFECT,0.9007092714309692
This concept of a neutral level for short-term real interest rates is referred to in the academic literature as r* and corresponds to the rate consistent with a level of aggregate demand equal to and growing in pace with aggregate supply at an unchanged rate of inflation.,2019-11-12,STABLE,0.9335744380950928
"Policymakers and academics alike, including myself, have spent considerable time exploring the reasons for and ramifications of the decline in r* across countries.3 For example, many have pointed to slowing population growth and a moderation in the pace of technological change as consistent with a lower level of r*.4 Changes in risk tolerance and regulations have led to an increase in savings and in the demand for safe assets, pushing down yields on sovereign bonds.5 Importantly, economic theory suggests and empirical research confirms that there is a significant common global component embedded in individual country r*s (figure 3, ""Estimates of r*"").6 This common factor driving individual country r*s not only reflects the influence of common global shocks affecting all economies in a similar way (for example, a slowdown in global productivity and the demographics associated with aging), but also results from international capital flows that respond to and, over time, tend to narrow divergences in rates of return offered across different countries.",2019-11-12,NO-EFFECT,0.7499068379402161
"In addition to the decline in r* around the world, lower long-term bond yields also reflect the influence of the initial downshift and ultimate anchoring of inflation expectations in many countries after the mid-1990s.",2019-11-12,NO-EFFECT,0.606427013874054
"Unlike the decline in r*, which primarily reflects fundamental ""real"" factors that are outside the control of a central bank, the decline and ultimate anchoring of inflation and inflation expectations in both major and many emerging economies were the direct consequence of the widespread adoption and commitment to transparent, flexible inflation-targeting monetary policy strategies.",2019-11-12,STABLE,0.8347030878067017
"For example, in the United States, after the collapse of Bretton Woods, inflation spiraled upward, hitting double-digit rates in the 1970s and early 1980s.",2019-11-12,STABLE,0.8369238376617432

"Following the 1990â€“91 recession, inflation fell further, and, by the mid-1990s, the conditions for price stability in the United States had been achieved (thank you, Alan Greenspan).",2019-11-12,STABLE,0.9141952395439148

Many major emerging market economies as well have seen a remarkable and very welcome decline in average inflation rates as a result of adopting and delivering on credible inflation-targeting polices.,2019-11-12,STABLE,0.7514901757240295

What has been behind this global decline in inflation volatility?,2019-11-12,STABLE,0.8528044819831848
"I would argue, as have many others, that monetary policy played a key role in reducing not only the average rate of inflation, but also the volatility of inflation.7 Inflation-targeting monetary policy can plausibly influence the variance of inflation through several channels.",2019-11-12,STABLE,0.951218843460083
"For example, in a textbook DSGE (dynamic stochastic general equilibrium) model (Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (CGG), 1999) featuring a central bank that implements policy via a Taylor-type rule, the equilibrium variance of inflation will be lower the more aggressively the central bank leans against exogenous shocks that push inflation away from target.",2019-11-12,STABLE,0.9397972822189331
"So even if the variance of inflation shocks is constant, the variance of inflation itself will be an endogenous function of monetary policy.",2019-11-12,STABLE,0.9293105006217957
Another related channel through which monetary policy can influence the variance of inflation is by changing the equilibrium persistence of inflation deviations from target.,2019-11-12,STABLE,0.8749812245368958
"In the textbook CGG model (1999), augmented with a hybrid Phillips curve that features an inertial backward-looking component, the equilibrium persistence of inflation is an endogenous function of the monetary policy rule such that the more aggressively the central bank leans against exogenous shocks that push inflation away from target, the less persistent are inflation deviations from target in equilibrium.",2019-11-12,STABLE,0.9423104524612427
"In the simple case in which equilibrium inflation is a first-order autoregressive process (as it is in the CGG (1999) model under optimal policy), the equilibrium unconditional variance of inflation is monotonic in inflation persistence for any given constant variance of inflation shocks.",2019-11-12,STABLE,0.9759950041770935
"Of course, non-monetary factors may also have contributed to a lower variance of inflation.",2019-11-12,STABLE,0.8553706407546997

"Decomposing the factors that drive equilibrium term premiums is an active area of academic research, and I will not attempt to summarize or synthesize this vast literature.8 But I would like to emphasize what seems to me to be three contributors to the decline in the term premium in the United States and perhaps in other countries as well.9 First, the decline in inflation volatility has almost certainly been important in driving the term premium on nominal bonds lower.",2019-11-12,STABLE,0.8210633993148804
"The real ex-post payoff from holding a nominal bond to maturity is directly exposed to price-level risk, and thus, all else being equal, a decline in inflation volatility makes the real purchasing power of the bond's payoff less risky.",2019-11-12,STABLE,0.48967793583869934
"Through this channel, the decline in inflation volatility should be reflected in a smaller inflation risk premium in nominal bond yields, which is exactly what is estimated in the Kim, Walsh, and Wei (2019) yield curve model (figure 4, ""Term Premium Decomposition"").",2019-11-12,STABLE,0.6518606543540955
"Indeed, this yield curve model attributes around 100 basis points of the decline in the U.S. 10-year nominal term premium since the early 1990s to a decline in the inflation risk premium.",2019-11-12,STABLE,0.9321801662445068
A third contributor to a lower U.S. term premium is much less widely appreciated than lower inflation volatility and LSAPs.,2019-11-12,STABLE,0.9012941718101501
"As such, we would expect the equilibrium yield on bonds to be lower than otherwise, as investors should bid up their price to reflect their value as a hedge against equity risk (relative to their value when the bond beta to stocks was positive).",2019-11-12,NO-EFFECT,0.9833683371543884
"This paper develops and estimates a habit persistence consumption asset pricing model in which the sign of the equilibrium covariance between equity and bond returns depends on the reduced-form correlation between inflation and the output gap, the correlation between the federal funds rate and the output gap, as well as the equilibrium persistence of inflation.",2019-11-12,STABLE,0.9572564959526062

"I, myself, believe that the change in the U.S. monetary policy regime that began in 1979 under Paul Volcker and that was extended by Alan Greenspan in the 1990s very likely contributed to the change in the sign of the correlation between inflation and the output gap as well as the change in sign of the correlation between the federal funds rate and the output gap that we observe in the data (Clarida, Galí, and Gertler, 2000).",2019-11-12,STABLE,0.927089273929596

"Using the neoclassical model, and disaggregating capital into information and communications technology and other capital, Dan Sichel and Steve Oliner of the Board staff decomposed productivity growth into contributions from capital deepening (the growth arising from an increase in the ratio of capital to labor) and multifactor productivity growth (the growth in output that cannot be accounted for by increases in labor and capital inputs) and into the contributions from the use of information technology and from increased efficiency in the production of computers.",2000-06-06,STABLE,0.9585356116294861

So let me count the ways that supply and demand help us to understand the recent experience and the challenges facing monetary policy today.,2000-06-06,STABLE,0.9168828725814819
"First, a productivity shock affects aggregate demand as well as potential supply and may initially have an even larger effect on demand than on supply.",2000-06-06,NO-EFFECT,0.8858518004417419
"In early discussions about the productivity shock, the emphasis was, not surprisingly, exclusively on its supply-side implications--specifically a faster rate of productivity growth and hence of sustainable GDP growth.",2000-06-06,STABLE,0.8168208599090576
The natural corollary seemed to be that a faster growth of supply than of demand would be a powerful disinflationary force.,2000-06-06,STABLE,0.5472392439842224
"But during the period over which productivity has accelerated, demand has grown faster than potential supply.",2000-06-06,STABLE,0.5106696486473083
"The demand effects--to the extent that they are directly related to the productivity shock--likely reflect the more favorable investment opportunities, the effect of expected profitability on equity prices and hence household wealth and consumption, and the effect of the increase in expected future labor income on current consumption.",2000-06-06,STABLE,0.7894683480262756
"Demand, it appears, received an additional boost over this period from a run-up in equity prices that the higher productivity growth alone could not fully account for.",2000-06-06,NO-EFFECT,0.6088612079620361
"The balance between supply and demand can be inferred from movements in utilization rates, specifically in the unemployment rate.",2000-06-06,STABLE,0.9079123735427856
"When actual output is expanding at the same pace as potential, the unemployment rate will be stable.",2000-06-06,STABLE,0.8929380178451538
"When output growth outpaces the growth of potential, the unemployment rate declines.",2000-06-06,STABLE,0.9025083780288696
And the unemployment rate has declined almost 0.4 percentage points a year for the past four years.,2000-06-06,STABLE,0.8867633938789368
This translates into excess demand growth of 0.75 to 1 percentage point relative to potential supply growth.,2000-06-06,STABLE,0.8670378923416138
The second insight--and enduring old economy wisdom--is that a proximate source of changes in inflation is an imbalance between the levels of aggregate supply and aggregate demand.,2000-06-06,STABLE,0.9345515966415405
This can be expressed as an imbalance between actual and potential output or as a divergence of the unemployment rate from the NAIRU.,2000-06-06,STABLE,0.8603160381317139
"The imbalance between the growth rates of aggregate supply and demand is, of course, the source of changes in the balance between the levels of aggregate demand and supply.",2000-06-06,STABLE,0.9088041186332703
But inflation is related directly to the levels not to the growth imbalance.,2000-06-06,STABLE,0.8110008239746094
"And, even in the new economy, excess aggregate demand ultimately drives up inflation.",2000-06-06,STABLE,0.8224503397941589
Do we have excess aggregate demand?,2000-06-06,STABLE,0.8949224948883057

"This uncertainty has been, in my view, an important consideration in the way monetary policy has responded to recent economic developments.",2000-06-06,STABLE,0.682357668876648
"Obviously, whether the NAIRU is closer to 4 percent or to 5 percent affects the difficulty associated with rebalancing supply and demand to contain the risk of higher inflation.",2000-06-06,STABLE,0.6143486499786377
But why has inflation remained moderate if there is persistent excess demand in the labor market?,2000-06-06,STABLE,0.651772677898407
This is still another supply and demand story.,2000-06-06,STABLE,0.8154914379119873
The economy is subject to two fundamental types of aggregate economic shocks: supply shocks and demand shocks.,2000-06-06,STABLE,0.9411299824714661
These two types of shocks give rise to different challenges for monetary policy.,2000-06-06,STABLE,0.9117833375930786
Supply shocks come in two varieties: relative price shocks (such as changes in the relative price of oil) and productivity shocks.,2000-06-06,STABLE,0.9176502227783203
"Earlier in this episode, the economy benefited from a series of favorable relative price shocks and, throughout the last several years, has been adjusting to an increase in productivity growth.",2000-06-06,STABLE,0.8483073711395264
Both of these developments have had a temporary disinflationary effect.,2000-06-06,STABLE,0.65292888879776
"Together they suppressed inflation for a while, countering the potential inflationary consequences of the progressive increase in aggregate demand relative to potential supply.",2000-06-06,STABLE,0.8167219161987305

The disinflationary effect of an increase in productivity growth begins to dissipate once productivity growth stabilizes at a higher level.,2000-06-06,STABLE,0.7615348696708679
"So unless productivity accelerates further, its disinflationary effect should continue to erode for a time.",2000-06-06,NO-EFFECT,0.9447645545005798
"When favorable supply shocks dominate, growth in demand is stimulated and utilization rates rise, but inflation tends to moderate.",2000-06-06,STABLE,0.6456558704376221
"The result is offsetting implications for the setting of the nominal funds rate and, thus, monetary policy may be left with little work to do.",2000-06-06,NO-EFFECT,0.4837493896484375

A Brief Inflation Report But is there any evidence that inflation pressures are in fact building?,2000-06-06,STABLE,0.7491869330406189
"Of course, overall inflation has clearly increased significantly over the last year.",2000-06-06,STABLE,0.7159315943717957

Similar trends are evident in the PCE and in the GDP price index.,2000-06-06,STABLE,0.885293185710907
But this increase in overall inflation reflects mainly the rise in oil prices over 1999 and into 2000.,2000-06-06,STABLE,0.8683187961578369

"So, looking forward, the core inflation rate is the more important consideration.",2000-06-06,STABLE,0.8134205341339111
These numbers suggest that inflation pressures remain well contained.,2000-06-06,STABLE,0.850055456161499
"But digging a little deeper, the evidence, in my judgment, supports the conclusion that core inflation has moved modestly higher over the last six to nine months.",2000-06-06,NO-EFFECT,0.5360288619995117
"First, the introduction of a methodological change in measuring the CPI in January 1999 lowered CPI inflation relative to the earlier period.",2000-06-06,STABLE,0.9321913123130798
"As a result, on a methodologically consistent basis, core CPI inflation in the last twelve months has actually been up a couple tenths of a percentage point.",2000-06-06,STABLE,0.5943077802658081
"But, more important, the higher-frequency data provides some evidence of a rising trend in core inflation.",2000-06-06,NO-EFFECT,0.6190009713172913
"For example, at an annual rate, core CPI inflation is 2.4 percent over the last nine months, 2.5 percent over the last six months and 3.2 percent over the last three months.",2000-06-06,STABLE,0.906096875667572
So I conclude that the underlying trend for core CPI inflation has moved up to close to 2-1/2 percent today.,2000-06-06,STABLE,0.6593851447105408
The core PCE and the GDP price indexes also have accelerated over the last six to nine months.,2000-06-06,NO-EFFECT,0.5011031627655029
The higher core inflation could be explained by a pass-through to the core of earlier increases in oil prices.,2000-06-06,STABLE,0.7645184993743896
"However, whether such a pass-through leads to a one-time increase in the price level or to continuing inflation depends on whether or not monetary policy accommodates the higher inflation.",2000-06-06,NO-EFFECT,0.7978419661521912
"Whether such accommodation occurs, in turn, depends on how policy deals with the excess demand that will be felt in the first instance in wage pressures in a very tight labor market.",2000-06-06,NO-EFFECT,0.9772952795028687
"For example, consider the trend in year-over-year growth rates for the three key measures.",2000-06-06,STABLE,0.8781431913375854
"For the employment cost index, the trend is decidedly up; for average hourly earnings, however, the year-over- year growth rate has been flat; and for compensation per hour in the productivity and costs report, the trend is actually down.",2000-06-06,STABLE,0.5247489809989929
"Until the May employment report, the recent monthly data clearly pointed to an acceleration in average hourly earnings--given the 4-1/2 percent rate posted over the first four months of the year after a 3-1/2 percent rate over 1999.",2000-06-06,NO-EFFECT,0.48989251255989075
"There are, in my judgment, some grounds for discounting the productivity and cost measure.",2000-06-06,STABLE,0.6990537643432617
"Even if the evidence for an acceleration in nominal labor compensation were more definitive, the implications for inflation are not altogether straightforward.",2000-06-06,NO-EFFECT,0.7859013676643372
"If the trend in the growth of labor compensation is upward, it could be a response to the uptick in overall inflation last year or to overly tight labor markets or to a catch-up to the higher rate of productivity growth.",2000-06-06,NO-EFFECT,0.5609927177429199
"Just as the slowing in overall inflation in 1997 and 1998 contributed to a moderation in nominal wage demands, the higher overall inflation in 1999 and 2000 would be expected to boost nominal wage demands.",2000-06-06,NO-EFFECT,0.556782066822052
But any rebound in nominal labor compensation could also reflect a catch-up to higher productivity growth.,2000-06-06,NO-EFFECT,0.7158616185188293
"If nominal compensation is just matching the higher productivity growth, this source of acceleration in nominal compensation would not itself be inflationary.",2000-06-06,STABLE,0.8723984956741333
The slow initial response of nominal compensation to higher productivity growth is the source of the temporary disinflationary effect of a productivity shock.,2000-06-06,STABLE,0.7422696352005005
"Therefore, once the catch-up is under way, this disinflationary impetus gradually disappears.",2000-06-06,STABLE,0.558617353439331
"And at this point, the pass-through from higher inflation and the effect of tight labor markets have no offset and will begin to dominate.",2000-06-06,NO-EFFECT,0.9893039464950562
So even the catch-up story plays a role in the upward trend in inflation.,2000-06-06,STABLE,0.8142375946044922
A second reason that nominal compensation is so difficult to factor into an inflation forecast is that compensation practices are changing.,2000-06-06,STABLE,0.8756460547447205
"Stock options are incorporated, based on gains upon exercising the options, in the productivity and cost measure, but not in the ECI.",2000-06-06,STABLE,0.8982922434806824
"So what is the outlook for inflation, and how does it relate to the interplay of new economy forces and traditional supply and demand considerations?",2000-06-06,STABLE,0.9001060128211975
"In my judgment, we took the benefits of both the earlier favorable relative price shocks and the productivity shock, partly in a decline in the unemployment rate below the NAIRU and partly in a decline in inflation.",2000-06-06,STABLE,0.7756410837173462
"This is not a statement about what policymakers planned, but rather about what evolved as we responded to unexpected developments in inflation and growth.",2000-06-06,NO-EFFECT,0.5730288624763489

"At some point, however, when the temporary disinflationary impetus of the favorable supply developments dissipate, not only will there be some rebound in inflation, but unless a transition is made back to sustainable utilization rates, there will be a risk of a continuous upward movement in inflation.",2000-06-06,NO-EFFECT,0.9962741136550903

Conclusion: The Challenge Facing Monetary Policy This analysis suggests that monetary policy does face a challenge--rebalancing aggregate supply and demand to contain the risk of higher inflation.,2000-06-06,NO-EFFECT,0.5969731211662292
The major question in this respect is whether slowing the economy to trend alone will get the job done or whether we need a period of below-trend growth to unwind an imbalance between the levels of aggregate demand and supply.,2000-06-06,NO-EFFECT,0.8837732672691345
"If the task is only slowing the economy to trend--because the NAIRU turns out to be close to 4 percent--the task is not as challenging, and inflation will remain stable near current levels.",2000-06-06,STABLE,0.5046597719192505
"If the NAIRU turns out to be closer to 5 percent, then the task is more demanding, and growth will have to slow to below trend for a while, and inflation is likely to rise somewhat further until the rebalancing is complete.",2000-06-06,NO-EFFECT,0.9964876174926758
"If successful, in either scenario, the payoff from monetary restraint will be both to contain the risk of higher inflation and to extend the life of this remarkable expansion.",2000-06-06,NO-EFFECT,0.7034140825271606
"First, we are now in a high-growth rather than a low-growth economy.",2000-06-06,STABLE,0.8468316793441772
"Even if we have to slow growth to below trend for a period, the resulting growth rate could remain well above the average growth rate over the previous 25 years and still get the job done.",2000-06-06,NO-EFFECT,0.903825044631958
"If oil prices have now at least peaked--and, better yet, if they decline at least modestly over the next year and a half, as suggested by expectations reflected in futures markets--the upward impetus to overall inflation from oil prices will dissipate or even reverse.",2000-06-06,NO-EFFECT,0.961013913154602

"Third, long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored, reflecting considerable confidence that monetary policy will contain any threat of higher inflation.",2000-06-06,STABLE,0.6720767617225647

A key purpose of our review has been to take stock of the lessons learned over this period and identify any further changes in our monetary policy framework that could enhance our ability to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability objectives in the years ahead.9 Our evolving understanding of four key economic developments motivated our review.,2020-08-27,STABLE,0.6570596694946289
"First, assessments of the potential, or longer-run, growth rate of the economy have declined.",2020-08-27,NO-EFFECT,0.7170895934104919

"Estimates of the neutral federal funds rate, which is the rate consistent with the economy operating at full strength and with stable inflation, have fallen substantially, in large part reflecting a fall in the equilibrium real interest rate, or ""r-star.""",2020-08-27,NO-EFFECT,0.9503843188285828
"This rate is not affected by monetary policy but instead is driven by fundamental factors in the economy, including demographics and productivity growthâ€”the same factors that drive potential economic growth.11 The median estimate from FOMC participants of the neutral federal funds rate has fallen by nearly half since early 2012, from 4.25 percent to 2.5 percent (see figure 2).",2020-08-27,STABLE,0.939945638179779
This decline in assessments of the neutral federal funds rate has profound implications for monetary policy.,2020-08-27,NO-EFFECT,0.9031506776809692
"With interest rates generally running closer to their effective lower bound even in good times, the Fed has less scope to support the economy during an economic downturn by simply cutting the federal funds rate.12 The result can be worse economic outcomes in terms of both employment and price stability, with the costs of such outcomes likely falling hardest on those least able to bear them.",2020-08-27,NO-EFFECT,0.9938908815383911

"The Black and Hispanic unemployment rates reached record lows, and the differentials between these rates and the white unemployment rate narrowed to their lowest levels on record.14 As we heard repeatedly in our Fed Listens events, the robust job market was delivering life-changing gains for many individuals, families, and communities, particularly at the lower end of the income spectrum.15 In addition, many who had been left behind for too long were finding jobs, benefiting their families and communities, and increasing the productive capacity of our economy.",2020-08-27,STABLE,0.8205872178077698

"The muted responsiveness of inflation to labor market tightness, which we refer to as the flattening of the Phillips curve, also contributed to low inflation outcomes.17 In addition, longer-term inflation expectations, which we have long seen as an important driver of actual inflation, and global disinflationary pressures may have been holding down inflation more than was generally anticipated.",2020-08-27,NO-EFFECT,0.6893279552459717
Other advanced economies have also struggled to achieve their inflation goals in recent decades.,2020-08-27,STABLE,0.7926878929138184

The significant shifts in estimates of the natural rate of unemployment over the past decade reinforce this point.,2020-08-27,STABLE,0.9024479985237122

Our new statement explicitly acknowledges the challenges posed by the proximity of interest rates to the effective lower bound.,2020-08-27,NO-EFFECT,0.6691448092460632

"With regard to the employment side of our mandate, our revised statement emphasizes that maximum employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal.",2020-08-27,STABLE,0.7870348691940308
"This change reflects our appreciation for the benefits of a strong labor market, particularly for many in low- and moderate-income communities.23 In addition, our revised statement says that our policy decision will be informed by our ""assessments of the shortfalls of employment from its maximum level"" rather than by ""deviations from its maximum level"" as in our previous statement.24 This change may appear subtle, but it reflects our view that a robust job market can be sustained without causing an outbreak of inflation.",2020-08-27,STABLE,0.521263599395752
"In earlier decades when the Phillips curve was steeper, inflation tended to rise noticeably in response to a strengthening labor market.",2020-08-27,STABLE,0.7996739149093628
It was sometimes appropriate for the Fed to tighten monetary policy as employment rose toward its estimated maximum level in order to stave off an unwelcome rise in inflation.,2020-08-27,NO-EFFECT,0.8135408163070679
"The change to ""shortfalls"" clarifies that, going forward, employment can run at or above real-time estimates of its maximum level without causing concern, unless accompanied by signs of unwanted increases in inflation or the emergence of other risks that could impede the attainment of our goals.25 Of course, when employment is below its maximum level, as is clearly the case now, we will actively seek to minimize that shortfall by using our tools to support economic growth and job creation.",2020-08-27,NO-EFFECT,0.9879055023193359
We have also made important changes with regard to the price-stability side of our mandate.,2020-08-27,STABLE,0.5268667340278625
Our longer-run goal continues to be an inflation rate of 2 percent.,2020-08-27,STABLE,0.8013211488723755
Our statement emphasizes that our actions to achieve both sides of our dual mandate will be most effective if longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent.,2020-08-27,STABLE,0.49551090598106384
"However, if inflation runs below 2 percent following economic downturns but never moves above 2 percent even when the economy is strong, then, over time, inflation will average less than 2 percent.",2020-08-27,NO-EFFECT,0.7335349321365356

"A resurgence in interest and research about systematic approaches to monetary policy was sparked by the observation of John Taylor, currently Undersecretary of the Department of the Treasury, that the FOMC's conduct of monetary policy since the late 1980s has been well explained by a simple formula, often called the Taylor rule, that relates the level of the federal funds rate to the observed levels of the inflation and the unemployment rates.",2003-02-12,STABLE,0.9627349376678467

"Thus, they measure the fiscal burden under the assumption that current tax policy is continued, Social Security benefits are not curtailed, and Medicare spending continues to rise with health costs.2 The information provided by generational accounts and other similar methods would definitely be valuable, but their computational methods seem too complicated and rely too much on assumptions about future variables to make them a viable alternative to the current deficit as the main benchmark of fiscal policy.",2004-06-24,STABLE,0.9575284719467163
Overall Deficit Targets A second approach to controlling budget deficits is for the Congress to establish budget targets.,2004-06-24,STABLE,0.9221276640892029
This approach was the centerpiece of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985--commonly known as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings (GRH) Act.,2004-06-24,STABLE,0.9493545889854431
That act aimed to wipe out the deficit in five years.,2004-06-24,STABLE,0.9077487587928772
It did so by establishing annual targets--declining to zero--for the budget deficit.,2004-06-24,STABLE,0.8900611400604248
"The process worked as follows: If projected deficits in the next fiscal year exceeded the targets by $10 billion or more, the legislation mandated that unprotected programs be cut, across-the-board, and by enough to reach the legislated targets.",2004-06-24,STABLE,0.699917197227478
GRH did not allow changes in external circumstances to affect the budget deficit targets.,2004-06-24,STABLE,0.861960768699646
Spending cuts were to be enforced regardless of whether the deficit picture had deteriorated because of worsening economic circumstances or because of congressional action.,2004-06-24,STABLE,0.5300498008728027
"The actual deficit did not meet the target in any of the years GRH was law, in part because, during this period, external events, such as the savings and loan crisis, tended to overtake the policies that the Congress had enacted to try to close the budget gaps.",2004-06-24,STABLE,0.7248839139938354
"For example, the Stability and Growth Pact of the European Monetary Union specifies that the budget deficits of member countries are not to exceed 3 percent of GDP except under some special circumstances.",2004-06-24,STABLE,0.9149976372718811
"But the Stability and Growth Pact has been as ineffective as GRH has, and for the same reasons: Countries have resorted to budgetary gimmicks to meet the criteria, and the sanctions have not been imposed on countries that have not met their targets.",2004-06-24,NO-EFFECT,0.5307515859603882
"Another example of deficit targets comes from the balanced-budget requirements of the states, which can be viewed as deficit targets with the target set at zero.",2004-06-24,STABLE,0.9034708142280579
"Although states have a wide array of budgetary tricks they can and do employ to hit their deficit targets, research evidence suggests that the balanced-budget requirements do limit borrowing and that, as a result, states with more stringent requirements face somewhat lower borrowing costs.",2004-06-24,STABLE,0.8134575486183167
"Furthermore, there seems to be a deeply held consensus that state budgets should be balanced, and this consensus undoubtedly helps legislators make the difficult choices sometimes necessary to balance state budgets.3 Hence, it may seem attractive just to limit overall deficits, but such limits have had only mixed success.",2004-06-24,STABLE,0.5672188997268677
"In a political setting, inflexible deficit limits are likely to lead more to avoidance than to real changes.",2004-06-24,NO-EFFECT,0.6220903396606445
This legislation replaced the system of deficit targets with two types of restraints on legislative actions.,2004-06-24,STABLE,0.8306035399436951
"Second, for revenues and entitlement programs, the BEA established a system called PAYGO (pay as you go) that required all revenue and mandatory spending legislation to be deficit-neutral over a five-year period.",2004-06-24,STABLE,0.8890401124954224
"In other words, the PAYGO restraint didn't require the Congress to climb out of the deficit hole by any particular date, but it did prohibit the Congress from digging the hole any deeper.",2004-06-24,STABLE,0.858283519744873
"Changes in the deficit resulting from changes in economic conditions, health prices, demographics, and other technical or economic factors were allowed to show through to the deficit without sanction.",2004-06-24,STABLE,0.9321995973587036
Budget deficits declined sharply from 1992 to 1997 and then turned to surpluses from 1998 through 2001.,2004-06-24,STABLE,0.9498382806777954
"To a significant extent, of course, the decline in the deficit and the emergence of surpluses were attributable to circumstances external to the budget process, including the stellar performance of the economy; the increase in equity prices, which raised tax revenues to historic highs; and the end of the Cold War, which allowed for a decrease in defense spending.",2004-06-24,STABLE,0.8950359225273132
"But without a broad consensus to reduce the deficit, and without a mechanism to enforce that consensus, the Congress might have responded to these positive developments by increasing spending or cutting taxes.",2004-06-24,NO-EFFECT,0.7137638926506042
"Instead, the federal deficit was allowed to decline.",2004-06-24,STABLE,0.831705629825592
"As a result, national saving increased, providing further impetus to economic growth.",2004-06-24,STABLE,0.6096980571746826
It is difficult to know exactly what the deficit path would have been in the absence of the BEA.,2004-06-24,STABLE,0.7232692837715149
But budget experts generally believe that the BEA did help to reduce deficits.,2004-06-24,STABLE,0.880378782749176
"First, any individual representative knows that bringing home the pork is not likely to have much of an effect on the deficit.",2004-06-24,STABLE,0.8977579474449158
"As already noted, an advantage of the budget rules was that they aimed at constraining the things that the Congress could control directly rather than targeting the overall level of the deficit.",2004-06-24,STABLE,0.8969155550003052
"But unfortunately, even when surpluses emerged, the PAYGO rules continued to require deficit neutrality in mandatory spending and revenue programs and adherence to the discretionary caps.",2004-06-24,STABLE,0.6283981800079346
"In order to be effective, the process must be based on reliable information about current and future baseline budget deficits and about the effects of legislation on the budget.",2004-06-24,STABLE,0.9626487493515015
"Once some success has been achieved with these measures, it may be easier to tackle the more ambitious step of instituting overall deficit limits.",2004-06-24,NO-EFFECT,0.9462553858757019
"The current focus on five years may be a reasonable compromise, or it might be worth considering some more-complicated rules that might limit annual deficits as well as five- or ten-year totals.",2004-06-24,STABLE,0.6663728356361389
"In the past, a reasonable goal might have been to maintain a zero deficit in our on-budget accounts--those accounts that exclude the Social Security and Medicare surplus--and to begin a serious discussion of reforms to Social Security and Medicare to bring them closer into actuarial balance.",2004-06-24,STABLE,0.7938182950019836
"As we progress through the eighth year of the current economic expansion, economic growth has continued at a robust pace with unemployment reaching a 28-year low, while inflation has remained remarkably subdued.",1998-07-09,STABLE,0.7475389242172241
"Although the recent surprises of both low unemployment and well-behaved inflation have been quite favorable, they have been surprises nonetheless and not easily reconcilable with each other based on old relationships and our earlier assessment of the economy's potential.",1998-07-09,NO-EFFECT,0.7625693678855896
These developments have increased the uncertainty about the economic outlook and about the appropriate response of monetary policy in general to new developments.,1998-07-09,NO-EFFECT,0.9590104222297668
I want to take this opportunity to discuss some implications of this increased uncertainty for the conduct of monetary policy.,1998-07-09,STABLE,0.5055875182151794
"Objectives and Strategy for Monetary Policy To evaluate the proper strategy for monetary policy, we must first understand the Federal Reserve's policy objectives and then recognize the parameters within which policy operates in attaining these objectives.",1998-07-09,STABLE,0.9626764059066772
The long-run goal of monetary policy is straightforward.,1998-07-09,STABLE,0.9473967552185059
The Federal Reserve Act mandates that we promote price stability and maximum employment.,1998-07-09,STABLE,0.8841953277587891
"Sometimes this dual objective is misunderstood, with the misconception that these inflation and employment goals cannot be attained simultaneously--that there is a tradeoff in the long run between one and the other.",1998-07-09,STABLE,0.8818520307540894
It is worthwhile repeating what I am sure all of you already understand well: the long-run goals of price stability and maximum employment are not mutually exclusive.,1998-07-09,STABLE,0.919113039970398
"Not so long ago, mainstream macroeconomists thought that employment and growth were by and large independent of inflation in the long run.",1998-07-09,STABLE,0.9300479888916016
But the evidence accumulating in the 1990s seems to suggest that low inflation contributes to real economic performance in ways not fully appreciated before.,1998-07-09,STABLE,0.8765392899513245
"If anything, our approach to price stability, by reducing uncertainty and making long-run savings and investment decisions easier, seems to have enhanced the growth of productivity, real GDP, and employment.",1998-07-09,STABLE,0.5750721096992493
"This indirect benefit, of course, reenforces the price stability goal.",1998-07-09,STABLE,0.832538902759552
"It is the rate of inflation that monetary policy determines in the long run, and this means that price stability in a straightforward way is elevated to the status of the primary long-run goal of monetary policy.",1998-07-09,STABLE,0.9117289185523987
"In the shorter run, inflation may rise and fall depending on where the economy is operating relative to its potential.",1998-07-09,NO-EFFECT,0.8015279769897461

"Likewise, when aggregate demand has fallen short of the economy's potential, inflation has tended to fall.",1998-07-09,STABLE,0.9161591529846191
And this is where the short-run setting of monetary policy comes into play.,1998-07-09,STABLE,0.9186264276504517
"By moving short-term interest rates, monetary policy can affect other financial conditions and end up exerting a substantial influence on aggregate demand.",1998-07-09,STABLE,0.5935354232788086

"As a result, in the shorter run, monetary policy can play an important role in stabilizing the economy from undesired fluctuations in economic activity and inflation.",1998-07-09,STABLE,0.4547427296638489
The strategy for monetary policy geared towards these shorter-run concerns can be briefly described.,1998-07-09,STABLE,0.8842551708221436
It is to restrict monetary conditions when the economy seems on the way to becoming overheated and inflation is threatening and ease monetary conditions when signs of weakness in demand appear on the horizon.,1998-07-09,NO-EFFECT,0.927081286907196

"Of course, other forces besides the state of the economy relative to its potential can influence inflation in the short run.",1998-07-09,STABLE,0.7690740823745728
"Even prior to the anomalous experience of recent years, which I will discuss later in detail, supply shocks, such as a sudden hike in oil prices, have dramatically affected inflation.",1998-07-09,STABLE,0.5949795246124268
"Such forces can also cause short-term fluctuations in the economy that are, at least in part, beyond the control of monetary policy.",1998-07-09,NO-EFFECT,0.5423704385757446

"But monetary policy operates with a long lag, with a policy change exhibiting material effects on the economy (excluding the immediate impact on financial markets) only several quarters after its implementation.",1998-07-09,STABLE,0.7362356185913086

And it may generally take longer still for a policy change to alter the course of inflation.,1998-07-09,NO-EFFECT,0.8850175738334656

Yet considerable uncertainty remains about the confidence with which the new estimates can be relied upon for evaluating inflationary pressures.,1998-07-09,NO-EFFECT,0.9404378533363342

"In assessing inflation faced by American consumers, economists and policymakers generally rely on the change in the consumer price index (CPI) or the change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE).5 Since January 2012, the Committee's price-stability goal has been specified as a longer-run goal of 2 percent in terms of annual PCE inflation.6 Both CPI and PCE inflation metrics are assembled from a collection of underlying elementary price indexes for narrow subsets of goods and services.7 The price changes each month for the goods and services in these subsets are combined into measures of overall inflation by calculating a weighted average of all these subindexes, where the weights are based on average aggregate consumer expenditures in each category.",2022-04-05,STABLE,0.9047703146934509

The change in such a cost-of-living index would represent the average inflation experienced by U.S. households.,2022-04-05,STABLE,0.932806134223938
"Instead, because the CPI and PCE indexes weight every dollar of expenditure equally, these indexes implicitly weight each household's cost of living proportionally to their total expenditure.8 Since lower-income households represent a relatively smaller share of overall expenditure, the inflation associated with their consumption baskets is underrepresented in the official consumer price indexes.",2022-04-05,STABLE,0.8924369215965271
"It would be useful to have data about consumer inflation broken out by demographic groups, similar to labor market and personal-income data, in order to assess the differential effect of inflation across different groups of households.9 U.S. statistical agencies do not collect the information needed to accurately assess inflation at a household level, and it would require a large change in the way these agencies go about their work to do so.",2022-04-05,STABLE,0.9412863850593567
"Nonetheless, recent research has begun to assess variation in the ways different households experience inflation.",2022-04-05,STABLE,0.9181751608848572
Households at different income levels could experience differential inflation effects for several reasons: Consumption shares could differ systematically for low- and high-income households; the goods and services within each consumption category could differ; the ability to substitute for lower-priced alternatives of the same item could differ; and prices paid for the same good could differ systematically due to differences in access.,2022-04-05,NO-EFFECT,0.7267210483551025
"First, low- and moderate-income households could experience inflation that diverges from the average because their consumption baskets differ systematically from the average.",2022-04-05,NO-EFFECT,0.7750256657600403
10 Lower-income households spend 77 percent of their income on necessitiesâ€”more than double the 31 percent of income spent by higher-income households on these categories.11 Several studies have found that the consumption baskets of lower-income households have experienced higher-than-average inflation rates over time.,2022-04-05,STABLE,0.8148903846740723

"A 2021 working paper by BLS staff based on data from 2003 to 2018 found that a price index reflecting the consumption basket for households in the lowest-income quartile grew faster than the overall CPI, while a price index reflecting the consumption basket for households in the highest-income quartile grew more slowly than the overall CPI.12 A 2015 BLS study found a similar result using data from 1982 to 2014.13 Of course, the recent sharp increases in inflation may have affected the consumption bundles of lower-income households relative to the average differently than in previous cycles.",2022-04-05,STABLE,0.8572277426719666

"Using transaction-level data, researchers found that almost two-thirds of the variation in inflation across households comes from differences in prices paid for identical goods, with only about one-third coming from differences in the mix of goods within broad categories.14 As a result of these differences, households with lower incomes, more household members, or older household heads experienced higher inflation on average.",2022-04-05,STABLE,0.9300224184989929

"According to one popular hypothesis, this tendency reflects cyclical variations in the intensity with which labor is utilized.6 Because adjusting the size of a company's labor force may involve significant fixed costs (including training costs as well as costs of hiring and firing), employers are generally reluctant to add or subtract workers at the first sign of a change in the demand for their products.",2005-01-19,STABLE,0.7399400472640991

"November 19, 2021 Perspectives on Global Monetary Policy Coordination, Cooperation, and Correlation Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the ""Macroeconomic Policy and Global Economic Recovery"" 2021 Asia Economic Policy Conference, sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Center for Pacific Basin Studies, San Francisco, California (via webcast) Share Watch Live In my remarks today, I would like to offer some perspectives on global monetary policy correlation and what it canâ€”and cannotâ€”reveal about the prevalence and value of global monetary policy coordination or, in the limit, binding global monetary cooperation.1 In both the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the Global Pandemic Collapse (GPC), major central banks around the world responded by cutting policy rates to, and then keeping them at, their effective lower bounds (ELBs); by increasing their balance sheets through ambitious and expansive large-scale asset purchase and lending programs; and by offering forward guidanceâ€”both Delphic and Odysseanâ€”on the stance of their future monetary policies.2 As these examples make clear, we certainly do observe that national monetary policies are often correlated, and such examples are not confined to recent experience.",2021-11-19,STABLE,0.9850969910621643
"Indeed, the international monetary economics literature abounds with historical and empirical studies of correlated global monetary policy cycles, not to mention the evident secular downtrend in global monetary policy rates observed in recent decades.",2021-11-19,STABLE,0.9073721170425415
"To begin with the theory, it has long been appreciated that in the sorts of economic models used by central banks around the world, the calibrated gains to international monetary policy cooperation are found to be rather modest relative to a status quo ante in which each country runs a sensible policy, taking as given the sensible policies of the other countries.",2021-11-19,STABLE,0.969144344329834
"Today I will make a somewhat different, and less often discussed, case questioning formal global monetary policy cooperationâ€”that, in practice, adopting it could plausibly erode central bank credibility and public support for central bank instrument independence.",2021-11-19,NO-EFFECT,0.6523327827453613
"International monetary policy coordination, which I think of as including the sharing of information and analysis among central banks regarding the evolution of their individual economies as well as the considerations that govern the setting of their policy instrumentsâ€”in other words, information about their policy reaction functions can, and in my observation certainly does, enhance the design and effectiveness of monetary policy execution for each country.",2021-11-19,STABLE,0.9693069458007812
"But while international monetary policy coordination may enhance the efficiency of monetary policy execution, I am skeptical that in practice there are additional material, reliable, and robust gains that would flow from a formal regime of binding monetary policy cooperation, at least among major G-7 economies with flexible exchange rates, open capital accounts, and central bank mandates that include price stability.",2021-11-19,NO-EFFECT,0.5871825218200684
"In such a regime, national monetary policies in each country would be constrained to be set in such a way so as to jointly maximize some metric for global price stability and perhaps also other objectives.",2021-11-19,NO-EFFECT,0.576015830039978
The reason is that there can be global externalities to monetary policy that create such theoretical gains to cooperation.,2021-11-19,STABLE,0.8436731100082397
"However, as Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2002), among others, have shown in the context of central banks with domestic price-stability mandates, to achieve the theoretical gains to international monetary policy cooperation, policy in each country must be set with reference to an index of inflation in all countries party to the cooperative agreement.",2021-11-19,STABLE,0.9209761619567871
"This is a policy that no central bank would choose were it not bound to the agreement to achieve domestic price stability while taking other central banks' policies as given, which, of course, raises the question of how such an agreement might be enforced.",2021-11-19,STABLE,0.7385257482528687
"But in practice, no sovereign central bank outsources its policy to an Excel spreadsheet, and, moreover, best-practice policy rules incorporate inputsâ€”such as the neutral rate of interest or expected inflationâ€”that are unobserved and time varying and thus difficult to monitor.",2021-11-19,STABLE,0.853029727935791

"Simply stated and in the context of a price-stability mandate for each central bank, the problemâ€”as I see itâ€”is the threat to the credibility of the central bank, the challenges to central bank communication, and the resulting potential loss of support for its policy actions from the public when the policy choices that would be required by binding monetary policy cooperation react not only to home inflation deviations from target, but also to deviations of foreign inflation from target.",2021-11-19,NO-EFFECT,0.9847132563591003
"In theoretical models, the commitment to the inflation target is just assumed to be perfect and credible, but in practice, credibility appears to be a function of central bank communication and of the policies actually implemented pushing inflation towardâ€”and, in the absence of shocks, keeping inflation atâ€”target.",2021-11-19,STABLE,0.7685608267784119

"The authors also find compelling evidence that the magnitude of the cross-border spillovers attributed to U.S. monetary policy shifts depends on a country's macroeconomic vulnerabilityâ€”as measured by inflation, current account deficit, international reserves, government debt, external debt, and private-sector credit growth, with more vulnerable EM countries experiencing larger spillovers from U.S. monetary policy.",2021-11-19,STABLE,0.6115513443946838

"This decline has critical implications for monetary policy because it leaves central banks with less conventional policy space to offset adverse shocks to aggregate demand.5 As discussed in Clarida (2020), the Fed's review, from the outset, built on three pillars: a series of Fed Listens events, a flagship research conference, and a series of rigorous briefings for the Committee commencing in July 2019 and running through January 2020.6 While our plans to conclude the review earlier in 2020 were, like so many things, delayed by the arrival of the pandemic, in August 2020, the Federal Reserve did announce, with unanimous support, an evolution of its monetary policy strategy to flexible average inflation targeting.7 Similar to the Federal Reserve, the ECB launched a review of its monetary policy strategy in January 2020.8 Since the time of its previous strategy review in 2003, like the Fed, the ECB observed profound structural changes in the global and euro-area economies that have driven down neutral interest rates and increased the incidence and duration of episodes in which nominal policy interest rates are close to the ELB.",2021-11-19,NO-EFFECT,0.9642840623855591

"Empirical Evidence on Asset Prices and Spending At the aggregate level, a wealth effect on consumption has been a mainstay of large-scale econometric models for at least thirty years.",2001-11-30,STABLE,0.9789263606071472
"Personal saving--which is measured in the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts as the difference between disposable income and outlays--dropped from 6-1/2 percent of disposable income at the end of 1994 to roughly 1 percent in early 2000, when equity prices peaked.",2001-11-30,STABLE,0.9088011384010315
The magnitude of this decline is consistent with the runup in equity prices and the marginal propensity to consume out of equity wealth that appears in the Fed’s model.,2001-11-30,NO-EFFECT,0.6702222228050232
"For example, one study that analyzed the response of individual households to changes in stock market wealth found that, over the 1983-to-1999 period, the spending of U.S. households that own stocks responded to movements in the stock market, whereas the spending of non-holders of stocks has no apparent link to stock prices.1 A second study has estimated that, in the second half of the 1990s, households in the top of the income and education distributions in the United States showed the largest consumption increases, consistent with the fact that these households owned the most stocks and experienced the largest gains in wealth.2 Unfortunately, microeconomic evidence on the link between housing wealth and consumption is much more limited.",2001-11-30,STABLE,0.8925663232803345
But the substantial gains in housing wealth that have been experienced in recent years and the disparate movement of house and equity prices make this an issue of both policy and academic interest.,2001-11-30,NO-EFFECT,0.9324936270713806

"When we turn to business spending, the evidence in support of a direct causal link from equity prices to business investment is weaker.",2001-11-30,NO-EFFECT,0.7019492983818054
"Indeed, neither Tobin’s q nor other approaches to formalizing the effect of equity prices on business investment have fared well in most empirical tests.",2001-11-30,STABLE,0.9416059255599976
Other influences on business investment aside from asset-price fluctuations--such as the acceleration in business output and the cash flow of firms--often have proven more robust and more important explanators of capital spending than stock prices.,2001-11-30,STABLE,0.8508372902870178
"However, some careful research--again partly conducted by Federal Reserve economists--suggests that a cost-of-capital effect on investment comes through clearly in empirical models based either on natural experiments with exogenous shocks to the cost of capital or on other econometric techniques that identify the exogenous parts of observed changes in user cost.3 Other recent work suggests that investment is also affected by at least those movements in stock prices that reflect the discounted value of expected profits.4 This important literature is too complex for me to review in detail today.",2001-11-30,STABLE,0.9504026174545288
"Let me say simply that, despite the empirical puzzles, I believe that the cost-of-capital effect is likely to be at work when stock prices rise or fall significantly.",2001-11-30,NO-EFFECT,0.9100114107131958

A further complication in evaluating these two scenarios is that the aggregate response of household spending and investment will generally feed back to asset markets and generate further changes in prices and discount rates.,2001-11-30,NO-EFFECT,0.9841325283050537
But the basic point is that wealth changes reflecting future profits (or productivity) and wealth changes reflecting interest rates could have very different effects on consumption.,2001-11-30,STABLE,0.8780171871185303
I believe that further research on both the theoretical and empirical aspects of this issue could contribute significantly to our understanding of the relationship between asset prices and macroeconomic outcomes.,2001-11-30,STABLE,0.8911200165748596

"Since the peak, the Wilshire 5000 has dropped by about one-third, corresponding to a loss in wealth of roughly $6 trillion.5 Not only have the recent movements in U.S. stock prices been extremely large, they have arguably affected more households than did past movements in the stock market because of the broadening ownership of corporate equities in the United States.",2001-11-30,NO-EFFECT,0.9631162881851196

"Faster productivity growth was among the factors that boosted equity valuations; in turn, larger expected productivity advances and a lower cost of equity capital provided a further stimulus to investment.",2001-11-30,STABLE,0.5752686858177185
The pickup in investment combined with the wealth effect on consumption to boost aggregate demand.,2001-11-30,STABLE,0.8221538066864014

"The title of this year's conference was ""New Challenges for Monetary Policy.""",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9036839604377747
The papers described both the emerging consensus about the objectives and strategies underlying the conduct of monetary policy and highlighted a number of new challenges.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8824948072433472
"In the first section of today's lecture I will outline the framework and identify the objectives of monetary policy, describe the operational procedures used to conduct monetary policy, and discuss the strategy for carrying out monetary policy to achieve those objectives.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.951691746711731
"A number of participates at the conference suggested that there was an emerging consensus about the appropriate strategy--specifically, flexible inflation targeting.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8043028712272644
Then I will turn to the new challenges for monetary policy identified at the conference.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8043505549430847
"First, does a low-inflation environment--and specifically the possibility that nominal interest rates might decline to zero in such an environment--constrain the effectiveness of monetary policy, and if so, how can monetary policy adjust to maintain its effectiveness?",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.504233717918396
"Second, how should monetary policy respond to movements in asset prices in general and, specifically, to the possibility of asset-market bubbles?",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8683624863624573
"Third, what is the best option for exchange rate and monetary policy regimes for small open emerging market countries, in light of increased globalization and especially larger and more volatile international capital flows?",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.6452573537826538
The basic theme of the conference was that flexible inflation targeting provides a constructive response to each of these challenges.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8858784437179565
"Careful design and implementation of the framework, including the choice of an inflation target, would, for example, reduce the prospect that monetary policy might lose its ability to stimulate the economy further because nominal short-term interest rates had fallen to zero.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.5680227875709534
"Similarly, following such a disciplined monetary policy would mitigate, though not entirely eliminate, the effect of asset bubbles.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8262569904327393
"Finally, countries that move to a flexible exchange rate regime--as many have done recently--need to put in place a disciplined monetary framework such as is offered by this approach.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.7374144196510315
"The Monetary Policy Framework Let me start this discussion by identifying what the objectives of monetary policy are, and should be, and then discuss what strategies are useful in achieving the objectives.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9608799815177917
"Objectives of Monetary Policy One of the themes of the conference was that there is an emerging consensus about the objectives of monetary policy, one that has been reflected in the conduct of monetary policy in many countries for some time and now is finding its way into the rhetoric of policymakers.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9108044505119324
I would describe the consensus as an acceptance of a dual mandate for monetary policy.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9033832550048828
"Monetary policy seeks first to achieve and maintain price stability over the longer run and, second, to retain the flexibility to damp cyclical fluctuations in the economy around full employment.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.6130702495574951
"At the conference, the consensus was described as ""flexible inflation targeting.""",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9134840369224548
"Most central banks want to emphasize, with good reason, their price stability objective.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.849636971950531
"First, monetary policy, in the long run, principally affects nominal variables such as nominal income, the price level, and the rate of inflation, but has lesser effects on real variables--such as the level of employment or the level or growth rate of output.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9455388784408569
I expect all central bankers would agree that an environment of price stability offers the best contribution that monetary policy can make to the level and growth of output because it eliminates distortions to resource allocation and disincentives to saving and investment associated with high and variable inflation rates.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.617828369140625
It follows that a more accommodative monetary policy cannot foster a higher average rate of real growth.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.6779422760009766
"The second strongly held view is that because monetary policy is the principal determinant of the inflation rate in the long run, central banks have a responsibility to set an appropriate target for long-run inflation and achieve it.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9142757654190063
"And that target should be price stability or, at the least, a low rate of inflation.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.874653160572052
"While monetary policy cannot raise the level or rate of growth of output over the long run through any means other than maintaining price stability, it is widely, though not universally, accepted that monetary policy can affect the level and growth rate of output in the short run and, perhaps, therefore contribute to smoothing out fluctuations in the economy around full employment.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.4765196442604065
This is sometimes referred to as the short-run stabilization objective for monetary policy.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9146715998649597
A central issue for monetary policy is how to balance the dual objectives of price stability and output stabilization and how explicit to be about the commitment to these dual objectives.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8376641869544983
"Both theoretical and, especially, empirical macroeconomics have established the existence of an inescapable trade-off affecting the conduct of monetary policy.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9681955575942993
The trade-off is between the variability of inflation around its target (zero or some low rate) and the variability of output around its target (the full-employment level of output or potential output).,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9026004672050476
"Autonomous increases or decreases in aggregate spending push output and inflation in the same direction relative to their targets and, therefore, do not bring this trade-off into play.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9205314517021179
But supply shocks--such as increases or decreases in oil or food prices--drive output and inflation in opposite directions relative to their respective targets.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.6875627636909485
"The more quickly monetary policy reacts to restore inflation to its target following a supply shock, the greater will be the variability in output relative to its target.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.9286636710166931
The reason for this trade-off is that monetary policy affects inflation primarily through its initial effect on the amount of slack in the economy.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9143398404121399
"Tightening monetary policy slows spending growth, opens up some slack temporarily in labor and product markets, and allows the slack to reduce inflation.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.6184479594230652
"Once inflation has returned to its target, policy can guide the economy back to full employment.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.7690469026565552
"It probably takes a certain amount of slack over time to reduce inflation by a given amount, but reducing inflation rapidly means opening up an especially large output gap for a short period--hence the trade-off between inflation and output stability.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.687103807926178
"Several countries have moved to inflation-targeting regimes over the last decade or so, setting a numerical target for inflation.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9326361417770386
"This was generally part of a process of shifting responsibility for monetary policy from finance ministries to independent central banks and often followed a period of poor macroeconomic performance, especially high and variable inflation.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.5070691704750061
The newly independent central banks often identified inflation as the singular objective of monetary policy to gain credibility and facilitate the transition to price stability.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8395047187805176
"With price stability now largely accomplished, some of these central banks are becoming more flexible in their approaches to monetary policy by recognizing a role for short-run stabilization.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.7942999601364136
"In the United States, Congress has set the objectives for monetary policy in the Federal Reserve Act, as amended in 1977.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9231418967247009
"The objectives are maximum employment and stable prices, which are mutually consistent and achievable if maximum employment is interpreted as the maximum employment sustainable without rising or falling inflation.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8754881620407104
"Inflation-targeting countries typically have goals of about 2 percent to 2 ½ percent for inflation and sometimes establish a range for inflation, for example, 1 percent to 3 percent.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9063960909843445
"It was widely agreed at Jackson Hole that the United States has, without an explicit target, achieved the same success in reducing inflation as countries with explicit numerical targets.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9539085626602173
"I will not be considering the pros and cons of an explicit numerical target for inflation today, although I recognize this is an important question and one that warrants further discussion.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8916574716567993
"Virtually all central banks carry out monetary policy operations by influencing--in effect setting--some short-term nominal interest rate, typically the rate on overnight inter-bank loans.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9162837266921997
"By adjusting this single rate, the Federal Reserve affects the broader array of interest rates and asset prices in the economy and, in turn, affects aggregate demand, the level of real economic activity, and inflation.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.901343584060669
There are two ways of describing the strategy for monetary policy.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9453546404838562
"One focuses on ""instrument rules,"" which describe how the policy instrument--in this case a short-term interest rate--should be moved in response to economic developments.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9575191736221313
The Taylor Rule describes how the federal funds rate should be adjusted in response to movements in output relative to its long-run sustainable level and to movements in inflation relative to its target.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9405786395072937
The Taylor Rule thus explicitly embodies the dual objectives of monetary policy and is a form of flexible inflation targeting.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9543437361717224
"In practice, no one expects monetary policy to be conducted according to a rigid rule.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8989594578742981
"Such rules can, however, be useful in informing policy decisions and helping policymakers calibrate their responses to changes in utilization and inflation rates.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8696280717849731
A second strategy is to move the instrument in response to the inflation forecast.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.7792026996612549
"In this approach, the policymakers start with a forecast of inflation over some interval, typically about two years.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9472950100898743
Policy is then set over this interval to achieve the price stability target by the end of the period.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8047277927398682
"The interval chosen to reach the inflation target takes into account the fact that the more rapid the return to the target, the greater the variability in output relative to its target.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8573947548866272
The time interval is thus a vehicle for allowing policymakers to damp movements in output around full employment and at the same time ensure that the inflation objective is eventually achieved.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.5741778612136841
Inflation forecast targeting has the advantage of being explicitly forward-looking.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8883270025253296
"The Taylor Rule takes explicit account of only very recent observations on inflation and output, but these are, to be sure, important determinants of future inflation.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9659920334815979
An inflation forecast approach allows policymakers to consider a wider range of current and past information in projecting future outcomes.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9523427486419678
"D. Setting the Inflation Target Setting the inflation target to be consistent with price stability sounds straightforward, but an important theme at this summer's conference was the variety of options and implications of this choice.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8828405737876892
"The obvious choice would be a target of zero for inflation, taking into account biases in published price measures.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8855372667312622
But an intriguing alternative is to set a target for the price level.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.7442123293876648

"This can produce a more predictable price level in the long run, but many analysts are concerned about how the economy would respond to a period of deflation.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.9594234824180603
Yet another alternative is to target a low positive inflation rate--specifically an inflation rate somewhat above a level that reflected estimates of the bias in published measures.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.790080726146698
"One of the issues I will discuss shortly is whether targeting a low, positive rate of ""true"" inflation (what I call price stability plus cushion) might result in better cyclical performance of the economy than a zero inflation target.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.6897165179252625
Still another choice is an average inflation target.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9402061700820923
"If the target was 2 percent and inflation temporarily moved to 3 percent, an average inflation target policy would encourage a decline in the inflation rate to below 2 percent for a while, moving the average back to 2 percent.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.921181857585907
"This allows for a predictable (albeit rising) long-run price level, while avoiding the deflationary episodes that would occasionally be called for under a constant price level target.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.6862412095069885
Monetary Policy in a Low-Inflation Environment I turn now to the challenges associated with the conduct of monetary policy in a low-inflation environment.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.915885865688324
"The issue here is whether, at very low inflation rates, the cyclical performance of the economy would deteriorate.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.5981143116950989

"Among the possible responses is adjusting the definition of the inflation target, so I will be building on the preceding discussion.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9243979454040527
"A. Keynes' Liquidity Trap and the Zero Nominal Bound Problem John Maynard Keynes, in his classic work, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, warned that monetary policy might become ineffective once interest rates fell to some low level at which wealth owners might become indifferent as to whether they held money or bonds.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8662987947463989
"In this case, it would be impossible for monetary policy to affect interest rates by affecting the composition of portfolios, specifically the amount of money held relative to bonds.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9218612313270569
"But with short-term rates now at zero in Japan and low inflation almost everywhere in the industrialized world, the problem is taken more seriously by central banks--to the point that it was one of the topics at Jackson Hole.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.722889244556427
"The liquidity trap, as Keynes used the term, is better thought of as a term-structure trap or, more generally, a limit on how low long-term and private interest rates can go once the interest rate on short-term government debt is pushed to zero.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8291847705841064
"When short-term government rates reached zero, Keynes believed that there would still be positive interest rates on both longer-term government securities and private debt and that monetary policy then would be unable to push those rates any lower.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.6307892799377441
The liquidity trap is sometimes referred to as the problem of the zero bound on nominal interest rates.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8907109498977661
"Nominal interest rates cannot be negative, because, in this case, every one would want to hold cash.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8390822410583496

"If inflation were 2 percent, for example, monetary policy, by driving the nominal interest rate to zero, could push real interest rates to minus 2 percent.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.5658100247383118
"If prices were stable, on the other hand, the limit on the real interest rate would be zero, and this limit might constrain the ability of monetary policy to offset downward shocks to the economy.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.9644092321395874
"B. Nominal Rigidities Another long-standing explanation for why low inflation might result in a deterioration in macroeconomic performance is the possible existence of nominal wage rigidities--specifically, a reluctance to reduce nominal wages.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.5044649839401245
"When inflation is very low, achieving this variation in relative real wages depends on some wages falling.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8252611756324768
"If nominal wage cuts are rare, efficiency in the allocation of resources may decline, and as a result, output might be lower at price stability than if there were some low rate of inflation.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.9837032556533813
"And in the absence of declines in nominal wages for some workers, average real wages will be higher, and hence average employment lower, at price stability.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.5405530333518982

"In addition, it is not clear how much rigidity would remain if we achieved and sustained steady low inflation.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.9789232611656189
"C. Japan's Current Experience As I noted earlier, Japan presents a laboratory for observing an economy with low inflation.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.954052746295929
Japan enjoyed effective price stability through most of the 1980s.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.937260627746582
"In continuing its efforts to move the economy toward recovery, the Bank of Japan last February lowered short-term interest rates to almost zero.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.885518491268158
"Although Japan registered surprisingly robust growth in the first half, most observers see private-sector demand as still quite weak despite the low short-term rates.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.5530996918678284
"How could monetary policymakers have avoided this predicament, and once they were in it were there unconventional forms of monetary policy that would have permitted them to provide additional stimulus to demand?",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.7117376327514648
"D. How to Avoid the Problem At the Jackson Hole conference, Mervyn King and Lars Svensson argued that a flexible inflation-targeting regime would help policymakers avoid this problem in the first place.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9629955291748047
"While King in particular had some doubts about the zero nominal interest rate bound and especially about the existence of nominal rigidities, both he and Svensson noted that opting for a positive inflation rate as a target was a prudent way of avoiding testing either of these hypotheses.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.7135396003723145
"Indeed, they both noted that inflation-targeting central banks virtually always opt for inflation targets greater than zero and greater than estimates of the inflation bias in published measures of inflation.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9509130716323853
Recent research suggests that even a cushion of 1 percentage point (above an amount equal to the expected bias in inflation measures) can go a long way toward avoiding the problem of deteriorating cyclical performance at low inflation rates.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.5012047290802002
The second key to avoiding this problem is to have a symmetrical inflation target.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9524640440940857
This means one that evokes an aggressive response to both falling below and to rising above the inflation target.,1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.5628673434257507
"Monetary policymakers can always choke-off inflation by raising real interest rates, because there is no limit to how high real interest rates can be pushed.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.7317288517951965
"There is a limit, however, to how low real interest rates can decline, given the zero nominal interest rate bound.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.6481430530548096
"Therefore, to the degree that any asymmetry is called for, it might be to move more quickly and more decisively with respect to downward than to upward disturbances to aggregate demand, at least when beginning from already low nominal interest rates.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.994860827922821
A third possibility is that the zero nominal bound problem can be reduced or eliminated either by a credible price level target or by an average inflation target.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8879199624061584
"If the price level falls in response to downside shocks, a price level target will imply that monetary policy will move more aggressively to stimulate the economy, once demand recovers and monetary policy has regained its effectiveness, than would have been the case with a traditional inflation target.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.9534225463867188
This would ensure that a period of deflation will be followed by a corresponding period of inflation.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9081159830093384
"Assuming bondholders take into account this more aggressive stimulus, bondholders will project that zero nominal short-term interest rates will be maintained longer than would otherwise be the case, justifying lower long-term interest rates today.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.9329033493995667
A similar result could be achieved by an average inflation target.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9338542222976685
"If inflation was zero for a while, bondholders would project a period of inflation above the long-run inflation target--for example, 3 percent or 4 percent instead of 2 percent--until the average inflation rate returned to 2 percent.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.915790319442749
This would lead to expectations that short-term interest rates would remain low for a longer period and contribute to a decline in real long-term rates today.,1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.9836840629577637
"If a target for price level, positive inflation rate, or average inflation rate had not been implemented and made credible before a central bank was confronted by zero nominal interest rates, the central bank could, of course, introduce them at that time.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.5848563313484192
"Moreover, with prices falling and the economy in recession, one could imagine a good deal of skepticism about the ability of the central bank to meet its objective.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.9276586771011353
Paul Krugman has urged the Bank of Japan to move to a positive inflation target as a way of lowering real interest rates and stimulating the economy.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8830561637878418
"The Bank of Japan has resisted, arguing that, given its inability to increase aggregate demand, there would be little credibility in setting a positive inflation target.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.5365414023399353
"Even if the Bank of Japan today cannot expect to stimulate demand and thereby raise inflation, they will almost surely have this opportunity well before today's long-term bonds mature.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.5933976769447327
They could therefore commit today to maintaining a positive inflation rate when it becomes possible and thereby raise inflation expectations today and lower real interest rates.,1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.9611838459968567
"However, such a distant increase in inflation might not have much impact on the real cost of borrowing today, so I continue to be skeptical that initiating an inflation targeting approach, once confronted by the zero nominal bound, offers a reliable way out of the zero nominal bound problem.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.9769111275672913
A second approach would be to undertake unconventional monetary policy operations.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.5460346341133118
"Conventional monetary policy is implemented, as I described, by employing open market operations concentrated in repurchase agreements or in the short end of the government debt market.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8833199739456177
"An alternative approach, sometimes referred to as a monetization strategy, focuses on increasing the money supply rather than on the level of short-term interest rates.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8748072385787964
"At Jackson Hole, Allan Meltzer offered a clear framework for the way such a policy direction might allow additional stimulus after conventional operations had lowered nominal short-term interest rates to zero.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8914120197296143
"In the typical model, money and bonds become perfect substitutes at some low interest rate, perhaps zero, and we have a liquidity trap where monetary policy loses its power to add further stimulus by lowering interest rates on bonds.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.5394364595413208
Meltzer suggested this result reflects more the limits of the typical model than the limits on monetary policy.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9618943929672241
"In an activist approach, monetary policy would increase the sum of the money supply and short-term government debt--the assets that have become perfect substitutes--by widening the scope of open market operations to include purchases of long-term government debt and perhaps private debt and foreign exchange.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.5035887956619263
"Such operations might lower interest rates on long-term and private securities and/or result in a depreciation of the currency, in all cases stimulating aggregate demand.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.7088884115219116
This will be the outcome of deflation as long as the central bank does not let the nominal money supply decline as the price level falls.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.7870102524757385
"The net result will be lower interest rates on long-term and private securities and higher values of equities that, in turn, will stimulate spending, over and above the stimulus that results from the wealth effect associated with increased real money balances.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.642675518989563
Important questions relate to both the theoretical structure of asset demands and empirical evidence about portfolio behavior and asset markets.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9595463871955872
The issue of whether relative supply of short and long-term bonds affects the term structure of interest rates is crucial.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.6995121240615845
"The most widely accepted theory of the term structure, called the pure expectations model, holds that long-term interest rates are a weighted average of current and expected future short-term rates.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.974704921245575
"I have never given much weight to the role of relative supply effects in affecting the term structure or exchange rates, given the failure of empirical studies to find much evidence of such effects.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.960741400718689
"Of course, at the extreme, the Bank of Japan could set the price and hence interest rate on long-term bonds if it was prepared to take all these assets onto its balance sheet.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.7686750292778015
Another reason for skepticism is that the domestic channel through which monetary policy works in Japan operates very importantly through the banking system.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8751811981201172
"In this case, attention shifts to the effect of monetization on exchange rates and to the recommendation that the Bank of Japan raise the money supply by purchasing foreign currency, an operation sometimes referred to as unsterilized exchange rate intervention.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8644589781761169
There is a case in which unsterilized intervention has a more powerful effect on exchange rates than sterilized intervention (where the central bank absorbs any reverses introduced as part of exchange rate intervention).,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8519599437713623
"But this incremental effect arises because unsterilized intervention is expected to lower the country's interest rates and the lower interest rates would, in turn, put downward pressure on the country's exchange rate.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.9382432699203491
"If the interest rate channel does not operate because of a liquidity trap, this could raise questions about the effect of unsterilized foreign exchange intervention.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.9522548317909241
This could affect a range of interest rates and the exchange rate.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.5141482353210449
"Therefore, implementing a monetization strategy in this way would appear to shift the decision about the timing and magnitude of monetary policy from the newly independent central bank back to the Ministry of Finance.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.5317985415458679
"Nevertheless, if the Japanese economy fails to respond to the policies now in place, one could argue for some experimentation in this direction, given the absence of other options for monetary policy.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.9500307440757751
"Finally, in cases of a nominal interest rate bound, fiscal policy could and should carry more of the stabilization burden, as has been the case in Japan recently.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.8355581164360046
Asset Market Bubbles and Monetary Policy Let me move to the challenge of how monetary policy should respond to suspicions of asset market bubbles.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9139633774757385
An asset market bubble refers to an extended increase in the price of assets not justified by the fundamentals.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.6613226532936096
"I do find it plausible that market prices might sometimes, and for some period, depart from values that are justified by fundamental forces.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.9035211205482483
"The fundamental value of a stock is the present value of the expected earnings stream of the firm in question, derived by applying a discount factor that accounts for both the interest rate on safe assets and a risk factor appropriate to the uncertainties about the expected future earnings stream.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9222351908683777
The fundamentals underpinning the price of equities are therefore the expected increase in earnings and the discount rate that transforms expected earnings into a price for the asset.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8798951506614685
"Equity prices could rise above their fundamental value if investors hold unrealistic expectations about earnings growth, if they assume that the earnings stream is more stable than it will turn out to be, or if they otherwise believe there is less risk associated with holding the equities than turns out to be the case.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.9825212359428406
A similar process underlies the price of real property.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9216943979263306
"Monetary policy, as I emphasized earlier, focuses on price stability and damping fluctuations around full employment.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8226422667503357
"Should it also focus on encouraging asset prices to return toward perceived fundamental value, if asset prices appear to depart significantly from policymakers' perception of that fundamental value?",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.9094036817550659
"During the 1980s, the Japanese economy registered very strong growth, low inflation, and soaring equity and property prices.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9341210722923279
"In 1989, following a tightening of monetary policy, there was a sharp collapse in asset prices.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.7510043978691101
Equity prices fell by 60 percent and urban land values by more than 75 percent.,1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.5692611336708069
"In addition to direct effects via the decline in wealth on consumer spending, the collapse of asset prices had a devastating effect on the banking system.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.5638789534568787
Japanese banks therefore suffered a double blow in the collapse of equity and property prices.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.5043511390686035
Many have viewed the surge in equity prices in the United States over the past four years as evidence of a bubble.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.7481352686882019
It is true that the rise in equity prices--averaging 25 percent to 30 percent a year over the last four years--is unprecedented and that current values challenge previous valuation standards.,1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.7754914164543152
But one could argue that structural changes in the economy have raised the sustainable level and growth of earnings and lowered the volatility of earnings or otherwise reduced the perceived risk in equities.,1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.586085855960846
"Such structural changes could, in principle, justify at least a substantial portion of the rise in equity prices.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.7940071821212769
But the question at issue here is whether policymakers should substitute their judgment about fundamental value for the market's assessment and use monetary policy to encourage a convergence back to their own estimate of fundamental value.,1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.5152233242988586
They used a methodology that has proved valuable in studying a number of other questions related to the strategy of monetary policy.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9659883379936218
They observe the resulting variability of inflation and output relative to their respective targets.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.7789137363433838

"Bernanke and Gertler examine whether an attempt by policymakers to return equity prices toward their estimate of fundamental value improves macroeconomic performance, judged in terms of inflation variability and output variability.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.938224732875824
"They find that policymakers cannot improve the outcomes by responding directly to suspected deviations of equity prices from fundamentals, but that a policy focused on achieving price stability and damping fluctuations around full employment will mitigate the adverse consequences of equity market bubbles.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.5241119861602783
"That is, a monetary policy focused on price stability and output stabilization will respond to the effects of higher equity prices on aggregate demand, real economic activity, and inflation.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.6640174984931946
"This will generally dampen movements in equity prices, while contributing to meeting the broader macroeconomic objectives of monetary policy.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.5002623200416565
"However, given the difficulty in distinguishing between changes in asset prices dominated by fundamental forces and those driven by non-fundamental forces, policymakers should not target asset prices or try to guide them to the policymakers' estimate of fundamental value.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.8195323944091797
The discussion of the paper by Rudy Dornbusch and comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan added an important additional theme related to monetary policy and equity prices.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.933487594127655
So it is with equity prices.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8465718030929565
Monetary policymakers sometimes face additional problems in the case of such steep declines in asset values.,1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.8480779528617859

"Chairman Greenspan commented that markets are asymmetric, not monetary policy.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9298632740974426
He emphasized that monetary policy does not operate with a target for equity prices when they are falling any more than it does when equity prices are rising.,1999-10-12,STABLE,0.8281670808792114
"In both cases, monetary policy responds only indirectly to equity prices, by taking equity prices into account in the assessment of aggregate demand.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9295108914375305
"But monetary policy has to respond quickly to the special circumstances that accompany a collapse of asset values, specifically the extreme illiquidity and seizing up of credit markets.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.9755221009254456
"Globalization and Monetary Policy: Choosing Exchange Rate and Monetary Policy Regimes The world economy has become increasingly globalized over the last couple of decades, measured both by the flow of trade among countries and especially by the flow of international capital.",1999-10-12,STABLE,0.9434516429901123
"An important challenge facing central banks around the world is how this globalization has affected their ability to pursue domestic objectives with monetary policy and, indeed, whether it is even possible to preserve an independent monetary policy.",1999-10-12,NO-EFFECT,0.5742988586425781

"With a diminished reservoir of conventional policy space, it is much more likely than was appreciated in 2012 that, in economic downturns, the effective lower bound (ELB) will constrain the ability of the FOMC to rely solely on the federal funds rate instrument to offset adverse shocks.6 This development, in turn, makes it more likely that recessions will impart elevated risks of more persistent downward pressure on inflation and upward pressure on unemployment that the Federal Reserve's monetary policy should, in design and implementation, seek to offset throughout the business cycle and not just in downturns themselves.7 Two other, related developments that have also become more evident than they appeared in 2012 are that price inflation seems less responsive to resource slack, and also, that estimates of resource slack based on historically estimated price Phillips curve relationships are less reliable and subject to more material revision than was once commonly believed.8 For example, in the face of declining unemployment rates that did not result in excessive cost-push pressure to price inflation, the median of the Committee's projections of u*â€”the rate of unemployment consistent in the longer run with the 2 percent inflation objectiveâ€”has been repeatedly revised lower, from 5.5 percent in January 2012 to 4.1 percent as of the June 2020 SEP.9 Projections of u* by the Congressional Budget Office and professional forecasters show a similar decline during this same period and for the same reason.10 In the past several years of the previous expansion, declines in the unemployment rate occurred in tandem with a notable and, to me, welcome increase in real wages that was accompanied by an increase in labor's share of national income, but not a surge in price inflation to a pace inconsistent with our price-stability mandate and well-anchored inflation expectations.",2020-08-31,NO-EFFECT,0.9959230422973633
"Indeed, this pattern of mid-cycle declines in unemployment coincident with noninflationary increases in real wages has been evident in the U.S. data since the 1990s.11 With regard to inflation expectations, there is broad agreement among academics and policymakers that achieving price stability on a sustainable basis requires that inflation expectations be well anchored at the rate of inflation consistent with the price-stability goal.",2020-08-31,STABLE,0.6655948758125305
"This is especially true in the world that prevails today, with flat Phillips curves in which the primary determinant of actual inflation is expected inflation.12 The pre-GFC academic literature derived the important result that a credible inflation-targeting monetary policy strategy that is not constrained by the ELB can deliver, under rational expectations, inflation expectations that themselves are well anchored at the inflation target.13 In other words, absent a binding ELB constraint, a policy that targets actual inflation in these models delivers long-run inflation expectations well anchored at the target ""for free.""",2020-08-31,STABLE,0.9266835451126099

"In this case, which is obviously relevant today, economic analysis indicates that flexible inflation-targeting monetary policy cannot be relied on to deliver inflation expectations that are anchored at the target, but instead will tend to deliver inflation expectations that, in each business cycle, become anchored at a level below the target.14 This is the crucial insight in my colleague John Williams' research with Thomas Mertens.",2020-08-31,STABLE,0.4933561682701111

This downward bias in inflation expectations under inflation targeting in an ELB world can in turn reduce already scarce policy spaceâ€”because nominal interest rates reflect both real rates and expected inflationâ€”and it can open up the risk of the downward spiral in both actual and expected inflation that has been observed in some other major economies.,2020-08-31,NO-EFFECT,0.9956918358802795

"Finally, because the effect of monetary policy on the economy operates with a lag, our strategy remains forward looking.",2020-08-31,STABLE,0.7555407881736755
"With respect to the new framework itself, the statement now notes that the neutral level of the federal funds rate has declined relative to its historical average and therefore that the policy rate is more likely than in the past to be constrained by its ELB, and, moreover, that this binding ELB constraint is likely to impart downside risks to inflation and employment that the Committee needs to consider in implementing its monetary policy strategy.",2020-08-31,NO-EFFECT,0.9969280362129211

"""23 This change conveys our judgment that a low unemployment rate by itself, in the absence of evidence that price inflation is running or is likely to run persistently above mandate-consistent levels or pressing financial stability concerns, will not, under our new framework, be a sufficient trigger for policy action.24 This is a robust evolution in the Federal Reserve's policy framework and, to me, reflects the reality that econometric models of maximum employment, while essential inputs to monetary policy, can be and have been wrong, and, moreover, that a decision to tighten monetary policy based solely on a model without any other evidence of excessive cost-push pressure that puts the price-stability mandate at risk is difficult to justify, given the significant cost to the economy if the model turns out to be wrong and given the ability of monetary policy to respond if the model were eventually to turn out to be right.25 With regard to the price-stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importanceâ€”and the challengeâ€”of keeping inflation expectations ""well anchored at 2 percent"" (and not just ""well anchored"") in a world of low r* and an ELB constraint that is binding in downturns.26 To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at 2 percent, it ""seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time,"" andâ€”in the same sentenceâ€”that therefore ""following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.""",2020-08-31,NO-EFFECT,0.9772905707359314

The interpretation has important implications for how we should think about the conduct of monetary policy and what we think might happen to inflation over the next couple of years.,2007-03-23,NO-EFFECT,0.7878496050834656
"The Empirical Evidence on Changes in Inflation Dynamics To see what research has discovered about the evolution of inflation dynamics in recent years, letâ€™s explore the following questions: (1) What is the available evidence on changes in inflation persistence in recent years?",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9838532209396362
(3) What role do other variables play in the inflation process?,2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9427596926689148
"Inflation Persistence To answer the first question, we need to measure how long the effects of a shock to inflation will last.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9208733439445496
"Specifically, we need to know whether inflation tends to revert quickly to its initial level, or whether the effects of the shock persist--that is, lead to a changed level of inflation for an extended period.",2007-03-23,NO-EFFECT,0.8981984853744507
The most obvious way of measuring inflation persistence is to regress inflation on several of its own lags and then calculate the sum of the coefficients on lagged inflation.,2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9712234139442444
"If the sum of the coefficients is close to 1.0, then shocks to inflation have long-lived effects on inflation.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9030086398124695
"In other words, inflation behaves like a random walk, so that when inflation goes up, it stays up.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9595334529876709
"If the sum of the coefficients drops well below 1.0, then a shock to inflation has only a temporary effect on inflation, and inflation soon reverts back to its trend level.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.8478513360023499
The evidence from these so-called autoregressions with U.S. data suggests that inflation may have grown less persistent over time.,2007-03-23,STABLE,0.5825693607330322
"Figure 1 illustrates this tendency, with the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index as the measure of inflation.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9557904601097107
"Recent work by Jim Stock and Mark Watson (2007) provides an alternative and, to me, a quite intuitive way of thinking about inflation persistence.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9729374051094055
They estimate a model that decomposes inflation into two components.,2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9456664323806763
"The first component, which can be thought of as the underlying trend, follows a random walk, so that shocks to this component persist indefinitely and thus affect the trend inflation rate going forward.",2007-03-23,NO-EFFECT,0.5224566459655762
"When the relative importance of the trend shocks became high, as it did in the 1970s and early 1980s, inflation became highly persistent.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.79097980260849
"Under such conditions, if inflation went up, the trend component typically rose in tandem so that inflation stayed up.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.8988049626350403
"In contrast, when the temporary shocks were relatively more important, as was true before the 1970s and after the mid-1980s, a change in inflation tended to reflect a change in the temporary component, not the trend.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.8983462452888489
"As a result, fluctuations in inflation tended to fade away, implying that inflation persistence was much lower.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.5333184599876404
"In the context of the Stock-Watson model, then, when inflation rose to double-digit levels during the ""Great Inflation"" period of the 1970s and early 1980s, persistence became very high because the trend rate of inflation moved around a lot--that is, trend inflation became unanchored.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.8181973099708557
"For example, Cecchetti et al (2007) employ a slightly modified version of the Stock-Watson procedure in a recent paper and find that inflation persistence has fallen so low that their estimated trend for gross domestic product (GDP) price inflation has been almost perfectly flat at about 2.2 percent over the past few years.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9480187296867371
"Finally, follow-up work by staff members at the Federal Reserve Board suggests that the degree of persistence found with these techniques varies across different measures of inflation.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.95816969871521
"Nonetheless, I think it fair to say that inflation has become less persistent over the past two decades but that the underlying trend may not yet be perfectly stable.",2007-03-23,NO-EFFECT,0.9542618989944458
"In short, all these countries experienced a similar ""Great Inflation,"" when trend inflation became unanchored.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.8900396823883057
"Germany and Japan had shorter periods of high persistence of inflation, with persistence beginning to decline around 1969 in Germany and around 1979 in Japan.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.8908350467681885
Cecchetti and his co-authors conclude that the rise and subsequent decline of inflation persistence has thus been a worldwide phenomenon.,2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9451788663864136
"Slope of the Phillips Curve In traditional Phillips-curve equations, inflation depends on past values of inflation, an unemployment gap (the difference between the unemployment rate and an estimate of its natural rate), and variables such as the relative price of energy and import prices.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9633502960205078
"When researchers estimate these equations, they typically find that the coefficient on the unemployment gap has declined (in absolute value) since the 1980s, often by a marked amount.4 In other words, the evidence suggests that the Phillips curve has flattened.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9125928282737732
"The finding that inflation is less responsive to the unemployment gap, if taken at face value, suggests that fluctuations in resource utilization will have smaller implications for inflation than used to be the case.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.850020706653595
"From the point of view of policymakers, this development is a two-edged sword: On the plus side, it implies that an overheating economy will tend to generate a smaller increase in inflation.",2007-03-23,NO-EFFECT,0.4917636215686798
"On the negative side, however, a flatter Phillips curve also implies that a given increase in inflation will be more costly to wring out of the system.",2007-03-23,NO-EFFECT,0.8792220950126648
We can quantify this latter consideration using the so-called sacrifice ratio--the number of years that unemployment has to be 1.0 percentage point greater than its natural rate to reduce the inflation rate 1.0 percentage point.,2007-03-23,STABLE,0.938766360282898
"Averaging estimates obtained from a comprehensive battery of equation specifications suggests that the sacrifice ratio may be 40 percent larger--that is, it may be 40 percent more costly to reduce inflation than it was two decades ago.",2007-03-23,NO-EFFECT,0.5672346353530884
Role of Other Variables in the Inflation Process Empirical evidence suggests that inflation has also become less responsive to other shocks.,2007-03-23,STABLE,0.7598681449890137
"The two oil price shocks in the 1970s were associated with large jumps in core inflation, whereas recent surges in energy prices have not had a similar effect.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.8918562531471252
This reduced sensitivity manifests itself in traditional Phillips-curve models as a substantial decline in the estimated coefficient on the energy price term in these equations.,2007-03-23,STABLE,0.8751935958862305
"Because this term equals the change in relative energy prices multiplied by the share of energy in aggregate output, energy price effects on inflation appear to have fallen by more than can be accounted for by the greater energy efficiency of the economy.5 In contrast, unpublished empirical work by the staff at the Federal Reserve Board suggests that, once we take the rising share of imports into account, the influence of import prices on core inflation in the United States has not changed much in the context of reduced-form forecasting models.6 At the same time, the influence of exchange rate movements on import prices--the so-called pass-through effect--may have fallen substantially, at least according to some studies.7 If so, then the influence of exchange rate fluctuations on domestic inflation may now be less than it once was, when one controls for changes in the volume of our foreign trade.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.4825673997402191
What Interpretation Can We Give to Changes in Inflation Dynamics?,2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9348942637443542
"In interpreting these stylized facts about changes in inflation dynamics, we must first recognize that all of them are based on reduced-form relationships, and thus they are about correlations and not necessarily about true structural relationships.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9560328722000122
"Because the explanatory variables in inflation regressions are themselves influenced by changes in economic conditions, changes in the underlying monetary policy regime are likely to be a source of changes in reduced-form inflation dynamics.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.8061421513557434
"In such cases, we cannot use the reduced-form equations to disentangle the effects of such unobserved factors--which themselves may be driven by changes in monetary policy--from that of other influences.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9403820037841797
Theory tells us that inflation expectations must be a key driving force behind inflation.,2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9512302875518799
"This dependence has long been implicit in traditional Phillips-curve analysis, but expectations--now in explicit form--are also a central feature of the increasingly popular New Keynesian Phillips curves, in which current-period inflation is a function of expectations of next periodâ€™s inflation and resource utilization.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9496285915374756
"Therefore, a natural first place to look for explanations of changing inflation dynamics is a possible change in the expectations-formation process.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9278133511543274
"The first stylized fact discussed earlier is that inflation persistence, which rose in the 1970s during the Great Inflation, has since declined to a much lower level.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.926254391670227
"An intuitive way of thinking about this rise and fall in inflation persistence is that it resulted from an un-anchoring of trend inflation during the period of the Great Inflation, and a re-anchoring in recent years, as the work of Stock and Watson suggests.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.937727153301239
"When we think about what drives trend inflation, inflation expectations--particularly long-run expectations--come to mind.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9473662376403809
"A de-anchoring of inflation expectations would surely lead to trend inflation becoming unanchored, whereas an anchoring of inflation expectations at a particular level would necessarily lead to a stabilization of trend inflation and hence a decline in inflation persistence.",2007-03-23,NO-EFFECT,0.8595974445343018
Do indicators of inflation expectations support this story?,2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9013946056365967
Consider the measure of expected inflation for the coming twelve months reported by the Livingston survey.,2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9275158047676086
"As illustrated by the dashed line in figure 3 , this measure of expected short-run inflation--adjusted by a constant factor to convert it from a CPI basis to a PCE basis--soared during the 1970s and then fell back markedly during the 1980s and early 1990s.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9358534216880798
"Over the past few years, the short-run series has fluctuated around 2 percent, with its month-to-month movements correlated with swings in energy prices, as one might expect.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.8769894242286682
"An even more striking story is told by the survey-based measure of expected long-run inflation used in the FRB/US model, the dotted blue line in figure 3.8 When we look at this long-run series (which should be more closely related to expectations about policy objectives than the short-run measure), we see that the publicâ€™s expectations stood at a high level of 7-3/4 percent at the start of the 1980s, when this information first began to be collected.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9559082388877869
Estimates of inflation compensation derived from indexed Treasury yields have also been remarkably stable in recent years.,2007-03-23,STABLE,0.8424606323242188
Figure 3 also reproduces the estimate of trend inflation produced by the Stock-Watson procedure (the solid line).,2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9711552858352661
"As you can see, this series more or less tracks the survey-based measures of long-run expectations, suggesting that the anchoring of long-run inflation expectations in recent years may explain the finding of a marked decline in inflation persistence.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.77213454246521
Anchoring of inflation expectations is not a deus ex machina.,2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9188910722732544
"It must come from somewhere, and since Milton Friedmanâ€™s adage that â€œ[i]nflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenonâ€ is still true, monetary policy must be the source of the change in the evolution of long-run inflation expectations.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9158385992050171
"During the 1960s and 1970s, the Federal Reserve and a number of other central banks maintained a policy stance that, inadvertently or not, was too easy on average and that allowed both actual and expected inflation to drift up markedly over many years.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.7451378107070923

"The Fed pursued preemptive strikes against rises in inflation in 1994-95, 1999-00, and in 2004-06, as well as preemptive strikes against potentially deflationary forces in the fall of 1998 and in 2001-04.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9093166589736938
"The result has been not only low and stable inflation but also, as we have seen, a strong anchoring of long-run inflation expectations.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.8082974553108215
The pursuit of more-aggressive monetary policy to control inflation and the achievement of anchored inflation expectations can also help explain the other stylized facts about inflation dynamics.,2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9059332013130188
"With expectations of inflation anchored, any given shock to inflation--whether it is from aggregate demand, energy prices, or the foreign exchange rate--will have a smaller effect on expected inflation and hence on trend inflation.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.5613587498664856
These shocks will then have a much less persistent effect on actual inflation.,2007-03-23,STABLE,0.6485174298286438
The recent experience with surging oil prices seems consistent with this story.,2007-03-23,STABLE,0.7767034769058228
The price of West Texas intermediate crude oil rose from about $30 per barrel in late 2003 to a peak of almost $75 per barrel in July of last year.,2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9025598764419556
"During this episode, inflation appears to have been boosted only temporarily and by a strikingly small amount, in contrast to the 1970s when oil price shocks led to large, persistent increases in inflation.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.7640689611434937
"Interestingly, monetary policy could have worked to flatten the estimated Phillips curve even without these favorable expectational effects, simply by moving more aggressively to stabilize both inflation and output.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.6826218366622925
"Thus, a monetary policy that more successfully stabilizes inflation and resource utilization could well lead to a smaller estimated coefficient on unemployment gaps in a traditional Phillips-curve equation.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.5005999207496643
"In particular, their analyses suggest that changes in the way the Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy--including changes in both the parameters of monetary policy reaction functions and the volatility of shocks to those functions--may account for most of the reduction in the coefficients on resource utilization in traditional Phillips curves.9 What is particularly attractive about highlighting a better anchoring of inflation expectations as probably the primary factor driving the changes in inflation dynamics is that this one explanation covers so many of the stylized facts--an application of Occamâ€™s razor.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9186143279075623
"Indeed, I have always become more confident in a theory if it can explain a number of very different facts.10 This is why I am so attracted to the view that inflation expectations are a key driving factor in the inflation process.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9660109281539917
"Of course, many other factors also influence inflation, and some of these provide other possible explanations for the recent changes in inflation dynamics.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.9372681379318237

"In the context of a low-inflation environment, firms may have concluded that they can leave their prices fixed for longer periods at little cost, causing inflation to be less responsive to shocks, particularly if they are transitory.",2007-03-23,NO-EFFECT,0.5241411924362183
"In this way, monetary policy may have affected the slope of the Phillips curve without having affected the manner in which expectations are formed.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.91216641664505
"Also, from the mid-1980s through the first years of this decade, energy price movements were smaller and more transitory.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.8866245150566101
"We see this in futures markets, in which oil prices in far-dated futures contracts moved much less than spot prices over this period, suggesting that people expected a quick reversal in any rise in oil prices.",2007-03-23,STABLE,0.5825591087341309
Such transitory shocks to energy price would presumably have a smaller effect on inflation than the more-persistent oil price shocks of the 1970s and early 1980s.,2007-03-23,STABLE,0.8990676999092102

Productivity Growth and Cost Reductions So how did this confluence of positive events come about?,2001-06-14,STABLE,0.88132643699646

Research by Federal Reserve Board economists Steve Oliner and Dan Sichel sheds some light on the sources of this faster productivity growth.,2001-06-14,STABLE,0.9516816139221191
The high (and rising) levels of business investment raised the amount of capital per worker and thereby boosted productivity.,2001-06-14,STABLE,0.7532283067703247
"About 1/2 percentage point of the increase in productivity growth over the 1995-99 period can be attributed to this so-called ""capital deepening,"" most of which reflected greater spending by businesses on computers, software, and communications equipment.",2001-06-14,STABLE,0.9226219654083252
Oliner and Sichel estimate that the consolidated influences of information technology investments account for about two-thirds of the acceleration in productivity since 1995.,2001-06-14,STABLE,0.9457299709320068

A further complication is that inflation risk premiums are not constant but instead appear to vary over time as economic circumstances change.,2004-04-15,STABLE,0.7803171873092651
"Second, although the issuance of inflation-protected securities has risen significantly, the outstanding quantities of these securities remain much smaller than those of conventional Treasury securities.",2004-04-15,STABLE,0.751749575138092
"All else equal, the likely presence of a liquidity premium in the TIPS return tends to make breakeven inflation an underestimate of expected inflation, thus offsetting to some degree the effect of the inflation risk premium.3 Like inflation risk premiums, liquidity premiums on TIPS appear to vary over time, further complicating the interpretation of breakeven inflation.",2004-04-15,STABLE,0.6261236071586609
"Hence, an indexed security typically has a longer duration with respect to real interest rate changes than does the nominal security, a difference that affects the relative riskiness of real and nominal securities.4 More generally, because TIPS returns are imperfectly correlated with the yields on both nominal Treasuries and stocks, some investors demand TIPS for general diversification purposes--a demand that appears to have increased significantly as investors have become more familiar with this new type of asset.",2004-04-15,STABLE,0.8378716111183167
"As the supply of TIPS has been fairly limited, the rise in demand by institutional investors and others may push down the equilibrium real return on TIPS and thus raise measures of breakeven inflation.5 A separate issue that bears on the relevance of breakeven inflation for policymaking is that TIPS returns depend on the overall consumer price index (CPI), whereas for many purposes policymakers are more interested in the behavior of core inflation, a measure of inflation that strips out volatile food and energy prices.",2004-04-15,NO-EFFECT,0.9525315165519714

Interest Rates and Spreads as Leading Indicators An alternative approach to extracting information from financial markets is to examine a range of asset prices and yields to determine whether they are useful as leading indicators of economic developments.,2004-04-15,STABLE,0.9430859684944153

Monetary Policy and Productivity Shocks The effect of a productivity shock on the balance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply (or equivalently on the balance between natural and market rates) depends importantly on the conduct of monetary policy.,2000-04-12,STABLE,0.945817232131958

"Levine and Renelt (1992), for example, found no robust relationship in exhaustive cross-section studies, and many researchers using other techniques have also failed to detect a significant relationship.10 The problem may lie in identifying the direction of causation: In the short-to-medium run, causality may run from higher growth to higher inflation, as business-cycle pressures push spending and activity above the economy's capacity.",2005-11-03,NO-EFFECT,0.5927836298942566

The question you and I might be asking right now is: What is a monetary policymaker doing here?,2000-02-23,STABLE,0.9298486113548279
"My assignment is to answer this question: How do the prevailing surplus and, especially, decisions about the allocation of future potential surpluses affect the formulation and conduct of monetary policy?",2000-02-23,STABLE,0.9585245251655579
"Using this concept will allow us to focus on the implications of alternative combinations of monetary and fiscal policies--yielding the same level of aggregate demand--for the real interest rate, the composition of output, and the current account balance.",2000-02-23,STABLE,0.9378676414489746
"However, other important features of recent macroeconomic experience--specifically the absence of a large decline in real interest rates and the significant deterioration in the current account balance--appear at least superficially inconsistent with the predictions from the standard analytics.",2000-02-23,NO-EFFECT,0.8472331762313843
Perhaps even more important are other developments that have affected real interest rates and the current account balance over the same period.,2000-02-23,STABLE,0.9268875122070312
"I conclude by discussing the implications for monetary policy of options for the allocation of the ""potential"" surplus.",2000-02-23,STABLE,0.9388945698738098
I focus on two ways in which fiscal policy choices could affect monetary policy.,2000-02-23,STABLE,0.9172080755233765
"First, fiscal policy choices will affect the interest rate consistent with full employment and price stability.",2000-02-23,STABLE,0.7728024125099182
"Second, a gradual reduction and ultimate retirement of the federal government debt would require changes in the way monetary policy is implemented.",2000-02-23,NO-EFFECT,0.5847405195236206

The IS curve shows the combinations of interest rate (R) and output (Y) consistent with equilibrium in the output market.,2000-02-23,STABLE,0.93487948179245
The LM curve shows the combinations of interest rate and output consistent with equilibrium in the market for money.,2000-02-23,STABLE,0.9458510279655457
The intersection of the curve shows the unique combination of the interest rate and output consistent with equilibrium in all markets simultaneously.,2000-02-23,STABLE,0.9513049721717834
Let's start from a simple case in which the level of capacity is given at a moment in time and the intersection of IS and LM curves determines the prevailing level of aggregate demand.,2000-02-23,STABLE,0.9279056191444397

Evaluating alternative fiscal policies at an unchanged level of output--and specifically at potential output--also allows us to abstract from cyclical changes in the deficit and thereby to focus exclusively on changes in the structural budget balance.,2000-02-23,STABLE,0.8464488983154297
The position of the LM curve is determined in part by the stance of monetary policy.,2000-02-23,STABLE,0.8765573501586914

"A combination of tighter fiscal and looser monetary policy (point A compared with point B in figure 1 (6 KB)) implies a lower interest rate, a higher share of investment (and, in general, of interest-sensitive components of spending) in GDP, a lower value of the dollar, and a higher level of net exports and hence of the current account surplus.",2000-02-23,STABLE,0.7548287510871887

The Politics of the Policy Mix: Does Monetary Policy Respond to Fiscal Policy?,2000-02-23,STABLE,0.9197852611541748
"Over the last 20 years, these decisions generally have been based on considerations that have more to do with long-run objectives such as promotion of higher longer-term growth, than with short-run stabilization.",2000-02-23,STABLE,0.8691156506538391
"The Federal Reserve then sets its policy to achieve the broad objectives assigned to it, specifically, price stability and full employment.",2000-02-23,STABLE,0.8769182562828064
"Fiscal decisions are, in turn, affected by budget forecasts that are partly contingent on monetary policy assumptions.",2000-02-23,STABLE,0.8803155422210693
"Monetary policymakers smooth the transition to the new equilibrium, by minimizing the effect on output relative to full employment and on prices.",2000-02-23,STABLE,0.7865068912506104
"Because monetary policy adjusts continuously to changes in the economy, including those resulting from fiscal policy, it makes sense to think that fiscal policy decisions are made first and monetary policy decisions are conditional on the fiscal decisions.",2000-02-23,STABLE,0.9201962947845459
So does this mean that monetary policy responds directly to fiscal policy actions?,2000-02-23,STABLE,0.9079101085662842
"That is, monetary policy responds to changes in fiscal policy in much the same way that it responds to other influences on the economy, such as equity prices, exchange rates, or the demand for U.S. exports due to changed growth prospects abroad.",2000-02-23,STABLE,0.889243483543396
Each and all of these developments affect both the macroeconomic developments and the forecast that drive adjustments in monetary policy in pursuit of full employment and price stability.,2000-02-23,STABLE,0.8682124614715576
It is also important not to overstate the role monetary policy plays in shaping the policy mix.,2000-02-23,STABLE,0.8630329966545105
"In terms of our diagram, the game is fundamentally over when the fiscal decision pins down the intersection of the IS curve and the vertical line at full employment.",2000-02-23,STABLE,0.610546350479126
"One possibility, of course, is that the Federal Reserve adjusts its open market operations to move the interest rate to this point.",2000-02-23,STABLE,0.6442280411720276
"In a regime in which the Fed implements policy by choosing a target for the money stock, either the money stock could be adjusted to move the LM curve to this point, or price flexibility would ultimately get the job done, with the emphasis on the ultimately.",2000-02-23,STABLE,0.6305195689201355
"The role of active monetary policy is to avoid the need for price flexibility--that is, to prevent the fiscal decision from either temporarily lowering output below its full employment level or permanently increasing prices.",2000-02-23,STABLE,0.8118353486061096
"Under a plausible policy rule--for example, utilizing actual or forecast output gaps and inflation rates--the interest rate would be reset over time until it was consistent with the intersection of the IS curve and the vertical line at potential output and price stability.",2000-02-23,STABLE,0.9054752588272095
The message of such an interest rate rule is that monetary policy responds only indirectly to fiscal policy.,2000-02-23,STABLE,0.9354217648506165
"That is, the rule specifies the adjustment of the interest rate to changes in output and prices (the indirect approach), not the adjustment to changes in tax rates or spending (as would be the case in a direct approach).",2000-02-23,STABLE,0.9265358448028564
"However, if we look at the reduced form equation for the now endogenous monetary policy instrument, we shall, to be sure, find--lurking on the right-hand side--the exogenous components of the fiscal policy decision--the level of discretionary spending and the benefit and tax rates.",2000-02-23,STABLE,0.8036232590675354

"The key to getting the right answer in the analysis is to identify correctly the multiple shocks that induced the swing in the ratio of deficit to GDP and that affected the real interest rate and current account, as well as to take into account the effect of the cyclical developments.",2000-02-23,STABLE,0.9364629983901978
I assumed in the analytics of the policy mix that that any non-cyclical change in the deficit was due to a change in policy--some combination of increases in tax rates and cutbacks in government spending.,2000-02-23,STABLE,0.8585333824157715

"For example, if tax rates are constant and government spending remains a constant share of GDP, then the higher productivity trend will, in general, yield a higher equilibrium real interest rate.",2000-02-23,STABLE,0.9149128198623657
"However, if real (or nominal) government spending is held constant, the surplus will rise over time as a share of GDP, putting downward pressure on the equilibrium real rate, offsetting, at least in part, the effect on the real rate of the higher trend productivity.",2000-02-23,NO-EFFECT,0.9469254612922668

"Rather, my assignment is to connect fiscal and monetary policy decisions.",2000-02-23,STABLE,0.9128866195678711
I have emphasized the value of evaluating fiscal policy options in models that incorporate reasonable monetary policy reaction functions.,2000-02-23,STABLE,0.917493462562561

The Implications of Debt Retirement for Monetary Policy Operations One additional consequence of the choice among these options is that preserving the surpluses would lead to a gradual decline in and ultimately the retirement of the federal government debt.,2000-02-23,STABLE,0.5600001215934753
"The prospects for such an outcome depend, of course, on the realized growth rate of income and hence tax revenue and one's assumption about the starting base of expenditures and the appropriate baseline for its rate of growth.",2000-02-23,STABLE,0.820841372013092

Some have been concerned that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury might be working at cross purposes today to the extent that reductions in the Treasury debt supply have lead to declines in longer-term Treasury rates at a time when monetary policy is aiming to slow the pace of economic activity to a more sustainable rate.,2000-02-23,NO-EFFECT,0.9732445478439331

One of the key variables to be forecast is inflation.,2004-03-27,STABLE,0.8803828954696655
"A variety of approaches to forecasting inflation are used at the Board, of course.",2004-03-27,STABLE,0.9031394124031067
One of Dick Porter's many contributions was to develop a monetary approach to forecasting inflation at medium-term horizons.,2004-03-27,STABLE,0.9473397135734558
"That equation is of course the quantity equation, MV = PY, or money times velocity equals the price level times output.",2004-03-27,STABLE,0.9137861728668213
This equation can be used to define a link between money growth and inflation that depends on the evolution of the velocity of money.,2004-03-27,STABLE,0.9544169306755066
"This approach seems to work reasonably well at predicting inflation at medium-term horizons, and the forecasts of this model are reported routinely to the Board of Governors.",2004-03-27,STABLE,0.9619762301445007
"Because good forecasts are so crucial to good monetary policy, I hope and expect to see a great deal more work exploring the robustness of alternative forecasting methods.",2004-03-27,STABLE,0.9582623839378357
"For example, a rich recent literature on learning and macroeconomics has emphasized that actual inflation and inflation expectations may to some degree evolve independently, and that effective monetary policy stabilizes inflation expectations as well as inflation itself (Orphanides and Williams, 2003).",2004-03-27,STABLE,0.9507865309715271

Nothing gives a firm pricing leverage like excess demand.,1997-09-17,STABLE,0.8426392674446106
"In addition, the resulting inability of firms to pass on higher costs in higher prices likely has altered the way firms operate in the labor market, making them more reluctant to bid aggressively for workers, contributing to a slower rate of increase in wages than we would otherwise have expected at prevailing labor utilization rates.",1997-09-17,NO-EFFECT,0.9895221590995789

"Possibilities The most intriguing explanations for the recent favorable performance are structural changes, which may have relaxed the capacity constraints that are the core of the cyclical regularities story, or made these constraints more flexible than in the past, or tempered the ability and/or willingness of firms to respond to excess demand by raising wages and prices.",1997-09-17,NO-EFFECT,0.9678776264190674
"There are two possibilities that have been widely discussed: that the economy can now sustain a lower unemployment rate without rising inflation (i.e., that NAIRU has declined) and that, once capacity has been reached, the economy is now capable of faster growth, compared to the estimates of trend growth reported earlier.",1997-09-17,NO-EFFECT,0.8623040914535522
"A lot of the discussion about this episode focuses on sorting out the relative importance of the two possibilities -- specifically, whether the recent favorable performance is due more to labor market structural change, as reflected in a lower NAIRU, or to product market structural change, as reflected in a higher rate of growth in productivity.",1997-09-17,STABLE,0.683227002620697

Has there been an increase in trend productivity?,1997-09-17,STABLE,0.8125124573707581
Another possibility is that the trend rate of increase in productivity -- and hence the economy's sustainable rate of growth in GDP -- has recently increased.,1997-09-17,STABLE,0.8136314749717712
There is some confusion in many discussions of productivity growth about the implications of measurement bias.,1997-09-17,STABLE,0.8631675839424133
"It is widely accepted that there is a downward bias in measured productivity growth, the mirror image of the upward bias in measured inflation.",1997-09-17,STABLE,0.8097808361053467
The measurement issue is relevant to explaining the inflation-unemployment experience in the current episode only if the bias has recently become more serious.,1997-09-17,STABLE,0.6843944191932678
"Note also that if the measurement bias has increased, this would imply that both actual and potential output growth are higher than reported, with no obvious implication for the gap between actual and potential output, and hence for inflation pressures.",1997-09-17,STABLE,0.8686382174491882
"Sources of higher productivity growth, all of which should show up in measured productivity, include a return on years of corporate restructuring and the increase in capital per worker associated with the current investment boom, much of which is linked to technological change, specifically the information revolution.",1997-09-17,STABLE,0.8455982804298401
No other explanation has the ability to explain as many features of the current experience as an increase in trend productivity.,1997-09-17,STABLE,0.9512060284614563
"There are, however, some problems with this story as the principal explanation for the favorable inflation performance.",1997-09-17,NO-EFFECT,0.6539020538330078
"First, a productivity explanation would resonate better if the puzzle were why higher wage change was not being passed on in higher prices.",1997-09-17,STABLE,0.7864370346069336
But the greater puzzle is the slow pace of increase in compensation per hour at prevailing unemployment rates.,1997-09-17,STABLE,0.6506702899932861

"And the rate of growth over the last year, even with the sharp upward revision in the second quarter, is 1.2%, just above the 1.1% average rate of increase over the period from the early 1970s up to the beginning of this expansion.",1997-09-17,STABLE,0.8118389248847961
"For example, the acceleration in productivity to a 1.2% rate over the last year, at a time when the unemployment rate was dropping to a level that would suggest less productive workers were being drawn on, leaves open the possibility that the productivity trend has quickened.",1997-09-17,NO-EFFECT,0.8819486498832703
Perhaps the strongest case for an increase in the productivity trend comes from the higher rate of growth over the past two years if productivity is measured from the income side of the national accounts.,1997-09-17,STABLE,0.8892931342124939

The Challenge for Monetary Policy Some day we shall look back on this episode with historical perspective and perhaps -- and only perhaps -- have a better ability to sort out what contributed to the favorable outcome and the extent to which the prevailing coexistence of low unemployment and stable low inflation proved permanent or transitory.,1997-09-17,NO-EFFECT,0.7118642926216125

So one of the challenges to monetary policy is how to operate when there is a higher degree of uncertainty about where NAIRU is.,1996-09-08,NO-EFFECT,0.8106963038444519
I have emphasized throughout my career the importance of the expectations-augmented Phillips Curve in my view of the inflation process and its value as a forecasting tool.,1996-09-08,STABLE,0.9530540108680725
But the tension is there and we have to weigh the risk of higher inflation if the longer-run estimate of NAIRU proves correct against the potential that the recent stability in inflation reflects a change in structure that will persist.,1996-09-08,NO-EFFECT,0.9897200465202332
Tempering some of the optimism about NAIRU and recent inflation is evidence of at least a modest acceleration in wages and compensation.,1996-09-08,NO-EFFECT,0.7712222933769226

Juggling Multiple Targets in the Short Run But this is just a single episode for monetary policy.,1996-09-08,STABLE,0.7771890163421631
"Let's assume, for the sake of the rest of my remarks, that growth slows to trend, the unemployment rate stabilizes at its current level, and inflation remains stable.",1996-09-08,STABLE,0.8710177540779114
What then for monetary policy?,1996-09-08,STABLE,0.9092222452163696
"There is, to be sure, no trade-off and hence no inconsistency between full employment and price stability in the long run.",1996-09-08,STABLE,0.9000330567359924

Full employment can be achieved either with price stability or with positive stable inflation.,1996-09-08,STABLE,0.8526967167854309

"That still leaves us the strategic question of how to juggle the goals of full employment and price stability in the short run when the initial conditions do involve a conflict among the ultimate objectives--for example, the current combination of modest, stable inflation and full employment.",1996-09-08,NO-EFFECT,0.9527222514152527
It is desirable that monetary policy respond to this challenge in a systematic way.,1996-09-08,STABLE,0.5098535418510437
This would allow the private sector to both anticipate where monetary policy is headed and retain confidence that the Federal Reserve remains focused on its long-run objective as it carries out its meeting-to-meeting policies.,1996-09-08,STABLE,0.46726861596107483
The Taylor Rule is a simple example of a strategy that juggles the two objectives in a disciplined manner without losing sight of the long-run price stability objective.,1996-09-08,STABLE,0.924074113368988
The Taylor Rule varies the real federal funds rate relative to some equilibrium level in response to both the deviation of output from its full employment level and of inflation from its long-run target.,1996-09-08,STABLE,0.9165244102478027
"This rule, in effect, worries continuously about both output relative to potential and inflation relative to price stability.",1996-09-08,STABLE,0.6212984919548035
But the Taylor Rule helps illustrate some important aspects of monetary policy strategy.,1996-09-08,STABLE,0.9654886722564697
"The Taylor Rule would resolve the near-term conflict between objectives in the current economic environment by encouraging some slack in the economy and thereby ensuring downward pressure on inflation over time, as long as inflation were above the long-run inflation target, while still balancing along the way both the inflation and employment objectives.",1996-09-08,NO-EFFECT,0.5081287622451782
"Opportunistic Disinflation A couple of years ago, I gave the name ""opportunistic disinflation"" to an alternative strategy for bridging between short-run policy and long-run goals, a strategy that I observed the Federal Reserve to be following at the time.",1996-09-08,STABLE,0.9550372362136841
"Under this strategy, once inflation becomes modest, as today, Federal Reserve policy in the near term focuses on sustaining trend growth at full employment at the prevailing inflation rate.",1996-09-08,STABLE,0.5645695924758911
At this point the short-run priorities are twofold: sustaining the expansion and preventing an acceleration of inflation.,1996-09-08,STABLE,0.7433784604072571
"This is, nevertheless, a strategy for disinflation because it takes advantage of the opportunity of inevitable recessions and potential positive supply shocks to ratchet down inflation over time.",1996-09-08,NO-EFFECT,0.5153439044952393
Proponents of this strategy sometimes describe this approach as reducing inflation cycle-to-cycle or describe the economy as being one recession from price stability.,1996-09-08,STABLE,0.5720252394676208
"Under this strategy, if growth were to slow to trend, the unemployment rate were to remain where it is, and inflation were to remain stable, monetary policy would remain on hold, ready to respond aggressively to any acceleration of inflation, but otherwise prepared to be patient and accept the lower inflation that will accompany the next recession or favorable supply shock.",1996-09-08,NO-EFFECT,0.9810390472412109
So let me sum up how I look at the challenges facing monetary policy in the current economic environment and in light of the longer run strategic issues I have set out this evening.,1996-09-08,STABLE,0.8707377910614014
"In the near term, I believe we should be vigilant to insure that the progress made to lower inflation to the current level is sustained.",1996-09-08,NO-EFFECT,0.9855340719223022
"I am, as a result, focused on forecasts of near-term growth relative to trend as a forward-looking indicator of changes in utilization rates, on utilization rates themselves as forward-looking indicators of inflation pressures, on labor costs as a key factor in the transmission of demand pressure to price inflation, and, given the uncertainty about NAIRU, on readings of the current inflation rate.",1996-09-08,NO-EFFECT,0.983662486076355
"In that spirit, I will provide a brief progress report on the economic recovery, as well as some remarks on the evolution of monetary policy.",2004-01-04,STABLE,0.9091922640800476
"Though officially the recession lasted only eight months, from March to November 2001, a period of economic underperformance began with the sharp decline in stock prices and business investment in mid-2000 and continued through the months leading up to the Iraq war this past spring.",2004-01-04,STABLE,0.642953634262085
"In an effort to restore profitability in an environment of weak demand and nonexistent pricing power, businesses also worked hard to improve efficiency and cut costs.",2004-01-04,NO-EFFECT,0.6252567768096924
"These efforts have paid off in terms of remarkable increases in productivity, but, together with insufficient growth in aggregate demand, they also contributed to a significant decline in employment.",2004-01-04,NO-EFFECT,0.7394663691520691

"Monetary policy was deployed to support the weakening economy, as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) aggressively cut rates in 2001 and has continued its policy of accommodation since then.",2004-01-04,STABLE,0.8464082479476929
"As you know, the third quarter of the year displayed near-record levels of real economic growth, in the vicinity of 8 percent at an annual rate, and growth appears to have continued strong in the fourth quarter of 2003.",2004-01-04,STABLE,0.8769986629486084

"The positive case for maintaining an accommodative monetary policy at this stage of the recovery has three elements, some of which will be familiar to many of you, at least in broad outline.",2004-01-04,STABLE,0.8572359085083008
"First, core inflation rates in the United States are as low today as they have been in forty years, and they have been trending downward.",2004-01-04,STABLE,0.8162184357643127
"For example, the twelve-month inflation rate as measured by the consumer price index, current-methods basis and excluding food and energy prices, was 2.7 percent at the recession trough in November 2001.",2004-01-04,STABLE,0.9270403385162354
This measure of core inflation fell to 2.0 percent as of November 2002 and to only 1.1 percent as of November 2003.,2004-01-04,STABLE,0.9192157983779907
"Other measures of core inflation, such as the one based on the chain price index for personal consumption expenditures, have displayed a similar pattern.",2004-01-04,STABLE,0.8885546326637268
"Inflation is not simply low; for my taste, it is very nearly at the bottom of the acceptable range for (measured) inflation.",2004-01-04,STABLE,0.812498927116394
"In contrast, in previous episodes of recovery, inflation was above the range consistent with price stability, so that a tightening of monetary policy at an earlier stage of the expansion represented the prudent response to inflation risks.",2004-01-04,NO-EFFECT,0.891867995262146
"Because inflation is so low today, monetary policy can afford to be more patient to ensure that the recovery is self-sustaining.",2004-01-04,STABLE,0.617023766040802
The second unusual aspect of the current situation relevant for monetary policy is the truly remarkable increase in labor productivity that firms and workers have achieved in recent years.,2004-01-04,STABLE,0.889069676399231
"Those productivity increases affect the inflation outlook in two related ways: first, by raising potential output and thus (for given growth in aggregate demand) the size of the output gap; and, second, by reducing the costs of production, which puts downward pressure on prices.",2004-01-04,STABLE,0.7418375611305237
"I will first address the effect of productivity on costs, returning later to the link of productivity and the output gap.",2004-01-04,STABLE,0.9406286478042603
"When the cost per hour of employing a worker rises more quickly than the worker's hourly productivity--the historically normal situation--then the dollar labor cost of producing each unit of output, the so-called unit labor cost, tends to rise.",2004-01-04,STABLE,0.6047916412353516
"Recently, however, labor productivity has grown even more quickly than the costs of employing workers, with the result that unit labor costs have declined in each of the past three years.",2004-01-04,STABLE,0.49996447563171387
"A decline in production costs must result in lower prices for final consumers, an increased price-cost markup for producers, or both.",2004-01-04,NO-EFFECT,0.6976684331893921
"In practice, both have occurred in recent years: Firms have passed on part of the reduction in costs on to final consumers in the form of lower (or more slowly rising) prices, and price-cost markups (as best we can measure them) have risen well above their historical averages.",2004-01-04,NO-EFFECT,0.8729356527328491
"To the extent that product-market competition erodes these markups, as is likely to occur over time, downward pressure will be exerted on the inflation rate, even if, as is likely, the recent declines in unit labor cost do not persist.2 The third unusual factor is the persistent softness of the labor market.",2004-01-04,NO-EFFECT,0.9962159991264343
"As I already noted, fully two years after the official recession trough, we are only just beginning to see significant gains in employment.",2004-01-04,NO-EFFECT,0.659507155418396
"Of course, the unemployment rate, at about 6 percent of the labor force, is not exceptionally high by historical standards, and one can debate the degree to which structural change and other factors may have affected the level of employment that can be sustained without overheating the economy.",2004-01-04,STABLE,0.5561707615852356

"Similarly, the ratio of employment to the working-age population, a statistic that reflects both those who become unemployed and those who leave the labor force, has fallen significantly, by 2.8 percentage points between its peak in April 2000 and its trough this past September.",2004-01-04,STABLE,0.7158367037773132
"The tendency of recent job losers to leave the labor force likely masks some of the effects of job cuts on the unemployment rate, so that the current measured level of unemployment may understate the extent of job loss or the difficulty of finding new work.",2004-01-04,NO-EFFECT,0.7111836075782776
"Of course, a labor market that is slack and improving only slowly is likely to produce continued slow growth in nominal wages, contributing to continued moderate growth in costs.",2004-01-04,NO-EFFECT,0.9723072648048401
"Why has the labor market remained relatively weak, despite increasingly rapid growth in output?",2004-01-04,NO-EFFECT,0.5396327972412109
"Although many factors have affected the rate of job creation, I concluded in my earlier analysis that the rapid rate of productivity growth, already discussed in relation to unit labor costs, has also been an important reason for the slow pace of recovery in the labor market.",2004-01-04,STABLE,0.6241470575332642
"All else equal, strong productivity gains allow firms to meet a given level of demand with fewer employees.",2004-01-04,STABLE,0.8438332676887512
"Thus, for given growth in aggregate spending, a higher rate of productivity growth implies a slower rate of growth in employment.3 To summarize, then, the current economic situation has three unusual aspects, which together (in my view) rationalize the current stance of monetary policy.",2004-01-04,STABLE,0.850614070892334
"First, inflation is historically low, perhaps at the bottom of the acceptable range, and has recently continued its decline.",2004-01-04,STABLE,0.5707875490188599
"Second, rapid productivity growth has led to actual declines in nominal production costs, which reduce current and future inflationary pressures.",2004-01-04,STABLE,0.8396837711334229
"Finally, the labor market remains soft, reflecting the fact that growth in aggregate demand has been so far insufficient to absorb the increases in aggregate supply afforded by higher productivity.",2004-01-04,NO-EFFECT,0.828145444393158
A soft labor market will keep a lid on the growth in the cost of employing workers.,2004-01-04,NO-EFFECT,0.8141279220581055
"An accommodative monetary policy is needed, in my view, to support the ongoing recovery, particularly in the labor market.",2004-01-04,STABLE,0.5509476065635681
"At the same time, the risks of policy accommodation seem low, as inflation is low and inflation pressures seem quite subdued.",2004-01-04,STABLE,0.6613673567771912

"Achieving price stability in the United States was an historic accomplishment, and preserving that legacy is crucially important.",2004-01-04,STABLE,0.8010193705558777

"Price stability is of utmost importance to the nation's economic health, and I believe that the FOMC will do whatever is necessary to be sure that inflation remains well contained.",2004-01-04,NO-EFFECT,0.7691239714622498
"With that preface, I will address briefly a few concerns of those who worry that inflation is poised to rise, beginning with the recent behavior of commodity prices.",2004-01-04,NO-EFFECT,0.5015363693237305

Do these developments imply a significant increase in inflation risk at the level of the final consumer?,2004-01-04,STABLE,0.5489221215248108
"First, the recent movements in commodity prices are hardly surprising; they are in fact quite normal for this stage of the business cycle.",2004-01-04,STABLE,0.8742956519126892
"The acceleration in the core PPI for crude materials that we have seen is about what should have been expected, given the increases that have occurred recently in both domestic and worldwide economic activity.4 The increase in the demand for commodities from China alone has been substantial; for example, that country's share of world copper consumption is estimated to have risen from less than 5 percent in 1990 to 20 percent in 2003.",2004-01-04,STABLE,0.7955487370491028
"The much more moderate acceleration in intermediate goods prices can likewise be traced to the increase in economic activity, with some additional effect coming from the decline in the dollar and the indirect impact of increases in energy prices.",2004-01-04,STABLE,0.7804474830627441
"Second, the direct effects of commodity price inflation on consumer inflation are empirically minuscule, both because raw materials costs are a small portion of total cost and because part of any increase in the cost of materials tends to be absorbed in the margins of final goods producers and distributors.",2004-01-04,STABLE,0.9127832651138306
"Accelerations in commodity prices comparable to or larger than the most recent one occurred following the 1981-82 and 1990-91 recessions, as well as in 1986-87 and 1999, with no noticeable impact on inflation at the consumer level.5 A reasonable rule of thumb is that a permanent 10 percent increase in raw materials prices will lead to perhaps a 0.7 percent increase in the price of intermediate goods and to less than a 0.1 percent increase in consumer prices.",2004-01-04,STABLE,0.8304811716079712

"February 21, 2020 Financial Markets and Monetary Policy: Is There a Hall of Mirrors Problem?",2020-02-21,STABLE,0.8708215951919556
"Vice Chair Richard H. Clarida At the 2020 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, sponsored by the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, New York, New York Share Thank you to the conference organizers for inviting me here to discuss what former Chair Bernanke has famously referred to as a ""hall of mirrors"" problem: a situation in which a central bank's reaction function and financial market prices interact in economically suboptimal and potentially destabilizing ways.1 In my remarks today, I will lay out the way I think about the interplay between financial markets and monetary policy, with a focus on how I myself seek to integrate noisy but often correlated signals about the economy that I glean from models, surveys, and financial markets.2 Three Observations I begin with three unobjectionable observations.",2020-02-21,STABLE,0.9436403512954712
"First, because of Friedman's long and variable lags, monetary policy should beâ€”and, at the Fed, isâ€”forward looking.",2020-02-21,STABLE,0.9101471900939941
"Policy decisions made today will have no effect on today's inflation or unemployment rates, so good policy needs to assess where the economic fundamentals are going tomorrow to calibrate appropriate policy today.",2020-02-21,STABLE,0.568263053894043
"Thus, central banks and financial markets are looking at the same data on macro fundamentals to make inferences about the future path of the economy, and, of course, any decisions on the policy path made by the central bank will influence asset prices through the discount factor.",2020-02-21,STABLE,0.8002768158912659
So optimal monetary policy will (almost) always be correlated with asset prices.,2020-02-21,STABLE,0.9113977551460266
"Second, because key variables that are crucial inputs for conducting monetary policyâ€”such as r*, u*, and expected inflation, to name just threeâ€”are both unobserved and time varying, responsible monetary policy requires informed views about how these variables evolve over time as well as a humility and an appreciation for the uncertainties surrounding baseline views, however well informed they might be.",2020-02-21,STABLE,0.810297429561615
"Third, when trying to make an inference about unobserved variables like r* or expected inflation, it is generally a good idea to seek data from multiple signals correlated with the variable of interest, so long as the signals themselves are not perfectly correlated with one another.",2020-02-21,STABLE,0.9646722078323364
"Think of this third unobjectionable observation as a sort of ""model averaging"" or ""triangulation"" principle of robust inference in a noisy and complex environment.3 Data Dependence As I have written before, monetary policy needs to beâ€”and, at the Fed, isâ€” ""data dependent"" in two distinct ways.4 Policy should be data dependent in the sense that incoming data indicate the position of the economy relative to the ultimate objectives of price stability and maximum employment.",2020-02-21,STABLE,0.9829892516136169
"This information on where the economy is relative to the goals of monetary policy is an important input into standard interest rate feedback rules, such as those introduced by John Taylor in 1993 and ones that continue today to inform monetary policy decisions at the Fed and at other central banks.5 Monetary policy, however, also needs to be data dependent in the second senseâ€”that incoming data contain signalsâ€”that can enable the central bank to update its estimates of r* and u* in order to obtain its best estimate of the destination to which the economy is heading.",2020-02-21,STABLE,0.8694697618484497
"As I mentioned a moment ago, a challenge for policymakers is that key variables that are essential inputs to monetary policyâ€”such as u*, r*, and expected inflationâ€”cannot be observed directly and must be inferred from observed data.",2020-02-21,STABLE,0.8894699215888977
"And as is indicated in the Summary of Economic Projections, Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants have, over the past seven years, repeatedly revised down their estimates of both u* and r* as unemployment fell and as real interest rates remained well below previous estimates of neutral without the rise in inflation those earlier estimates would have predicted.",2020-02-21,NO-EFFECT,0.8412874341011047
"In addition to u* and r*, an important input into any monetary policy assessment is the state of inflation expectations.",2020-02-21,STABLE,0.895028293132782
"One of the robust messages from the DSGE (dynamic stochastic general equilibrium) literature on optimal monetary policy is that, away from the effective lower bound, optimal monetary policy will not eliminate all inflation volatilityâ€”there are always shocksâ€”but will, under rational expectations (RE), deliver average, and under RE, expected, inflation equal to the target.",2020-02-21,STABLE,0.834973931312561
"Since the late 1990s, inflation expectations appear to have been stable and well anchored in the neighborhood of our 2 percent goal.",2020-02-21,STABLE,0.8731533885002136
"However, like r* and u*, inflation expectations are not directly observable and so must be inferred from data.",2020-02-21,STABLE,0.9273419976234436
Financial Data and Monetary Policy Let me now discuss in more detail how I use a form of model averaging to combine financial market data with data from surveys and econometric models to inform my thinking about the evolution of two key inputs to monetary policy: r* and long-run expected inflation.,2020-02-21,STABLE,0.9634037613868713
"To be sure, financial market signals are noisy, and day-to-day movements in asset prices are unlikely to tell us much about the cyclical or structural position of the economy, let alone r* and expected inflation.",2020-02-21,NO-EFFECT,0.6641749739646912
"Signals derived from financial market data, when combined with signals revealed from surveys of households and firms along with the filtered estimates from econometric models, can together provide valuable and reasonably robust foundations for real-time inference about the direction of travel in r* and expected inflation.",2020-02-21,STABLE,0.9578685164451599
"For example, a ""straight read"" of interest rate futures prices provides one source of high-frequency information about the destination for the federal funds rate expected by market participants.",2020-02-21,STABLE,0.9177886247634888
The destination for the federal funds rate implied by a straight read of futures prices is in turn the sum of the market-implied r* plus market-implied expected inflation.,2020-02-21,STABLE,0.9332910776138306
But these signals from interest rate futures are only a pure measure of the expected policy rate path under the assumption of a zero risk premium.,2020-02-21,STABLE,0.8249139189720154
"For this reason, it is useful to compare policy rate paths derived from market prices with the path obtained from surveys of market participants, which, while subject to measurement error, should not be contaminated with a term premium.",2020-02-21,STABLE,0.9538594484329224
"But when there is a divergence between the path or destination for the policy rate implied by the surveys and a straight read of interest rate derivatives prices, I place at least as much weight on the survey evidenceâ€”for example, derived from the surveys of primary dealers and market participants conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New Yorkâ€”as I do on the estimates obtained from market prices.",2020-02-21,STABLE,0.7056838274002075
"Finally, as another reality check, I, of course, always consult the latest estimate of r* produced by the Laubach and Williams (2003) unobservable components state-space model, which, I should point out, includes no information on asset prices other than the short-term nominal interest rate itself.6 Quotes from the Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) market can provide valuable information about both r* and expected inflation.",2020-02-21,STABLE,0.9511038064956665
"TIPS market data, together with nominal Treasury yields, can be used to construct measures of ""breakeven inflation"" or inflation compensation that provide a noisy signal of market expectations of future inflation.",2020-02-21,STABLE,0.9186630249023438
"But, again, a straight read of breakeven inflation based on TIPS curve forward real rates needs to be augmented with a model to filter out the liquidity and risk premium components that place a wedge between inflation compensation and expected inflation.",2020-02-21,STABLE,0.7813451886177063
"It is again useful to compare estimates of expected inflation derived from breakeven inflation data with estimates of expected inflation obtained from surveysâ€”for example, the expected inflation over the next 5 to 10 years from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers.",2020-02-21,STABLE,0.9781376123428345
"Market- and survey-based estimates of expected inflation are correlated, but, again, when there is a divergence between the two, I place at least as much weight on the survey evidence as on the market-derived estimates.",2020-02-21,STABLE,0.868433952331543
"Again, here I also consult time-series models of underlying inflation, such as Stock and Watson (2007) and Cecchetti and others (2017), presented at the U.S. Monetary Policy Forum in 2017.7 At the Fed, the staff have estimated a state-space model decomposition of the common factor that drives a number of different measures of inflation expectations.",2020-02-21,STABLE,0.9798876047134399
"As I look at all of this evidence from market signals, surveys, and econometric models, I judge that inflation expectations reside at the low end of the range I consider consistent with our price-stability goal of 2 percent personal consumption expenditure inflation in the long run.",2020-02-21,STABLE,0.7509826421737671
"In both of the examples I have just discussed, the medium-frequency evolution of market-based, survey-based, and model-based estimates of r* and expected inflation have, over time, tended to move broadly together.",2020-02-21,STABLE,0.9708729386329651
"When high-frequency market signals diverge from the survey- and model-based estimates, the potential benefit from increasing the weight on a signal derived from a forward-looking asset price versus backward estimates from models and slowly evolving surveys must be balanced against the cost of treating the noise in the asset price as a signal.",2020-02-21,STABLE,0.7022038698196411
"Although I will touch on global imbalances, I would like to focus on globalizationâ€™s potential influence on inflation and the associated implications for monetary policy.",2006-06-16,STABLE,0.907088041305542
"It seems a natural focus for a policymaker at a central bank, and, indeed, several of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) have also addressed this issue in recent months.1 As you would see from reading their remarks, no consensus has yet emerged about how globalization has been influencing recent inflation developments, and part of my intention today is to illustrate some of the considerable challenges that are involved in attempting to identify the extent to which the recent pickup in the pace of global economic integration has influenced inflation dynamics in the United States.2 Of course, the trend toward greater international integration of product and financial markets has been established for quite a while; the share of U.S. economic activity involved in international trade (measured by nominal exports plus imports as a share of nominal gross domestic product) has been rising since the early 1970s.",2006-06-16,STABLE,0.7035546898841858

"These channels include the direct and indirect effects on domestic inflation of lower import prices, a heightened sensitivity of domestic inflation to foreign demand conditions (and perhaps less sensitivity to domestic demand conditions), downward pressure on domestic wage growth, and upward pressure on domestic productivity growth.5 In trying to clarify my own thinking about the likely magnitude of these effects, I find that a useful starting point is a simple reduced-form equation that attempts to explain movements in inflation and then to ask whether and how the statistical relationships embedded in this equation have been affected by globalization.",2006-06-16,NO-EFFECT,0.5117888450622559

"And, finally, we can look for evidence of model errors that would be consistent with the hypothesis that globalization has been restraining inflation.",2006-06-16,STABLE,0.8945783376693726
I will start with the import price channel--the hypothesis that increased globalization has depressed import prices and thus domestic inflation.,2006-06-16,STABLE,0.8823689222335815
"Importantly, the estimated strength of this channel should capture not only the direct effects of import prices on the cost of living in the United States but, also, at least a portion of the indirect effects of actual and potential import competition on the prices of goods produced domestically.",2006-06-16,STABLE,0.8321902751922607
"In the reduced-form model that Iâ€™ve just described, the effects of import prices on inflation show up quite clearly; furthermore, the estimated effects appear to have increased over time, with the increase apparently stemming primarily from the upward trend in the share of imported consumer goods in household spending.6 We can use the model to get a rough idea of how relative changes in import prices have influenced domestic inflation by simulating how core consumer prices would have behaved if relative import prices had instead remained constant.",2006-06-16,STABLE,0.9152424335479736

"According to the model simulation, which also builds in the associated reduction in inflation expectations, the direct and indirect effects of this decline in the relative price of imports held down core inflation by between 1/2 and 1 percentage point per year over this period, an estimated effect that is substantially larger than it would have been in earlier decades.",2006-06-16,STABLE,0.8085570335388184
"However, much of the decline in import prices during this period was probably driven by movements in exchange rates and the effects of technological change on goods prices rather than by the growing integration of world markets.7 In addition, import prices have risen at about the same average pace as core consumer prices over the past several years and thus no longer appear to be acting as a significant restraint on inflation in the United States.",2006-06-16,NO-EFFECT,0.9026457071304321

"In the context of the inflation model, we can examine this issue in two ways.",2006-06-16,STABLE,0.9640926718711853
"First, we can look for evidence that the coefficients on the domestic output or unemployment gaps have fallen over time.",2006-06-16,STABLE,0.9110501408576965

"With regard to the first test, we do find evidence that the coefficient on the unemployment gap has fallen in the United States.",2006-06-16,STABLE,0.8462079167366028
"Of course, globalization is not the only potential explanation for this result, and numerous other researchers have cited persistently low inflation and the improved credibility of monetary policy as having played a more important role.",2006-06-16,STABLE,0.9104257225990295

"Efforts to find such a link have met with mixed results, with some researchers having found large effects and others having found no effect.8 Our own analysis of this issue indicates that these results are sensitive to how the foreign output gap is defined and to how the inflation model is specified, suggesting that any effect may not be especially strong.",2006-06-16,STABLE,0.9565246105194092
One hypothesis is that the increase in the supply of low-skilled workers associated with the emergence of China and other East Asian countries as low-cost centers of production has put downward pressure on the growth of nominal wages in the United States.,2006-06-16,NO-EFFECT,0.5801761746406555
"However, a model of changes in aggregate labor compensation that is similar in structure to the price-inflation model that I described earlier does not detect a stable relationship between measures of globalization (for example, import price changes or the BIS estimates of the foreign output gap) and aggregate wage dynamics in the United States.",2006-06-16,STABLE,0.6597768068313599

"In support of this link, some cross-section studies have found a relationship between industry wage growth and import penetration, while the research on wage inequality tends to relate some of the relative decline in wages of low-skilled workers to trade, although in both types of studies the effects are generally relatively small.9 Similarly, research from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows a modest relationship between exchange rate fluctuations and wage growth, with larger effects evident for the wages of lower-skilled workers.10 A second possibility is that globalization has restrained unit labor costs by raising productivity.",2006-06-16,STABLE,0.9274665713310242
Increasing volumes of trade should bolster productivity as economies concentrate their resources in those sectors in which they are relatively more efficient.,2006-06-16,STABLE,0.8384339809417725

"Nevertheless, research at the Board finds that multinational corporations, which may have the greater opportunities to realize efficiencies by shifting production locations, accounted for a disproportionate share of aggregate productivity growth in the late 1990s.11 And some microeconomic studies have found a relationship between global engagement and productivity at the firm level.12 Thus, it seems possible that the persistently high growth rates of multifactor productivity in recent years may partly be due to the productivity-enhancing effects of globalization.",2006-06-16,STABLE,0.6647031307220459
"In this regard, I would note that a potential shortcoming of my approach to assessing the effects of globalization on inflation is that these effects may be too recent to be captured adequately by the data.",2006-06-16,STABLE,0.8584072589874268

"But, for the most part, the evidence seems to suggest that to date the effects have been gradual and limited: a greater role for the direct and indirect effects of import prices; possibly some damping of unit labor costs, though less so for prices from this channel judging from high profit margins; and potentially a smaller effect of the domestic output gap and a greater effect of foreign output gaps, but here too the evidence is far from conclusive.",2006-06-16,NO-EFFECT,0.6762120127677917

"In 2012, the FOMC formally adopted a longer-run inflation target of 2 percent, and since then, that target has been reaffirmed annually by the Committee including in our new framework adopted in August 2020.5 The key innovations in the new framework relative to the previous incarnation are designed primarily to address the risk that inflation and inflation expectations could settle below our 2 percent target.",2021-10-20,STABLE,0.5672740936279297
That risk emanates from the understanding that several longer-run changes in the U.S. economy may have conspired to reduce the level of the equilibrium federal funds rateâ€”the level at which it is neither slowing nor speeding up economic activity.,2021-10-20,NO-EFFECT,0.9628201127052307

What is the right conceptual framework for thinking about inflation expectations in the current context?,2007-07-10,STABLE,0.9455941915512085
"The traditional rational-expectations model of inflation and inflation expectations has been a useful workhorse for thinking about issues of credibility and institutional design, but, to my mind, it is less helpful for thinking about economies in which (1) the structure of the economy is constantly evolving in ways that are imperfectly understood by both the public and policymakers and (2) the policymakers' objective function is not fully known by private agents.",2007-07-10,STABLE,0.9071444869041443
"In particular, together with the assumption that the central bank's objective function is fixed and known to the public, the traditional rational-expectations approach implies that the public has firm knowledge of the long-run equilibrium inflation rate; consequently, their long-run inflation expectations do not vary over time in response to new information.",2007-07-10,STABLE,0.9123373627662659
"But in fact, as I will discuss in more detail later, long-run inflation expectations do vary over time.",2007-07-10,STABLE,0.9003621935844421

"So, for example, if the public experiences a spell of inflation higher than their long-run expectation, but their long-run expectation of inflation changes little as a result, then inflation expectations are well anchored.",2007-07-10,STABLE,0.7583104968070984
"If, on the other hand, the public reacts to a short period of higher-than-expected inflation by marking up their long-run expectation considerably, then expectations are poorly anchored.",2007-07-10,NO-EFFECT,0.9755921959877014

"In a learning context, the concept of anchored expectations is easily formalized in a variety of ways; in general, if the public is modeled as being confident in its current estimate of the long-run inflation rate, so that new information has relatively little effect on that estimate, then the essential idea of well-anchored expectations has been captured.",2007-07-10,STABLE,0.942154049873352

Implications of Anchored Inflation ExpectationsWhy do we care about the variability of inflation expectations?,2007-07-10,STABLE,0.9399347901344299

"Mishkin illustrated this point by considering the implications of the fact that inflation expectations have become much better anchored over the past thirty years for the estimated coefficients of the conventional Phillips curve, which I define here to encompass specifications that use lagged values of inflation to proxy for expectations or other sources of inflation inertia.",2007-07-10,STABLE,0.9521167278289795
"As he noted, many studies of the conventional Phillips curve find that the sensitivity of inflation to activity indicators is lower today than in the past (that is, the Phillips curve appears to have become flatter);1 and that the long-run effect on inflation of ""supply shocks,"" such as changes in the price of oil, also appears to be lower than in the past (Hooker, 2002).",2007-07-10,STABLE,0.7038165926933289

"Notably, the sharp increases in energy prices over the past few years have not led either to persistent inflation or to a recession, in contrast (for example) to the U.S. experience of the 1970s.",2007-07-10,STABLE,0.8525261878967285
"Various factors might account for these changes in the Phillips curve, but, as Mishkin pointed out, better-anchored inflation expectations--themselves, of course, the product of monetary policies that brought inflation down and have kept it relatively stable--certainly play some role.",2007-07-10,STABLE,0.8453461527824402
"If people set prices and wages with reference to the rate of inflation they expect in the long run and if inflation expectations respond less than previously to variations in economic activity, then inflation itself will become relatively more insensitive to the level of activity--that is, the conventional Phillips curve will be flatter.",2007-07-10,NO-EFFECT,0.9717128872871399

"A related implication is that, if inflation expectations are well anchored, changes in energy (and food) prices should have relatively little influence on ""core"" inflation, that is, inflation excluding the prices of food and energy.",2007-07-10,STABLE,0.75739586353302

"Models of the term structure of interest rates better fit the data under the assumption that both inflation expectations and beliefs about the central bank's reaction function are evolving (Kozicki and Tinsley, 2001; Rudebusch and Wu, 2003; Cogley, 2005).",2007-07-10,STABLE,0.9267596006393433

"Stock and Watson model inflation as having two components, which may be interpreted as the trend and the cycle.",2007-07-10,STABLE,0.922321617603302
Changes in the trend component are highly persistent whereas shocks to the cyclical component are temporary.2 The key finding of this research is that the variability of the trend component of inflation (and thus the share of the overall variability of inflation that it can explain) appears to have fallen significantly after about 1983.,2007-07-10,STABLE,0.8576547503471375
"That is, unexpected changes in inflation are today much more likely to be transitory than they were before the early 1980s.",2007-07-10,STABLE,0.8569421768188477
"Because it seems quite unlikely that changes in inflation could persist indefinitely unless long-run expectations of inflation also changed, I interpret the Stock-Watson finding as consistent with the view that inflation expectations have become much more anchored since the early 1980s.",2007-07-10,STABLE,0.5909242033958435
"At the same time, that the variability of the trend component of inflation, though modest, remains positive, implies that long-run expectations of inflation are not perfectly anchored today.",2007-07-10,NO-EFFECT,0.9766631722450256

Clarida At the Symposium on Monetary Policy Frameworks, The Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share Watch Live Outlooks and Outcomes for the U.S. Economy The U.S. economy in the second quarter of this year made the transition from economic recovery to economic expansion.1 Given the catastrophic collapse in U.S. economic activity in the first half of 2020 as a result of the global pandemic and the mitigation efforts put in place to contain it, few forecasters could have expectedâ€”or even dared to hopeâ€”in the spring of last year that the recovery in gross domestic product (GDP), from the sharpest decline in activity since the Great Depression, would be either so robust or as rapid.",2021-11-08,STABLE,0.9745231866836548
"Indeed, the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating Committee determined in July that the recession that began in March of last year ended in April, making it not only the deepest recession on record, but also the briefest.2 The recovery that commenced in the summer of 2020 was quite robust, and, with one quarter to go, GDP growth in 2021 is projected by the Fed and many outside forecasters to be the fastest since 1983.",2021-11-08,STABLE,0.8479795455932617
"That said, under the median projection for GDP growth in the September Summary of Economic projections, the level of real GDP will have returned to its pre pandemic trend growth trajectory by the fourth quarter of 2021, which if realized would represent one of the most rapid such recoveries in 50 years.3 In the September SEP round, my individual projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, inflation, and the policy rate path turned out to be quite close to the path of SEP medians for each of these variables over the 2021â€“24 projection window.",2021-11-08,STABLE,0.5910903811454773

"Not surprisingly, the projected path of above-trend GDP growth in 2021 and 2022 translates into rapid declines in the projected path for the unemployment rate, which is projected to fall to 3.8 percent by the end of 2022 and 3.5 percent by the end of 2023.",2021-11-08,NO-EFFECT,0.9698189496994019
"This modal projection for the path of the unemployment rate is, according to the Atlanta Fed jobs calculator, consistent with a rebound in labor force participation to its estimated demographic trend and is also consistent with cumulative employment gains this year and next that, by the end of 2022, eliminate the 4.2 million ""employment gap"" relative to the previous cycle peak.4 My projections for headline and core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation are, alas, also similar to the median SEP numbers.",2021-11-08,STABLE,0.38244959712028503

"Although in a number of sectors of the economy the imbalances between demand and supplyâ€”including labor supplyâ€”are substantial, I do continue to judge that these imbalances are likely to dissipate over time as the labor market and global supply chains eventually adjust and, importantly, do so without putting persistent upward pressure on price inflation and wage gains adjusted for productivity.",2021-11-08,VOLATILE,0.8494247794151306

"Prospects for U.S. Monetary Policy In September 2020, the FOMC introducedâ€”and since then has reaffirmedâ€”outcome-based, threshold guidance that specifies three conditions that the Committee expects will be met before it considers increasing the target range for the federal funds rate, currently 0 to 25 basis points.5 This guidance in September of last year brought the forward guidance on the federal funds rate in the statement into alignment with the new flexible average inflation targeting framework adopted in August 2020.6 To quote from the statement, these conditions are that ""labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.""",2021-11-08,STABLE,0.4872056245803833
"While we are clearly a ways away from considering raising interest rates, if the outlooks for inflation and unemployment I summarized a moment ago turn out to be the actual outcomes realized over the forecast horizon, then I believe that these three necessary conditions for raising the target range for the federal funds rate will have been met by year-end 2022.7 Core PCE inflation since February 2020â€”a calculation window that smooths out any base effects resulting from ""round trip"" declines and rebounds in the price levels of COVID-19-sensitive sectors and, coincidentally, also measures the average rate of core PCE inflation since hitting the effective lower bound (ELB) in March 2020â€”is running at 2.8 percent through September 2021 and is projected to remain moderately above 2 percent in all three years of the projection window.",2021-11-08,NO-EFFECT,0.9577450156211853
"Moreover, my inflation projections for 2023 and 2024, which forecast inflation rates similar to the SEP medians, would by year-end 2022, to me, satisfy the ""on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time"" threshold specified in the statement.",2021-11-08,NO-EFFECT,0.8282616138458252
"Finally, while my assessment of maximum employment incorporates a wide range of indicators to assess the state of the labor marketâ€”including indicators of labor compensation, productivity, and price-cost markupsâ€”the employment data I look at, such as the Kansas City Fed's Labor Market Conditions Indicators, are historically highly correlated with the unemployment rate.8 My expectation today is that the labor market by the end of 2022 will have reached my assessment of maximum employment if the unemployment rate has declined by then to the SEP median of modal projections of 3.8 percent.",2021-11-08,NO-EFFECT,0.811523973941803
"Given this economic outlook and so long as inflation expectations remain well anchored at the 2 percent longer-run goalâ€”which, based on the Fed staff's common inflation expectations (CIE) index, I judge at present to be the caseâ€”a policy normalization path similar to the median SEP dot plot on page 4 of our September 2021 projections would, under these conditions, be entirely consistent, to me, with our new flexible average inflation targeting framework and the policy rate reaction function I discussed in remarks here at Brookings in November 2020.9 In the context of our new framework, it is important to note that while the ELB can be a constraint on monetary policy, the ELB is not a constraint on fiscal policy, and appropriate monetary policy under our new framework, to me, mustâ€”and certainly canâ€”incorporate this reality.",2021-11-08,VOLATILE,0.6077910661697388
"Indeed, under present circumstances, I judge that the support to aggregate demand from fiscal policyâ€”including the roughly $2 trillion in accumulated excess savings accruing from (as yet) unspent transfer paymentsâ€”in tandem with appropriate monetary policy, can fully offset the constraint, highlighted in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, that the ELB imposes on the ability of inflation-targeting monetary policy, acting on its own and in the absence of sufficient fiscal support, to restore, following a recession, maximum employment and price stability while keeping inflation expectations well anchored at the 2 percent longer-run goal.10 Before I conclude, let me say a few words about our Treasury and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) purchase programs.",2021-11-08,NO-EFFECT,0.6217487454414368

These estimates suggest that actual output is above potential (the unemployment rate is below the NAIRU) and that actual output growth has been above trend growth of potential.,2000-01-20,STABLE,0.7171275019645691
"Despite the uncertainties, the consensus estimates of the NAIRU and the growth of potential give us a hint about what type of landing we should be aiming for and which of the scenarios depicted in figure 1 best describe the economy's initial conditions and prospects.",2000-01-20,NO-EFFECT,0.7439541816711426
"That is, even after we incorporate the estimated decline in the NAIRU and the higher rate of growth of potential (as reflected in figure 1.C), output is above potential and output growth exceeds that of potential (as depicted in figures 1.B and 1.D).",2000-01-20,STABLE,0.7496230006217957
"To complete the picture, we also have to rely on the temporary disinflationary effects of favorable relative-price shocks and the increase in the productivity trend that have allowed the economy to operate, for a while, beyond potential without suffering inflationary consequences.",2000-01-20,NO-EFFECT,0.4819263815879822
"Hard Landings Associated with the Unwinding of Sector and Market Imbalances Much of the recent concern about the sustainability of this expansion is, nevertheless, not related directly to the balance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply.",2000-01-20,NO-EFFECT,0.9061216711997986
"Most notably, attention has focused on equity prices, the personal saving rate, the current account deficit, and debt burdens.",2000-01-20,STABLE,0.7185165286064148

"The chart for the stock market, figure 2.A, shows the price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P500 index, based on the trailing four-quarter earnings.",2000-01-20,STABLE,0.870971143245697
Common Sources of Recent Developments What I do want to focus on this afternoon are possible common sources for the developments pictured in figure 2 and the relation of any imbalance between aggregate supply and demand to those developments.,2000-01-20,STABLE,0.9544824957847595
"During expansions, equity prices tend to rise, although they often decline before a downturn in the economy.",2000-01-20,STABLE,0.6995054483413696
"The unemployment rate, for example, has declined to a 30-year low.",2000-01-20,STABLE,0.8958500027656555
"Private domestic demand typically is the driver of expansions, but its contribution has been even greater than usual this time.",2000-01-20,STABLE,0.6030712723731995
"The direct contribution of federal government spending and tax changes, reflected in the swing in the federal budget from deficit to surplus, has been a net drag on growth.",2000-01-20,STABLE,0.7212537527084351
So the pace of domestic private demand has been even stronger than the growth in overall output.,2000-01-20,STABLE,0.8032073974609375
"Private domestic spending has been driven, in part, by the wealth effect arising from higher equity prices, a situation that also helps to explain much of the decline in the personal saving rate, and has been financed by a higher household debt and by the tapping of foreign saving.",2000-01-20,NO-EFFECT,0.5009621381759644
Also the two types of imbalances--an imbalance between aggregate demand and aggregate supply and sector or market imbalances--could be connected.,2000-01-20,STABLE,0.8664025068283081
Consider a situation in which growth is above trend and output moves beyond capacity.,2000-01-20,STABLE,0.6689164638519287
"If investors misread these developments as sustainable and, therefore, extrapolate the exceptional conditions, exceptional and perhaps unsustainable movements in equity prices, the saving rate, and debt burden might be encouraged.",2000-01-20,NO-EFFECT,0.9962284564971924
"Alternatively, a rise in equity prices that outstrips fundamentals might contribute to a pace of private domestic demand that ultimately takes output beyond capacity; in this case, the market or sector imbalance would be what contributed to the aggregate demand-supply imbalance.",2000-01-20,NO-EFFECT,0.9805708527565002
"Finally, market or sector imbalances could possibly rise to worrisome proportions in the absence of an imbalance between aggregate demand and supply.",2000-01-20,NO-EFFECT,0.9716981649398804
This analysis leaves us with four possible combinations: (1) simultaneous imbalances in both aggregate demand/supply and market/sector variables; (2) simultaneous balance in each class; (3) aggregate demand/supply imbalance accompanied by balance in market/sector variables; and (4) aggregate demand/supply balance accompanied by market/sector imbalances.,2000-01-20,STABLE,0.911843478679657
"A decline in the stock market might also, for example, reduce confidence in the U.S. economy and reduce the willingness of foreigners to accumulate the increment in U.S. liabilities associated with the current account deficit.",2000-01-20,NO-EFFECT,0.9514971375465393
"As a result of these considerations, simple multiplier exercises, such as the effect on the economy of a given percentage decline in equity prices, probably tell more about the econometric model used than about prospects for the economy.",2000-01-20,STABLE,0.9083776473999023
"The Challenge for Monetary Policy The most important of the perceived imbalances I have discussed today is, in my view, the possibility of an overheated economy.",2000-01-20,NO-EFFECT,0.5510013699531555
"In three of the four combinations of aggregate demand/supply and market/sector imbalances, it seems to me that the best approach would be to focus directly on the aggregate demand/supply imbalance and allow the indirect effects of such a policy to mitigate any other imbalances.",2000-01-20,STABLE,0.8813477754592896
"In addition, any other imbalances are more likely to grow to worrisome proportions during an unsustainable boom and are more likely to unwind in a disruptive manner if confronted by rising inflation, sharply higher interest rates in response to higher inflation, and a subsequent recession.",2000-01-20,NO-EFFECT,0.9914867877960205
That leaves the possibility that there might be cases when we face market/sector imbalances in the absence of any aggregate demand/supply imbalance.,2000-01-20,NO-EFFECT,0.9480770826339722
"In such a case, the level and growth of output are sustainable in the sense that they are not putting pressure on inflation; but this aggregate balance might be threatened subsequently by a spontaneous unwinding of a market/sector imbalance.",2000-01-20,NO-EFFECT,0.989639163017273
What role can and should monetary policy play in such a case?,2000-01-20,STABLE,0.8742470741271973
"Furthermore, it is not obvious how to unwind an excessive debt burden, to raise the personal saving rate, or to narrow the current account deficit in a sustainable way through monetary policy.",2000-01-20,NO-EFFECT,0.853795051574707
"As a result, monetary policy, in my view, needs to focus on achieving balance between aggregate supply and aggregate demand.",2000-01-20,STABLE,0.705509603023529
"In pursuing this course, monetary policy is confronted by two competing challenges.",2000-01-20,STABLE,0.5540623664855957
The first is to allow the economy to realize the benefits of any decline in the NAIRU and any increase in trend growth.,2000-01-20,STABLE,0.6672573089599609
Supporting maximum sustainable growth is very much the business of monetary policy.,2000-01-20,STABLE,0.8415729403495789
But achieving maximum sustainable growth also is about ensuring the sustainability of an expansion and hence avoiding overheating.,2000-01-20,NO-EFFECT,0.543016791343689
"I focus on the change in the consensus forecast because, in my judgment, it is the revision in the outlook for 1999 in response to recent developments in the global economy and domestic financial markets that justified the recent easing of monetary policy.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.8727521896362305
Then I will conclude with a discussion of the implications of the outlook for monetary policy.,1998-10-05,STABLE,0.9023051261901855
"The key here is to explain the rapid change in the posture of monetary policy--from a stance of asymmetric toward tightening just a few months ago, to symmetric, and then to an easing.",1998-10-05,STABLE,0.8306260704994202
Let me emphasize that the views on the economic outlook and monetary policy I present this morning are my own.,1998-10-05,STABLE,0.9082735180854797
"The bottom line is that you forecast a benign slowdown that unwinds some of the tightness in labor markets, while sustaining growth and maintaining modest inflation.",1998-10-05,STABLE,0.6017776727676392
Your forecast also presumes a flexible monetary policy that responds to changing conditions and effectively promotes such an outcome.,1998-10-05,STABLE,0.8636659979820251
"Judging from the path of the Treasury bill rate, the Blue Chip forecast assumed no change in monetary policy through 1999.",1998-10-05,STABLE,0.9286145567893982
"So, the NABE forecast was slightly weaker, but just offset by its assumption of a policy easing, leaving the forecasts for growth over 1999 identical in both cases.",1998-10-05,STABLE,0.7589744925498962
"More likely, it reflects the fact that during this period, there have also been continuing upside surprises with respect to domestic demand.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.7744824886322021
"As a result, the upward revisions to the forecast for domestic demand may have just offset downward revisions to the forecast for net exports.",1998-10-05,STABLE,0.8026890754699707
"More recently, it also appears to reflect your confidence in monetary policy, a theme that I will return to later.",1998-10-05,STABLE,0.8613570332527161
A soft landing is achieved if growth slows to trend just as the economy converges to potential output.,1998-10-05,STABLE,0.5761247277259827
"In this case, growth has to slow to a below-trend rate until actual output again converges to potential, at which point growth returns to and remains at trend.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9638442397117615
"The characterization of the forecast as a reverse soft landing hinges on the interpretation that the unemployment rate is initially below NAIRU and that growth slows below trend going forward, allowing the transition back toward NAIRU.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.95863276720047
"While this is consistent with your estimates of NAIRU and trend growth, I was, nevertheless, surprised that your estimate of NAURU was as low as it was, 4.9%, and that your estimate of trend growth, 2.7%, was as high as it was.",1998-10-05,STABLE,0.8174970149993896
The qualitative features of the reverse soft landing scenario in your forecast are slowing growth and rising inflation.,1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.6318758130073547
"There is a hint of stagflation in your forecast--below-trend growth and rising unemployment, on the one hand, and rising inflation on the other.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.7556551694869995
"It reflects, I expect, on the inflation side, both the contribution of demand pressures in the labor market, as a consequence of the initial conditions, and dissipation or even reversal of the favorable supply shocks that have been restraining inflation.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9717692136764526
"A version that had slower growth and a sharper rise in the unemployment rate, but still well short of a recession, could be consistent, for example, with stable inflation, even beginning from initial conditions of very tight labor markets.",1998-10-05,STABLE,0.45775121450424194
I focus here on the contributions from net exports and private domestic demand.,1998-10-05,STABLE,0.9054615497589111
An external shock lowers net exports and slows GDP growth; the resulting slowdown in GDP growth then weakens domestic demand.,1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.6016665101051331
"Even though the decline in net exports was much sharper than virtually anyone expected, subtracting more than 2 percentage points from growth, the economy's average growth did not differ much from the pace over the previous year.",1998-10-05,STABLE,0.7675598859786987
"The growth in the first half was, to be sure, unbalanced between the first and second quarters, but that was entirely due to the rise in inventory investment in the first quarter and its decline in the second.",1998-10-05,STABLE,0.8455378413200378
The strength of domestic demand and the subtraction via net exports were very similar in both quarters.,1998-10-05,STABLE,0.8921089172363281
The explanation for the stability of GDP growth was the surprising surge of private domestic demand that offset the sharper-than-expected decline in net exports.,1998-10-05,STABLE,0.8354520797729492
"Private domestic demand soared to an 8% annual rate in the first half, from the robust 4 ½% rate over the previous two years.",1998-10-05,STABLE,0.6453436613082886
This raises two questions: Why did private demand soar in the first half and why will the economy slow going forward?,1998-10-05,STABLE,0.743095338344574
"To be sure, recent developments have reinforced the negative outlook for the external sector and net exports will be subtracting from GDP growth going forward.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9861555695533752
"But in the consensus forecast, net exports subtract less than half as much from GDP growth in the second half as in the first half and still less in 1999.",1998-10-05,STABLE,0.7707087397575378
"Hence, the slowdown scenario now depends critically on a slowing in domestic demand.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.8792399168014526
"So while all eyes are focused on global turmoil and the spillover to U.S. net exports, I believe that you are correct to focus the case for slowdown ahead on diminished strength in private domestic demand.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9909363389015198
"There are three key developments that, in my view, justify a downward revision for the forecast for growth in 1999.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9131967425346375
"First, the further pressure on emerging market economies, especially Latin America, following the Russian default and devaluation merits a downward revision in the forecast for foreign growth and hence in U.S. net exports.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.988381564617157
"Second, the correction in equity prices points to a downward revision to consumer spending and to business fixed investment and residential construction as well.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9872162938117981
Phase one resulted in a powerful adverse shock to U.S. aggregate demand as a result of the decline in net exports induced by the combination of recessions and sharp depreciations in the region.,1998-10-05,STABLE,0.5159671902656555
"But the same global turmoil that undermined net exports also brought a shift in portfolio preferences toward dollar-denominated assets, resulting in lower interest rates and perhaps adding to the resilience of U.S. equity markets.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.8237131834030151
"In addition, an important part of the decline in oil prices could be directly attributable to the regional turmoil, taking into account both the declines in income and the dramatic increase in the relative price of oil, priced in dollars, to this region.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9529125094413757
"The latter two developments buoyed U.S. private domestic demand, contributing at least in part to its strengthening during the first half and partially offsetting the restraint via net exports.",1998-10-05,STABLE,0.7657150030136108
"There has been a sharp correction of equity prices, in the United States and around the world, and rising risk spreads offset and, for the riskier borrowers, more than offset the effect of further declines in government bond rates.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9769401550292969
So phase two has added to the projected decline in net exports ahead and broadened the impact of global turmoil on domestic demand by undermining the favorable set of financial conditions that had been so important in promoting strong growth over the last couple of years.,1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9942573308944702
"Phase one failed to slow GDP growth, in part, because of offsets via lower interest rates and a lower price of oil.",1998-10-05,STABLE,0.8043506145477295
"They do not, I believe, fully explain the surge in domestic demand in the first half.",1998-10-05,STABLE,0.8107000589370728
Part of this surge may have reflected the lagged effects of the long period of rising equity prices and declining long-term rates.,1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.5738293528556824
But part may simply have been an unexplained and fortuitous positive demand surprise.,1998-10-05,STABLE,0.7586832046508789
"In this case, the slowdown going forward will be reinforced to the extent these positive demand shocks dissipate.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9823032021522522
"Growth is going to slow, in part, because it was unexplainably high in the first half.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.5298217535018921
It reminds me of the explanation of our forecast at LHM&A for a sharp decline in long-term interest rates in 1993.,1998-10-05,STABLE,0.8929952383041382
"The slowdown in 1999 will be the cumulative effect of this spontaneous slowing as the high-flying economy succumbs to the force of gravity and the induced slowing of the economy in response to weaker foreign growth, the recent decline in equity values, and the widening of risk spreads and generally reduced appetite for risk.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9939512014389038
A source of such discontinuity arises from possible devaluations in countries on a fixed or pegged exchange rate.,1998-10-05,STABLE,0.5276222825050354
"Whereas under floating rates, a gradual depreciation could take some pressure off an economy subject to an adverse shock, a forced devaluation in a country that can no longer defend its peg often reinforces rather than cushions the downward momentum in the economy in response to an adverse shock and can, therefore, be instrumental in abruptly moving an economy from slow growth to sharp recession.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9825730323791504
"They can be aggressive with the central tendency forecast and project a substantial slowing in growth, leaving us with about equal probabilities that growth will be faster or slower than the central tendency.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9104952216148376
"Both the central tendency and the perception of the probability distribution around that central tendency are important features of the ""outlook"" and are relevant to the setting of monetary policy.",1998-10-05,STABLE,0.9510914087295532
"Interestingly, as I have noted before, this is not a period over which there has been a slowdown in GDP growth.",1998-10-05,STABLE,0.8781490921974182
The margin squeeze reflects the effect of tight labor markets on wages and the deceleration in product prices over the last several quarters.,1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.8882589936256409
One of the most dramatic developments over the last year has been a halving in the inflation rate for broad indices of domestically produced goods.,1998-10-05,STABLE,0.8058578372001648
"For example, the chain price measure for GDP has slowed from 2% over the four quarters ended in the second quarter of 1997 to just 1% over the four quarters ended in the second quarter of 1998.",1998-10-05,STABLE,0.8589842319488525
A couple of tenths of this slowdown can be attributed to developments in food and especially energy prices.,1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.7403383851051331
"A key factor, I believe, was the increasingly rapid decline in import prices.",1998-10-05,STABLE,0.6114219427108765
"Nevertheless, I believe that the effect of declining import prices might have been as large or even larger on the GDP price measure than on the CPI or PCE price indices that directly include imports.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.5848273038864136
One of the most important sources of restraint on inflation in this episode has been the effect of declining import prices on the pricing leverage of domestic producers of competing goods.,1998-10-05,STABLE,0.47715210914611816
"Given the tightness of labor markets, it has been widely expected that profit margins would narrow as the mark-up of prices over unit labor costs declined.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.8864438533782959
This was expected to result from a gradual acceleration of wages relative to prices and to be a precursor of higher price inflation.,1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9122923016548157
"The mark-up has indeed declined, but more from a deceleration of prices relative to wages.",1998-10-05,STABLE,0.6030603051185608
"Instead of pointing toward higher inflation, the decline in the mark-up is in fact further evidence of forces restraining inflation.",1998-10-05,STABLE,0.6292482614517212
"Going forward, slower growth is likely to bring a cyclical slowing in productivity, reinforcing the effect of narrower margins on profits.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9886208176612854
The Challenge Facing Monetary Policy Now I turn to the implications of the outlook for monetary policy.,1998-10-05,STABLE,0.7959865927696228
Two-sided risks The first challenge facing monetary policy is the degree of two-sided risk the economy faces.,1998-10-05,STABLE,0.803377628326416
"The upside risk, the threat of higher inflation, arises from the initial conditions and from the history of growth exceeding expectations over the past two years.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9723550081253052
"This set of initial conditions is clearly not one that supports, much less compels an easing in monetary policy.",1998-10-05,STABLE,0.7555729150772095
"The downside risk became noteworthy following the crises among Asian developing economies and Japan slipping from stagnation into recession and, more recently was exacerbated by the further contagion among emerging market economies, and the decline in equity prices and increased risk spreads here at home.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9943249821662903
"By late September, this balance had shifted enough, in my view, to justify an easing of monetary policy.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.8159945011138916
"Asymmetric risk and the ""maximin"" solution The adjustment to the outlook that justified the policy change can be thought of as some combination of a lower central tendency for growth next year and a widening of the risk associated with downside possibilities relative to the baseline forecast.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9340793490409851
"For example, if there is no change in policy, the worse case outcome would be a sharp slowing in growth to well below the trend rate.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9727163910865784
"Under an easing, the worse case outcome would be that the economy turned out stronger than expected, so the easing was unwarranted, and inflation increased more sharply than projected.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.910068690776825
"My judgment is that the most worrisome possibility has become the former, justifying the easing of monetary policy last week.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9012644290924072
"During the period when the stance of monetary policy was asymmetric toward tightening, the focus was on whether or not a preemptive move toward restraint was justified in light of the progressive tightening of the labor market.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9005699157714844
"Because inflation continued to decline, even as labor markets became tighter, and because the turmoil in global markets held the possibility of some relief in U.S. labor markets, policy remained on hold, with the exception of the single 25-basis point tightening in March of 1997.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.5112953186035156
"If labor markets initially are very tight, growth has been above trend, and there have been consistent surprises on the up side, there will be more caution in easing than if the economy were initially operating just at full employment and growing at trend.",1998-10-05,NO-EFFECT,0.9875160455703735
The Taylor Rule and balancing stabilization and inflation objectives I have talked on several occasions about the usefulness of the Taylor Rule as a starting point for thinking about monetary policy.,1998-10-05,STABLE,0.9424817562103271
"The Taylor Rule specifies how the federal funds rate should be adjusted over time in response to changing economic conditions, allowing attention to be paid to monetary policy's stabilization role in the context of the Federal Reserve's long-run price stability objective.",1998-10-05,STABLE,0.9194501638412476

Conclusion The U.S. economy continues to operate at high utilization rates and with low inflation.,1998-10-05,STABLE,0.8443437814712524

"Indeed, to give the public more information regarding its plan for conducting monetary policy in accordance with its congressional mandate, the Federal Reserve on November 14 announced several important enhancements to its communication strategy.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.9388955235481262
"Here is a brief overview of the main elements of the enhanced communication strategy: FOMC participants now provide projections for four key macroeconomic variables that together reflect our dual mandate of promoting price stability and maximum sustainable employment: the growth of real gross domestic product (GDP); the unemployment rate; overall consumer inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE); and core consumer inflation, which excludes food and energy prices.2 As I discussed in a recent speech, both inflation measures are important: Core inflation is a useful indicator of the underlying near-term trend of inflation, and overall inflation is what households and businesses ultimately care about (Mishkin, 2007c).",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.9389894604682922
"Therefore, a significant aspect of the enhanced communication strategy is that the FOMC has added the overall inflation rate to its announced projections.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.5277470350265503
"The quantitative projections indicate participants' assessments of the most likely (that is, modal) outcomes for economic activity and inflation.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.9463352560997009
"In particular, each participant makes an independent projection based on his or her own assessment of the ""appropriate"" path of monetary policy; that is, the path seen as most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that are consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.9545124769210815
"In the remainder of this speech, I will discuss how the modern science of monetary policy provides a strong rationale for the Federal Reserve's new communication policy, and then I'll describe how a number of key principles of monetary policy making are evident in the latest set of FOMC projections, which were released last week.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.959641695022583
The Rationale for the Federal Reserve's Enhanced Communication StrategyThe modern approach to the formulation of monetary policy is generally characterized by an optimization problem in which policymakers maximize a specific objective function subject to a set of constraints.,2007-11-29,STABLE,0.9795882701873779
"In contrast, expectations about future monetary policy and economic conditions play a key role in economic agents' decisions and thus are important in both the objective function and the constraints of the optimal monetary policy problem.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.9720865488052368
This role of expectations is crucial in understanding why central bank communication is so important for achieving good macroeconomic outcomes.3 Objective Function The modern science of monetary policy proceeds under the assumption that the central bank's purpose is to maximize the well-being of households in the economy; the objective function specifies exactly what should be maximized.,2007-11-29,STABLE,0.9870678782463074
"Broadly speaking, the objective function has two components, each expressed as a deviation from a goal and each with a negative sign: one component is the deviation of inflation from its optimal level, and the other is the deviation of output (or employment) from its so-called natural level, the level that would be attained if prices and wages were completely flexible.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.9112553000450134
"Those components of the objective function capture the essence of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate to promote price stability and maximum employment, a mandate established by the Congress for the ultimate good of the public.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.939354419708252
"Constraints In a market-oriented economy like ours, the science of monetary policy explicitly reflects the extent to which households and firms have the freedom to make their own economic decisions.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.9591377377510071
The overall level of expenditures in the economy--which macroeconomists refer to as aggregate demand--is the sum of all the spending decisions of individual households and firms.,2007-11-29,STABLE,0.9422767162322998
"Aggregate demand exhibits a strong forward-looking component because, as noted, the spending decisions of households include their expectations regarding the future path of the economy.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.6928510069847107
"Similarly, the overall inflation rate of the economy ultimately reflects the price-setting decisions of individual firms, and expectations have a crucial influence on those decisions as well.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.9128954410552979
"However, both aggregate supply and aggregate demand tend to exhibit a substantial degree of inertia, which reflects the significant costs incurred by households and firms in making sudden large adjustments in their consumption, staffing levels, and so forth.",2007-11-29,NO-EFFECT,0.8101439476013184
"Largely because of those inertial elements, monetary policy actions have little or no instantaneous effect on the economy; in fact, the peak effect on aggregate demand may not appear for at least a year, and the peak effect on inflation is subject to even longer lags.",2007-11-29,NO-EFFECT,0.4984667897224426
"Therefore, because the variables the central bank wants to influence have a forward-looking component, and because the effects of policy actions are unlikely to appear for at least a year, macroeconomic projections should have a central role in the monetary policy plan and should appear in the public description of that plan.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.8172099590301514
Broadening the scope of communication by including a description of policymakers' expectations helps households and businesses to make more-informed decisions and can help anchor the private sector's inflation expectations more firmly by clarifying and underscoring the central bank's intention to keep inflation low and stable over the long run.,2007-11-29,STABLE,0.767270565032959
"In all of these ways, central-bank communication that more fully portrays policy considerations facilitates the effectiveness of monetary policy and contributes to the overall stability and growth of the economy.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.9306304454803467
The Science of Monetary Policy and the Longer-Term OutlookI would now like to consider the important information conveyed about the FOMC's longer-term policy strategy in the Federal Reserve's newly released set of macroeconomic projections.,2007-11-29,STABLE,0.9693140983581543
"In that context, I will also highlight how our longer-term strategy fulfills the dual mandate and embeds some of the key implications of the modern science of monetary policy.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.9194988012313843
The Longer-Term Projections for Inflation The projections for both overall and core inflation at the three-year horizon (which is currently 2010) fall in the range of 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent; the central tendency of these projections is 1.6 percent to 1.9 percent.,2007-11-29,STABLE,0.8951242566108704
"As I noted earlier, each FOMC participant's projection is made under the assumption of ""appropriate"" monetary policy--that is, the path of policy calibrated to achieve outcomes for economic activity and inflation that are most consistent with our dual objectives of price stability and maximum employment.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.9358108043670654
"For that reason, the longer-run inflation projections provide information about each FOMC participant's assessment of the inflation rate that best promotes those dual objectives--a rate that I will refer to as the ""mandate-consistent inflation rate.""",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.9576001763343811
"When the underlying level of inflation is reasonably close to its mandate-consistent rate, monetary policy should be able to achieve that rate of inflation in coming years while keeping economic activity near its maximum sustainable level.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.6373153328895569
"Although overall inflation is currently above the mandate-consistent rate, reflecting the effects of energy price increases, core inflation has been well-behaved.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.7081320285797119
"Thus, I believe this description essentially characterizes the current macroeconomic environment, and my own projection of inflation at a three-year horizon is equal to my assessment of the mandate-consistent inflation rate.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.932500958442688
"The range of projections for inflation in 2010--1.5 percent to 2.0 percent--is consistent with a fundamental implication of the modern science of monetary policy--namely, that the well-being of the economy is maximized by maintaining a low and stable inflation rate over time.4 Low inflation promotes social welfare by simplifying the savings and retirement planning of individual households and by facilitating firms' production and investment decisions, all of which helps promote higher productivity growth.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.7173315286636353
"Furthermore, an environment of overall price stability contributes to economic efficiency by reducing the variability of relative prices and by minimizing the distortions that arise because the tax system is not completely indexed to inflation.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.6042187809944153
"Finally, and importantly, low and stable inflation promotes equity and reduces poverty, as the poorest members of society typically do not have access to the sorts of financial instruments that would help protect them against inflation.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.8805769681930542
"At the same time, recent research on the science of monetary policy (as well as the analysis of several historical episodes) has underscored the pitfalls that can result from maintaining a zero or negative inflation rate over time.",2007-11-29,NO-EFFECT,0.5553603768348694
"First, such a strategy tends to raise the likelihood of episodes in which short-term nominal interest rates reach the zero lower bound and thereby hinder the conduct of monetary policy.",2007-11-29,NO-EFFECT,0.9742476344108582
"Second, an economy with a zero average inflation rate will almost inevitably experience some episodes of deflation, which may adversely affect financial markets and thereby hamper the performance of the macroeconomy.",2007-11-29,NO-EFFECT,0.9793620109558105
"Third, if inflation is at or below zero, downward rigidities in nominal wage adjustment might induce some distortions in labor market efficiency, with unfavorable consequences for the level of employment.",2007-11-29,NO-EFFECT,0.9795506000518799
"In light of these considerations, as Chairman Bernanke (2007) recently noted, ""the (properly measured) long-run inflation rate that best promotes the dual mandate is likely to be low but not zero.""",2007-11-29,NO-EFFECT,0.6010463237762451
"The science of monetary policy has also emphasized the importance of establishing the central bank's strong and credible commitment to keeping inflation low and stable over the long run because that commitment helps to stabilize inflation expectations; in turn, stable expectations aid the functioning of the economy and the efficacy of policy.",2007-11-29,VOLATILE,0.6219061613082886
"The increased information that these projections convey regarding FOMC participants' views of the mandate-consistent inflation rate, combined with the FOMC's continuing commitment to keeping inflation low and stable, should help anchor inflation expectations even more firmly.",2007-11-29,VOLATILE,0.7684841752052307
Better information on FOMC participants' views on the mandate-consistent inflation rate is also essential for achieving the other element of the dual mandate--maximum employment.,2007-11-29,STABLE,0.7442808151245117
"By increasing the likelihood of achieving a low and predictable inflation rate, providing information on the mandate-consistent inflation rate plays a crucial role in facilitating long-term growth in employment and labor productivity.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.8579859733581543
"Furthermore, although the economy will inevitably be buffeted by various shocks, the knowledge that the monetary authority will take steps to move inflation gradually toward its mandate-consistent rate over time also helps minimize the deviations of employment and output from maximum sustainable levels.",2007-11-29,NO-EFFECT,0.9105379581451416
"The Longer-Term Projections for Growth and UnemploymentFor 2010, the central tendency of the range of projections for the growth of real GDP is 2.5 percent to 2.6 percent, and the projections for the unemployment rate have a central tendency of 4.7 percent to 4.9 percent.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.9189346432685852
The full range of FOMC participants' projections is 2.2 percent to 2.7 percent for real GDP growth and 4.6 percent to 5.0 percent for the unemployment rate.,2007-11-29,STABLE,0.9034399390220642
"As indicated in the forecast narrative, these longer-run projections were heavily influenced by participants' assessments of the sustainable rates of output growth and employment.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.6839703917503357
"However, assessments of potential output growth and the sustainable unemployment rate are fundamentally different from assessments of the mandate-consistent inflation rate.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.5157610177993774
"In particular, as I emphasized in a speech last spring, the Federal Reserve can determine and achieve the long-run average rate of inflation in keeping with its dual mandate, but the Federal Reserve most emphatically cannot choose the level of maximum sustainable economic activity--no central bank can control the level of real economic activity or employment over the longer run (Mishkin, 2007a).",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.8247923851013184
"In addition, the maximum sustainable levels of output and employment cannot be known with any assurance (Mishkin, 2007b).",2007-11-29,NO-EFFECT,0.709514319896698
The relatively narrow range of participants' longer-term projections for real GDP growth and the rate of unemployment must not be confused with the uncertainty attending those projections.,2007-11-29,STABLE,0.7091385126113892
"In that regard, macroeconometric analysis indicates that the sustainable unemployment rate and the growth rate of potential output have varied quite substantially over recent decades, thereby exacerbating the challenges of constructing estimates of these characteristics at any given point in time.",2007-11-29,NO-EFFECT,0.5561463832855225
"For example, Staiger, Stock, and Watson (1997a,b) obtained 95 percent confidence intervals for a measure of the sustainable unemployment rate that are at least 2 percentage points wide.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.9534119963645935
"Thus, although FOMC participants' projections for the unemployment rate in 2010 provide information about their assessments of the sustainable unemployment rate, the analysis of Staiger, Stock, and Watson highlights the degree of uncertainty about these assessments--namely, the true value of that rate might well be as low as 3-3/4 percent or as high as 5-3/4 percent.",2007-11-29,NO-EFFECT,0.9515594244003296
The Science of Monetary Policy and the Shorter-Term ProjectionsNow let us take a brief look at the Federal Reserve's macroeconomic projections for 2007 through 2009.,2007-11-29,STABLE,0.9811981320381165
"These projections are useful for understanding the Federal Reserve's near-term policy strategy, and again, I would like to highlight how this strategy fulfills the dual mandate and embeds key implications of the modern science of monetary policy.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.9576786756515503
The science emphasizes that monetary policy makers need to think in terms of a plan for the appropriate paths for inflation and economic activity that best promotes the dual mandate of price stability and maximum sustainable employment.,2007-11-29,STABLE,0.8582757711410522
"If economic activity is well below its maximum sustainable level, then monetary policy should aim at increasing output and employment toward sustainable levels.",2007-11-29,NO-EFFECT,0.6186464428901672
"If inflation is above the mandate-consistent rate, monetary policy should aim at reducing inflation to that rate.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.6919747591018677
"Providing projections for the short run as well as for the longer run encourages FOMC participants to think in terms of desirable paths for inflation and output, a discipline that the science suggests will produce better policy outcomes.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.9180419445037842
"The Inflation OutlookIn the projections of FOMC participants, core inflation edges down slightly and then remains fairly stable at about 1-3/4 percent toward the end of the decade.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.7272360920906067
"Meanwhile, given an anticipated flattening out of energy prices, overall consumer inflation in these projections declines toward the core inflation rate; it drops from about 3 percent this year to about 2 percent in 2008 and then drops a bit further near the end of the decade.",2007-11-29,NO-EFFECT,0.7975034713745117
"These projections are consistent with a point I made in an earlier speech--namely, in recent decades core inflation has tended to be a good predictor of overall inflation further ahead (Mishkin, 2007c).",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.8909613490104675
"Furthermore, these projections demonstrate that FOMC participants do not think that the Federal Reserve should, or even could, achieve an immediate reduction of overall inflation to its mandate-consistent rate.",2007-11-29,NO-EFFECT,0.9699572920799255
The recent high level of overall inflation reflects rapidly rising energy prices that the Federal Reserve obviously cannot control.,2007-11-29,NO-EFFECT,0.7528117895126343
"For this reason, any attempt to bring overall inflation down too quickly would entail large losses of output and employment, and hence such an approach would be inconsistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate, which places a balanced emphasis on both price stability and maximum employment.",2007-11-29,NO-EFFECT,0.9688264727592468
The Outlook for Economic ActivityThe midpoint of the range of projections for real GDP growth declines noticeably from about 2-1/2 percent for 2007 to roughly 2 percent in 2008; then it returns to about 2-1/2 percent in 2009 and 2010.,2007-11-29,STABLE,0.8838329315185547
"As I have already noted, monetary policy works only with a lag and hence cannot offset these near-term effects; rather, the recent cuts in the federal funds rate are intended to help bring economic activity back to maximum sustainable levels over time, and such an outcome can be seen in the broad contours of the FOMC projections.",2007-11-29,NO-EFFECT,0.5337859988212585
There is considerable diversity in the views of participants about the outlook for near-term growth.,2007-11-29,NO-EFFECT,0.7182433009147644
"The range of forecasts for the growth of real GDP in 2008 is from 1.6 percent to 2.6 percent--twice as wide as in the previous set of FOMC projections, which were published last June.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.8141931891441345
These averages of projection errors indicate that the degree of uncertainty about the growth outlook is even wider than the range of the participants' forecasts.,2007-11-29,NO-EFFECT,0.8822391629219055
"For example, at a one-year forecast horizon, the root mean squared prediction error is 1.3 percentage points for the growth of real GDP and 0.6 percentage points for the unemployment rate, as compared to 1.0 percentage points and 0.4 percentage points respectively for participants' forecasts of real GDP growth and unemployment.",2007-11-29,STABLE,0.9493767023086548

"Although the current projections involve relatively stable trajectories for economic activity and inflation, the regular communication of Federal Reserve projections would become particularly useful in a setting in which the economy started from a position further away from its long-run balanced-growth path.",2007-11-29,NO-EFFECT,0.9759361147880554

The two key proximate sources of inflation pressure are excess demand and supply shocks.,1999-02-25,STABLE,0.8759526014328003

Supply shocks refer to the effect on inflation of changes in the prices of specific commodities that are unrelated to the balance between supply and demand in the domestic economy.,1999-02-25,STABLE,0.9192578196525574
"Historically, the important supply shocks have been sharp movements in food or energy prices, often related to weather and political developments.",1999-02-25,STABLE,0.7685072422027588
"In the current episode in the U.S., important sources of restraint in inflation have come from a decline in energy prices over the past two years; a three-year period, through mid 1998, of appreciation of the dollar and declining import prices; sharper-than-previous declines in computer prices over the past three years; and a slower rate of increase in health care prices, including the cost of health care insurance.",1999-02-25,VOLATILE,0.5271068215370178
The direct impact of supply shocks depends on the weight of the affected goods and services in broader price measures.,1999-02-25,STABLE,0.7866610288619995
Indirect effects arise both from the role of those goods and services as inputs in production and through the effect on the wage-price process.,1999-02-25,STABLE,0.9321845173835754
"A decline in overall inflation via favorable supply shocks lowers the pressure for nominal wage increases, which, in turn, reduces price pressures for a broader range of goods and services.",1999-02-25,STABLE,0.7251374125480652
"An increase in trend productivity growth will result in higher real wage growth, but the transition to higher real wages may include a near-term decline in inflation.",1999-02-25,NO-EFFECT,0.9368384480476379
"For example, an unexpected acceleration in productivity might initially leave nominal wage change unaffected, but reduce price pressures by lowering costs--thus contributing to both higher real wage growth and, for a while, lower inflation.",1999-02-25,NO-EFFECT,0.8441315293312073
One additional feature of recent experience that might also be important is the divergence between measures of labor market and product market demand balance.,1999-02-25,STABLE,0.7418846487998962
"While the unemployment rate has declined to a 28-year low and to well below prevailing estimates of NAIRU, the capacity utilization rate is below its long-term average and estimates of its natural rate.",1999-02-25,NO-EFFECT,0.6987377405166626
It appears that a portion of the higher productivity growth has come through capital deepening and more generally has been associated with very rapid growth in the capital stock--especially high-tech equipment.,1999-02-25,STABLE,0.5651018619537354
The relevance of this development is that the absence of demand pressures in product markets likely contributes to the perceived absence of pricing leverage by good-producing firms.,1999-02-25,STABLE,0.6630710363388062
"In addition, the resulting difficulty in passing on cost increases may have made firms more reluctant to bid up the price of workers in tight labor markets, resulting in restraint on nominal wage demands and contributing to the apparent decline in NAIRU.",1999-02-25,NO-EFFECT,0.991321861743927
"Collectively, these factors--favorable supply shocks, a lower NAIRU and higher trend growth, and the gap between the unemployment and capacity utilization rates--can explain the combination of higher-than-expected growth, a decline in the unemployment rate well below previous estimates of NAIRU, and lower-than-expected inflation.",1999-02-25,STABLE,0.8224591612815857

Both the consensus and FOMC forecasts projects higher inflation.,1999-02-25,STABLE,0.7069011330604553

The Challenges Facing U.S. Monetary Policy I now turn to the challenge of designing a strategy for monetary policy in light of uncertainties both about the sources of recent performance and about the outlook going forward.,1999-02-25,NO-EFFECT,0.8883629441261292
Implications of Supply Shocks and Structural Change for Monetary Policy The relative importance of supply shocks and structural change has important implications for monetary policy.,1999-02-25,STABLE,0.9284003973007202
"For example, if the recent exceptional U.S. economic performance were entirely due to the temporary effects of favorable supply shocks, the economy's level of production might be interpreted as being beyond its sustainable capacity, with the inflationary consequences temporarily suppressed by the favorable supply shocks.",1999-02-25,NO-EFFECT,0.8392531275749207
"The challenge for monetary policy would be to make the transition from the current exceptional but unsustainable state to a less exceptional but more sustainable one, prior to the supply shocks fully dissipating.",1999-02-25,NO-EFFECT,0.985571026802063
"On the other hand, if the recent performance is accounted for entirely by supply-enhancing structural changes and, therefore, reflects the new, more favorable performance characteristics of the U.S. economy, the role of monetary policy is to accommodate this more favorable performance rather than to constrain it.",1999-02-25,NO-EFFECT,0.6068016290664673
"The challenge is to set a strategy that respects this uncertainty, takes advantages of opportunities for better performance, while mitigating the risks of overtaxing the limits of sustainable production and growth.",1999-02-25,NO-EFFECT,0.9205254912376404
Monetary Policy Strategy: Principles and Practice Let me now turn to how U.S. monetary policy has responded during this episode and to the challenges that it faces going forward.,1999-02-25,STABLE,0.897379457950592
I will describe the evolution of monetary policy in relation to the strategy embodied in the Taylor Rule.,1999-02-25,STABLE,0.9563881754875183
The Taylor Rule prescribes movements in real interest rates in response to deviations of inflation from the policymakers' inflation target and to deviations of output from its long-run potential (or to deviations in the unemployment rate from its natural rate).,1999-02-25,STABLE,0.8803487420082092
These responses impose what I believe are the two key ingredients for a disciplined monetary policy strategy: a nominal anchor (via the inflation target) and a policy that leans against cyclical winds (via the response to changes in resource utilization rates).,1999-02-25,STABLE,0.7326244711875916
"During most of the recent episode, monetary policy broadly followed the Taylor Rule prescription, while holding the nominal federal funds rate about unchanged.",1999-02-25,STABLE,0.8594439625740051
"Since 1995, the simultaneous declines in the unemployment rate (as a result of faster than expected growth) and lower-than-expected inflation had almost perfectly offsetting effects on the target nominal federal funds rate.",1999-02-25,STABLE,0.9412113428115845
"The drop in the unemployment rate outweighed the fall in inflation in terms of the prescription for real rates, but the higher real federal funds rate prescribed by the Taylor Rule was achieved passively via declines in inflation, without the need for an increase in nominal funds rate.",1999-02-25,STABLE,0.8573874831199646
"More recently, however, monetary policy has significantly departed from the Taylor Rule prescription.",1999-02-25,NO-EFFECT,0.6180867552757263
"That is, the nominal funds rate today is lower than could be justified by typical Taylor Rules, given prevailing inflation and labor utilization rates.",1999-02-25,NO-EFFECT,0.5783722996711731
This was intended to ensure that monetary policy and overall financial conditions remained consistent with a forecast of a benign slowdown in U.S. growth.,1999-02-25,STABLE,0.812364935874939
"Specifically, even at prevailing financial conditions, weaker foreign growth threatened to transform what was otherwise expected to be a benign slowdown into one that might be excessive, particularly given what also appeared to be asymmetrical downside risks in the global economy.",1999-02-25,NO-EFFECT,0.9960777163505554
"But a forward-looking version of the Taylor Rule did, in my view, justify the policy action, at least given the revision in my own expectations for growth going forward.",1999-02-25,NO-EFFECT,0.7410802245140076

"Specifically, they added to the increase in growth in real activity and were the source of simultaneous declines in unemployment and core inflation during much of this period.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.8915504217147827
These developments have created a powerful set of crosscurrents that challenge monetary policymakers.,2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.9571608304977417
The demand effect refers to the stimulus to aggregate demand from the forces that underlie the acceleration in productivity.,2000-10-19,STABLE,0.9459977746009827
"The boom was triggered by the profitable opportunities associated with exploiting the new technologies, by the associated declines in the relative prices of high-tech equipment, and by the decline in the cost of financing high-tech investments as a result of higher equity prices.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.7430635690689087
The information technology revolution also set off a consumption boom triggered by the wealth effect associated with higher equity prices and by a projected higher path of labor income.,2000-10-19,STABLE,0.8307424783706665
"Recent experience suggests that this surge in demand may, at least for a while, overwhelm the increase in potential output growth, resulting in a steady decline in the unemployment rate.",2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.9367005825042725
"At the same time, an acceleration in productivity also appears to have a direct disinflationary effect.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.742974042892456
"This arises, in my view, because of an asymmetry in the response of wages and prices to the acceleration in productivity, perhaps because salaries and wages are typically adjusted only once a year or, perhaps because of wage norms that cause employees to expect compensation growth similar to the experience over previous years.",2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.6439029574394226
"Whatever the reason, nominal wages initially do not appear to respond very much to the acceleration in productivity.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.5500725507736206
"As a result, the higher productivity lowers the cost of production.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.9073836207389832
"This has the immediate effect of raising profits, but competition soon puts downward pressure on prices, lowering inflation.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.7658272385597229
"The lower inflation, in turn, restrains nominal wage demands, contributing for a time to a virtuous cycle of lower wage change and price inflation.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.47662675380706787
The demand and direct disinflationary effects have conflicting implications for inflation.,2000-10-19,STABLE,0.8069413304328918
"The above-trend growth associated with the demand effect lowers the unemployment rate, and the tighter labor market puts upward pressure on inflation.",2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.6952307224273682
"The direct disinflationary effect, on the other hand, lowers inflation for any given unemployment rate.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.940089762210846
"The net effect could be steady, rising, or falling inflation--depending on whether productivity continues to accelerate and on how low the unemployment rate is driven in the process.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.5586679577827454
"And, of course, the appropriate course of monetary policy depends on the balance between these two effects.2 The interaction of these two short-run effects can also be explained in terms of the relationship between the unemployment rate and the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU).",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.9477619528770447
The NAIRU is the unemployment rate consistent with steady inflation.,2000-10-19,STABLE,0.9210046529769897
"In computing the NAIRU, the customary practice is to abstract from shocks that directly affect inflation over and above the influence of demand pressure--for example, accelerations or decelerations in trend productivity and swings in the relative price of oil are not taken into consideration.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.9149201512336731
"In fact, if there were no shocks, the direction of inflation ultimately would be uniquely determined by the relationship between the unemployment rate and the NAIRU.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.9142633080482483
"But, of course, additional shocks almost always directly affect inflation, most often on the supply side of the economy.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.6082190871238708
"One, therefore, must take into account both the demand pressures captured by the relationship between the unemployment rate and the NAIRU and supply shocks.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.9038332104682922
"Because an acceleration in productivity initially lowers inflation for any given unemployment rate, it also lowers the unemployment rate consistent with steady inflation in the near term.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.8407758474349976
"That is, the direct disinflationary effect lowers the short-run NAIRU relative to its long-run value.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.8446031808853149
Whether or not inflation will rise or fall in the immediate aftermath of an acceleration in productivity cannot be judged therefore by comparing the actual unemployment rate to the estimate of the long-run NAIRU.,2000-10-19,STABLE,0.8525876998901367
The relevant comparison is between the current unemployment rate and an estimate of the short-run NAIRU that takes into account the disinflationary effect of the productivity shock.,2000-10-19,STABLE,0.9500837922096252
My preference is to estimate a short-run NAIRU that directly takes into account the disinflationary effect of an acceleration in productivity because the effects of an acceleration in productivity on inflation may persist long enough that the adjusted NAIRU might be useful in policy decisions.,2000-10-19,STABLE,0.8781688809394836
"On the other hand, I would leave out of such an estimation the effect of swings in oil prices, for example, because their effect on inflation dissipates more quickly.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.8794248700141907
"The demand and direct disinflationary effects are both temporary, but the period over which each has its influence depends on different considerations.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.7406551241874695
"The persistence of the demand effect depends on how long it takes for business capital stocks to adjust to higher expected profitability, for consumer durables to adjust to higher wealth and higher projected future income, and for market interest rates to close the gap relative to the higher equilibrium real interest rate.",2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.9540672898292542
"The direct disinflationary effect of an acceleration in productivity is, in my view, temporary because it likely arises from the lag in the adjustment of nominal wages to the productivity acceleration.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.6838149428367615
It dissipates gradually once productivity growth stabilizes and nominal wages catch up to the productivity acceleration.,2000-10-19,STABLE,0.6344870328903198
How rapidly this effect dissipates depends on how quickly productivity growth stabilizes and how rapidly nominal wage gains adjust to the higher productivity growth.,2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.6445834636688232
A similar sluggish adjustment of nominal wages to productivity developments following the productivity slowdown in the early 1970s may have contributed to the sharp increase in inflation thereafter.3 Let me try to make a rough estimate of the direct disinflationary effect of the acceleration in productivity and the associated decline in the short-run NAIRU.,2000-10-19,STABLE,0.8837062120437622
The first step is to estimate the acceleration in trend productivity.,2000-10-19,STABLE,0.8826726078987122
If productivity has increased from 1-1/2 percent during the period from the early 1970s to the mid-1990s to the upper end of the estimate today--say 3-1/2 percent--then the total acceleration in productivity would be 2 percentage points.,2000-10-19,STABLE,0.9179754853248596
"If nominal wages do not immediately respond, the growth in labor costs will fall by precisely the same amount as the increase in the growth of labor productivity.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.5976122617721558
"In this case, the direct disinflationary effect simply equals the acceleration in productivity.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.9490991234779358
"However, the magnitude of the direct effect will diminish over time as wage growth catches up to the faster productivity growth, unless of course productivity continues to accelerate, as has been the case over the last several years.",2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.9571743607521057
"Because wages have likely already partially adjusted to the cumulative increase in productivity growth during the last several years, the portion of the acceleration still putting downward pressure on inflation may be somewhat less than 2 percentage points.",2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.5669900178909302
A simple way of judging the magnitude of the direct disinflationary effect is to calculate the difference between the current estimate of trend productivity and a moving average of this trend.,2000-10-19,STABLE,0.9638548493385315
The length of the moving average should be an estimate of the time it takes for nominal wages to fully respond to higher productivity growth.,2000-10-19,STABLE,0.9242357611656189
"In figure 2, I plot a measure of the direct disinflationary effect using a forty-quarter moving average of trend productivity.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.9454830288887024
A ten-year moving average probably provides an upper end of the estimate of the direct disinflationary effect.,2000-10-19,STABLE,0.9214716553688049
"As you can see, this upper-end estimate is that the cumulative productivity acceleration is lowering inflation today by 1-1/2 percentage points, for any given unemployment rate.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.9200443029403687
"Note that when this effect is positive, as it has been since the mid-1990s, it is a disinflationary effect and when it is negative--as it was following the decline in trend productivity growth after the early 1970s--it is an inflationary effect.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.9247894883155823
The power and persistence of the direct disinflationary effect depends on both the pattern of the productivity acceleration and the speed of the adjustment process--specifically how fast wages respond directly to the productivity acceleration.,2000-10-19,STABLE,0.7780601978302002
"If the adjustment is very drawn out as shown in figure 2, then the direct disinflationary effect would have been quite large and this effect would continue to be important for some time, even once productivity growth stabilizes.",2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.991575300693512
"But if the adjustment were more rapid, the disinflationary effects of the acceleration in productivity would have been less powerful and would dissipate more rapidly once productivity growth stabilizes.",2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.9361844658851624
These alternative moving averages translate into a range of 1/2 to 1-1/2 percentage points for the direct disinflationary effect of the acceleration in productivity growth.,2000-10-19,STABLE,0.8443096280097961
"In figure 3, I have assumed that the long-run NAIRU is 5-1/2 percent and that the long-run NAIRU has varied over the period from 1960 until today only in response to the effect of demographic changes on the average unemployment rate.4 As I explain in somewhat more detail in the appendix, I estimate the short-run NAIRU by subtracting the direct disinflationary effect of changes in trend productivity from the estimate of the long-run NAIRU.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.9648715853691101
This has the convenient property that the bottom end of the range is consistent with the prevailing unemployment rate and would support the view that we might be approaching a type of soft landing--a convergence of growth to trend at a point when the unemployment rate is already at the short-run NAIRU.,2000-10-19,STABLE,0.4778103828430176
"In this case, there would not be any immediate upward pressure on core inflation.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.9174365997314453
"The range also has the property that its mid-point value of the short-run is above the prevailing unemployment rate, implying some upward pressure on core inflation over the near term.",2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.9666487574577332
The Favorable Policy Choice as the Economy Adjusts to an Acceleration in Productivity Policymakers face a choice when confronted with an acceleration in productivity--a choice among very favorable outcomes.,2000-10-19,STABLE,0.9010013341903687
"They can take the benefits of an acceleration in productivity in temporarily higher output (that is, a temporarily lower unemployment rate) or in lower inflation or in some combination of temporarily lower unemployment and lower inflation.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.8335632681846619
"It depends on policymakers' preferences, as well as on where inflation is relative to policymakers' long-run inflation goal at the outset of the acceleration in productivity.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.8426685929298401
The outcome also likely will depend on how quickly policymakers realize that productivity has accelerated and learn how the economy responds to this development.,2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.9300540089607239
The response of monetary policy to the acceleration in productivity determines this choice.,2000-10-19,STABLE,0.9177473187446594
How have the benefits of the acceleration in productivity been taken in this episode?,2000-10-19,STABLE,0.7953853607177734
"To assess the outcome, it is most useful to look at the pattern of core measures of consumer price inflation--specifically measures of inflation based on the core PCE and the core CPI--during this period.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.9162420034408569
I interpret the evidence as suggesting that we have taken a large part of the benefits of the acceleration in productivity in temporarily higher output and a smaller portion in the form of lower inflation.,2000-10-19,STABLE,0.8233413100242615
"But let me emphasize again that the outcome of this choice is not simply a reflection of policymakers preferences, but also of how quickly the policymakers came to understand the size of the productivity acceleration and how it was affecting the choices they face.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.5861523747444153
The Monetary Policy Response: The Two-step There is considerable uncertainty today about the NAIRU.,2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.8274102807044983
"While there is, to be sure, uncertainty about the long-run NAIRU, I expect much of the uncertainty today has followed from the effect of an acceleration of productivity on the short-run NAIRU.",2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.541008472442627
"At the risk of some oversimplification, recent monetary policy could be viewed as part of a two-step strategy that takes into account the uncertainty about the NAIRU.",2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.6417215466499329
The first step is to slow the growth in real output to trend to stabilize the unemployment rate at the lower end of the range of estimates of the short-run NAIRU.,2000-10-19,STABLE,0.6457330584526062
"Thereafter comes step two, which is to apply a more reactive and less pre-emptive monetary policy.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.57430100440979
"That is, policy is then focused on testing whether or not the prevailing unemployment rate is sustainable with steady inflation.",2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.49960073828697205
"If not, then monetary policy would respond to higher inflation by raising real interest rates.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.5193536281585693
"That is, even if the unemployment rate today is consistent with the short-run NAIRU, the short-run NAIRU may have to rise over time as it converges toward the long-run NAIRU, at least once productivity growth stabilizes (or increases in productivity growth slow by a sufficient amount).",2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.977787971496582
A Transition to Below-Trend Growth and Rising Inflation?,2000-10-19,STABLE,0.5732025504112244
"From the end of 1995 until mid-2000, growth had been above trend and, as a result, the unemployment rate had been declining.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.9431065320968628
"For much of the period, core inflation was declining.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.8441817760467529
"I believe the economy will ultimately be confronted by a transition and that we may already be in this transition, specifically to slower growth and perhaps also higher core inflation.",2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.9914064407348633
"The consensus private-sector forecast is for the growth in real GDP to slip below trend in the third quarter, then post a modest rebound in the fourth quarter, and continue in 2001 at a pace that will keep the unemployment rate nearly steady.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.4878486394882202
"The consensus forecast also appears to be consistent with relatively stable core inflation, implying that the prevailing unemployment rate may be sustainable and that monetary policy may have succeeded in achieving a soft landing.",2000-10-19,VOLATILE,0.5653961300849915
"If so, monetary policy would have achieved a soft landing for the second time in the same expansion--a truly extraordinary feat.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.8685348033905029
"Even if growth in real GDP remains at or modestly below trend for a period, there are, in my view, two potential sources of upward pressure on inflation over the next few years.",2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.9917585253715515
The first is the possibility that the unemployment rate today is below the short-run NAIRU.,2000-10-19,STABLE,0.8636631369590759
"The central tendency for my estimate of the short-run NAIRU, for example, is above the prevailing unemployment rate, suggesting the potential for some upward creep on core inflation.",2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.8929376602172852
The second source of higher inflation would be the gradual convergence of the short-run NAIRU to the long-run NAIRU should productivity growth stabilize and the direct disinflationary effect wane.,2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.8780025243759155
"Unless the actual unemployment rate rises as this convergence progresses, the rise in the short-run NAIRU would result in further upward pressure in inflation.",2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.9867154955863953
An important uncertainty in the forecast is the sustainability of the current rate of trend productivity growth.,2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.7922160625457764
"For example, in the near term, the robust pace of capital spending could yield still higher productivity growth--through further increases in the ratio of capital services to labor, one of the principal sources of higher productivity growth.",2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.5477491021156311
"Over a still longer period--and this may be several years to a decade or longer--it is quite possible that productivity growth, after reaching a peak, will then diminish.",2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.9903367757797241
"If the acceleration in productivity reflects the bunching of technological innovations, the completion of their spread will signal that productivity has moved to its new, higher level and the growth in productivity may then diminish to a rate more consistent with its long-run historical average.",2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.9745079278945923
Such a deceleration in productivity would bring with it the reverse of the favorable conditions that initially accompanied the acceleration in productivity--a choice between a higher unemployment rate and higher inflation and likely a combination of the two.,2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.9555118680000305

"If growth turns out to be close to trend for a while, the unemployment rate will stabilize at its prevailing value and core inflation will rise to the extent that the unemployment rate is below the short-run NAIRU.",2000-10-19,STABLE,0.622553288936615
Inflation will rise further over time to the degree that the NAIRU moves toward its long-run value.,2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.8052018284797668
The most benign outcome in this case might be a period of below-trend growth that would gradually reestablish a sustainable unemployment rate accompanied by a more modest increase in inflation.,2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.8361488580703735
Given the uncertainty about this analysis--especially about the values of the short-run and long-run NAIRU--it is difficult to design a pre-emptive policy aimed at foreclosing the risk of higher inflation.,2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.9398308992385864

"It is important to recognize, however, that there are options between a preemptive response based on the relationship between the unemployment rate and the NAIRU and a totally reactive approach of responding only to higher inflation itself.",2000-10-19,NO-EFFECT,0.7319769263267517
