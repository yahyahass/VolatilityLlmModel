"May 26, 2021 The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy Vice Chair for Supervision Randal K. Quarles At the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy, The Brookings Institution, Washington, D.C. (via webcast) Share Watch Live Thank you, David, and thank you to Brookings and the Hutchins Center for the opportunity to lead things off and be part of this very distinguished panel.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9998168349266052
"Today, I will explain why I expect the U.S. economy to continue growing strongly over the remainder of this year and what the implications of that outlook are for monetary policy.1 After the shutdowns and other measures taken in response to the COVID-19 outbreak last spring caused the swiftest and deepest recession in U.S. history, the economy has made a powerful recovery.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.999794065952301
"Households and businesses adapted, supported by the flexibility and inherent strength of our market-based economy, by the continued resilience of our banking system, and by significant fiscal and monetary policy support.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997038245201111
"Highly accommodative monetary policy by the Federal Reserve has fostered strong growth in interest rateâ€“sensitive sectors of the economy such as housing and durable goods, offsetting some of the historic weakness in the service sector last year.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997884631156921
"With the service sector reopening while other household and business spending remains strong, I expect rapid growth to continue for some time before slowing to a still robust pace next year.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9998058676719666
"Inflation is running significantly above the Federal Reserve's longer-run goal of 2 percent primarily as a result of three factors: the surge in demand as more services come back on line while goods spending remains robust, the emergence of bottlenecks in some supply chains, and the very low inflation readings recorded last spring dropping out of the calculation of 12-month inflation.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997885823249817
"For reasons I will detail in a moment, I expect that a significant portion of that recent boost to inflation will be transitory, and that it will not interfere with the rapid growth driving progress toward the Fed's maximum-employment goal.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9998025298118591
"The progress in reopening has been slower in countries that are among our largest trading partners, weighing on U.S. growth by reducing demand for U.S. exports.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997013211250305
"First, I see increasing recognition by the private and public sectors that a broad reopening can proceed safely.i The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has dropped most social-distancing recommendations for vaccinated people.2 Although local COVID-19 restrictions on schooling and economic activity continue in some areas, most schools are teaching in person at least part time and more than half of states have dropped all capacity constraints on restaurants, bars, and retail establishments.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997783303260803
"Again, a lot of that reflected the most recent round of stimulus payments, but as employment grows and people return to normal life and work, the accumulated stock of savings will support spending for many months to come.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9998058676719666
"Strong U.S. demand is boosting imports, but weaker demand outside the United States, where recovery is slower, is restraining exports, and that problem may not resolve for some time.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997192025184631
"Supply bottlenecks are more prevalent now, especially in the auto and housing industries, with shortages of inputs leading to slower production that reduces employment growth.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997013211250305
"Although I expect employment to rise significantly in coming months, the picture is more mixed for the labor market than it is for spending.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997748732566833
"The unemployment rate remains at 6.1 percent, compared with 3.5 percent pre-COVID-19, and there are 8 million fewer jobs.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9996716976165771
"Despite recent gains amid reopenings, employment in the travel, leisure, and food services sectors remains well below pre-pandemic levels.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997459053993225
"My optimism here reflects the apparent recovery in overall labor demandâ€”by many metrics, job openings are above 2019 levels, including for workers without a college degree, a group especially affected last year.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997900128364563
"In the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey data for March, private-sector job openings as a percentage of total employment increased to 5.6 percent, which is above the previous record for that series set in November 2018.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997695088386536
"Job growth of 266,000 in April was a disappointing slowdown from recent months, but good news lurked beneath the headlines: For those who were working, average hours increased; the number of people working part time because they couldn't find full-time jobs decreased significantly; and wage growth was very strong.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997912049293518
"And, although the evidence is mixed, we have received plenty of anecdotal reports about the influence of generous unemployment benefits and large cash payments on the willingness of workers to return to work.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997590184211731
"Now let's turn to the other half of the Federal Reserve's economic goals, inflation.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9998012185096741
"As I mentioned last week during congressional testimony, I agree with the widespread view among my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and most private forecasters that the recent rise in inflation to well above 2 percent is driven by temporary factors.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997891783714294
I expect inflation to begin subsiding at some point over the next several months and to be running close to 2 percent again at some point during 2022.,2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997716546058655
"Market-implied inflation expectations have risen only to the levels that prevailed in the early 2010s, after which inflation never ran consistently above 2 percent, and most survey measures are sending similar signals.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9998118281364441
"Therefore, I consider these recent increases in inflation expectations a welcome development, reversing the large declines seen last spring and perhaps edging up in response to the message in the FOMC's new policy framework.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.999764621257782
"That said, my optimistic outlook for growth and employment places me among those who see the risks to inflation over the medium term as weighted to the upside, relative to my baseline forecast.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997655749320984
"A moment ago, I celebrated the upturn in wages in April, but it may be a sign that the torrid growth of the economy and labor supply shortages have begun pushing up wages faster than occurred with the moderate economic growth over much of the past decade.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997453093528748
Wages are a large component of business costs that could pass through to prices more readily than increases in the cost of other inputs.,2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997687935829163
"It seems like a paradox that there could be labor supply problems and wage pressures at 6 percent unemployment, but it is also a fact.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997366070747375
It is reasonable to ask if the strength of spending stemming from this unprecedented fiscal stimulus will put significant upward pressure on inflation as households and businesses emerge further from the COVID event.,2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997807145118713
"But, at least to date, the latest round of stimulus seems to be supporting spending and growth without causing an inordinate rise in interest rates or inflation expectations.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997794032096863
"That outcome aligns with the advice of those in the economics profession who have produced research in recent years that leaves them much more comfortable with high deficits and debt, at least in countries with low interest rates, than they used to be.4 In 2006, when I was serving as Under Secretary of the Treasury, we were subject to harsh criticism for running a deficit of not quite $250 billion, with total debt held by the public at 35 percent of GDP.5 By contrast, in 2021, the deficit is currently projected to be $3.4 trillion, and total debt held by the public at the end of fiscal year 2020 was 100 percent of GDP.6 Further fiscal policy actions are, of course, the purview of the Congress and the Administration.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9996699094772339
Surely the deficits being run to offset the COVID-related shocks have made it even more critical to address the sustainability of government debt in the years ahead.,2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9996955394744873
"And, finally, recent monthly readings on import prices, producer prices, and consumer prices have all come in above consensus expectations.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997887015342712
"It is true that many of the factors driving the April consumer price index report and other inflation surprises continue to be supply bottlenecks, and it is reasonable to conclude that these will ease over time.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9998089671134949
"If these shortages persist into 2022, people may adjust their expectations higher for future inflation, which could make above-target inflation more persistent than we currently expect.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.998822033405304
"We designed our new monetary policy framework for the very different world we live in now, which involves an equilibrium for the economy with slow workforce growth, lower potential growth, lower underlying inflation, and, therefore, lower interest rates.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997881054878235
"One of those differences is that the kinds of ""wage-price spirals"" that characterized inflation dynamics in the 1970s have not been present for a long time.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997949004173279
It's quite possible that this situation now prevails because inflation is never high enough for long enough to enter decisionmaking in a material way.,2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997336268424988
"So, what are the implications for monetary policy?",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997923970222473
I am fully committed to the FOMC's new monetary policy framework and the two pieces of related guidance that we have put in place for asset purchases and the federal funds rate to implement that framework.,2021-05-26,TRUST,0.999771773815155
"The guidance on asset purchases, introduced in December, commits us to increasing our holdings of securities at least at the current pace until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum-employment and price-stability goals.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9998010993003845
"My personal view is that the rise in inflationâ€”even after discounting temporary factorsâ€”and inflation expectations since December will prove sufficient to satisfy the standard for inflation in the guidance around asset purchases later this year, but improvement in the labor market has been slower than I would have liked.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.999772846698761
"For instance, the unemployment rate has decreased only 0.6 percentage points to 6.1 percent, and the labor force participation rate is still nearly the same as it was at the time of the December meeting.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997426867485046
"Therefore, we need to remain patient in the face of what seem to be transitory shocks to prices and wages so long as inflation expectations continue to fluctuate around levels that are consistent with our longer-run inflation goal.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997870326042175
The best analysis we currently have is that the rise in inflation to well above our target will be temporary.,2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997689127922058
"Part of the calculus in balancing the risks of either overshooting or undershooting our 2 percent goal is that the Fed has the tools to address inflation that runs too high, while it is more difficult to raise inflation that falls below target.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9998025298118591
"If we're wrong, we know how to bring inflation down.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997448325157166
"But if our assessment is correct that inflation is temporary, it would be unwise for us to take actions that might slow the recovery prematurely by trying to stay ahead of inflation, when our best estimate is that we are not far behind.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997925162315369
"If my expectations about economic growth, employment, and inflation over the coming months are borne out, however, and especially if they come in stronger than I expect, then, as noted in the minutes of the last FOMC meeting, it will become important for the FOMC to begin discussing our plans to adjust the pace of asset purchases at upcoming meetings.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997027516365051
"In particular, we may need additional public communications about the conditions that constitute substantial further progress since December toward our broad and inclusive definition of maximum employment.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997500777244568
"This standard presents inherent communications challenges because it cannot be summarized by a single labor market indicator, such as the unemployment rate thresholds used in the Committee's interest rate forward guidance between late 2012 and late 2013.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9998117089271545
"In contrast, the time for discussing a change in the federal funds rate remains in the future.i The guidance for the federal funds rate commits to maintain the current rate until labor market conditions are consistent with our goal of maximum employment and inflation not only has reached 2 percent, but also is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9998168349266052
"In the FOMC's most recent Summary of Economic Projections, no participantsâ€”even those with optimistic growth forecasts such as I've outlined todayâ€”thought it appropriate that liftoff occur before 2022.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9996821880340576
"Thus, I expect that monetary policy will remain highly accommodative for some time.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.999771773815155
"As the Fed's most recent Financial Stability Report notes, the bright outlook, ample supply of credit, and accommodative fiscal and monetary policy have pushed some asset valuations to very high levels that could be subject to sharp reversals if expectations are not met.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997565150260925
"Banks met extraordinary demands for credit last spring from nonfinancial businesses and households while simultaneously providing forbearance on millions of existing loans and building substantial loss reserves, all without significant strains to their overall health.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997749924659729
"Household credit is primarily owed by borrowers with prime credit scores, rising home prices have most homeowners flush with equity, and, as I noted earlier, households are sitting on a large stock of savings.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997974038124084
"It is true that there are structural vulnerabilities in the nonbank financial sector, particularly money funds and hedge funds, and these are being scrutinized by U.S. and international authorities, including the Financial Stability Board under my chairmanship.7 But I believe these risks are manageable, and I come down on the side of the research that concludes these and other concerns are best addressed by targeted financial regulation and supervision rather than the blunt tool of monetary policy.8 At a crucial moment in our recovery from the COVID-19 event, the utility of using monetary policy to try to address financial stability concerns would be greatly outweighed by the costs to employment and growth.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997186064720154
"While prices will run above our 2 percent target this year, I believe most of this increase will be transitory.",2021-05-26,TRUST,0.9997735619544983
"High inflation imposes costs on all households, and especially low-income households.",2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9997475743293762
"The multiple waves of the pandemic, combined with Russia's war against Ukraine, unleashed a series of supply shocks hitting goods, labor, and commodities that, in combination with strong demand, have contributed to ongoing high inflation.",2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9997103810310364
"With a series of inflationary supply shocks, it is especially important to guard against the risk that households and businesses could start to expect inflation to remain above 2 percent in the longer run, which would make it much more challenging to bring inflation back down to our target.",2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9989573955535889
"The Federal Reserve is taking action to keep inflation expectations anchored and bring inflation back to 2 percent over time.1 While last year's rapid pace of economic growth was boosted by accommodative fiscal and monetary policy as well as reopening, demand has moderated this year as those tailwinds have abated.",2022-09-07,TRUST,0.999687671661377
A sizable fiscal drag on output growth alongside a sharp tightening in financial conditions has contributed to a slowing in activity.,2022-09-07,TRUST,0.999748170375824
"In the first half of 2022, real gross domestic product (GDP) declined outright, overall real consumer spending grew at just one-fourth of its 2021 pace, and residential investment, a particularly interest-sensitive sector, declined by 8 percent (figure 2).2 The concentration of strong consumer spending in supply-constrained sectors has contributed to high inflation.",2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9996916055679321
"Real spending on goods has declined modestly in each of the past two quarters, while real spending on services has expanded at about half its 2021 growth rate.",2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9997782111167908
"In addition to the fiscal drag and tighter financial conditions, high inflationâ€”particularly in food and gas pricesâ€”has restrained consumer spending by reducing real purchasing power.",2022-09-07,TRUST,0.99968421459198
"While price increases in food and energy are weighing on discretionary spending by all Americans, they are especially hard on low-income families, who spend three-fourths of their income on necessities such as food, gas, and shelterâ€”more than double the 31 percent for high-income households.3 Since the very elevated prices at the pump in June, the nationwide average price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline has declined every day throughout July and August, most recently falling below $4 a gallon, according to the American Automobile Association.4 The rise and fall of gasoline prices played a major role in the dynamics of inflation over the summer, contributing 0.4 percentage point to month-over-month personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation in June and subtracting 0.2 percentage point in July.",2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9997783303260803
This 0.6 percentage point swing in the contribution of gasoline prices was an important driver of the decline in month-over-month PCE inflation from 1 percent in June to negative 0.1 percent in July.,2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9997885823249817
"In contrast, food price pressures continue to worsen, reflecting Russia's continuing war against Ukraine, as well as extreme weather events in the United States, Europe, and China.5 The PCE index for food and beverages has increased each month this year by an average of 1.2 percent, resulting in an 8-1/2 percent cumulative increase in the index year-to-date through July.",2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9997511506080627
"For context, the net change in the food and beverages price index over the entire four-year period before the pandemic was only 0.5 percent.",2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9997643828392029
Core inflationâ€”inflation excluding volatile food and energy pricesâ€”also moderated in July.,2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9997788071632385
"Core goods PCE inflation decelerated to 0.1 percent month-over-month in July after averaging 0.5 percent in May and June.6 While the moderation in monthly inflation is welcome, it will be necessary to see several months of low monthly inflation readings to be confident that inflation is moving back down to 2 percent.",2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9997838139533997
"How long it takes to move inflation back down to 2 percent will depend on a combination of continued easing in supply constraints, slower demand growth, and lower markups, against the backdrop of anchored expectations.",2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9997915625572205
"In addition, labor force participation showed a welcome increase in the August employment data, particularly in the boost in participation among women in the core working years of 25 to 54 years of age.",2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9997811913490295
Last year's rapid demand growth in the face of supply constraints led to product shortages in some areas of the economy and high margins for many firms.,2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9997702240943909
"Although we are hearing some reports of large retailers planning markdowns due to excess inventories, we do not have hard data at an aggregate level suggesting that businesses are reducing margins in response to more price sensitivity among customers.",2022-09-07,TRUST,0.999761164188385
"At an aggregate level, in the second quarter, measures of profits in the nonfinancial sector relative to GDP remained near the postwar peak reached last year.7 Using the available macroeconomic data, it is challenging to measure directly how much firms mark up their prices relative to their costs.",2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9997925162315369
"After moving together closely for several years, starting early last year, the new motor vehicle consumer price index (CPI), which measures the price dealers charge to customers, diverged from the equivalent producer price index (PPI), which measures the price dealers paid to manufacturers.",2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9997910857200623
This divergence between retail and wholesale prices suggests an unusually large retail auto margin.,2022-09-07,TRUST,0.999767005443573
"With production now increasing, and interest-sensitive demand cooling, there may soon be pressures to reduce vehicle margins and prices in order to move the higher volume of cars being produced off dealer lots.",2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9997311234474182
"Similarly, overall retail marginsâ€”the difference between the price retailers charge for a good and the price retailers paid for that goodâ€”have risen significantly more than the average hourly wage that retailers pay workers to stock shelves and serve customers over the past year, suggesting that there may also be scope for reductions in retail margins.",2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9995747208595276
"With gross retail margins amounting to about 30 percent of sales, a reduction in currently elevated margins could make an important contribution to reduced inflation pressures in consumer goods.",2022-09-07,TRUST,0.999690055847168
"Labor demand continues to exhibit considerable strength, which is hard to reconcile with the more downbeat tone of activity.",2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9997463822364807
"Year-to-date through August, payroll employment has increased by about 3-1/2 million jobs, a surprisingly strong increase given the decelerating spending and declining GDP over the first half of the year.",2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9997978806495667
"The unemployment rate has fallen, on net, from 4 percent in January to 3.7 percent in August.",2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9997829794883728
"Possibly the strongest indications that the labor market is tight were the first- and second-quarter readings of the employment cost index (ECI), which point to strong and broad-based growth in total hourly compensation.",2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9998021721839905
The 6.3 percent reading for the ECI in the second quarter was the largest annualized quarterly growth in compensation under this metric since 1982.,2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9997630715370178
"The deceleration in economic activity thus far this year has coincided with only a slight easing in job openings, on net, since their peak in March.",2022-09-07,TRUST,0.99978107213974
Businesses that experienced unprecedented challenges restoring or expanding their workforces following the pandemic may be more inclined to make greater efforts to retain their employees than they normally would when facing a slowdown in economic activity.,2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9997627139091492
"This may mean that slowing aggregate demand will lead to a smaller increase in unemployment than we have seen in previous recessions, but it is too early to draw any definitive conclusions, and I will be monitoring a variety of labor market indicators closely.8 As we follow through on our plan to move monetary policy to an appropriately restrictive stance, the effect of the increased policy rate and pace of balance sheet shrinkage should put downward pressure on aggregate demand, particularly in interest-sensitive sectors like housing.",2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9997839331626892
Continued improvements in supply conditions and a further rotation of consumption away from goods and into services should also help by reducing price pressures in goods.,2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9997937083244324
"With regard to non-housing services, the magnitude of price pressure over the next several quarters will depend on an overall slowing in spending as well as the extent to which labor supply improves in these sectors.",2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9997733235359192
The rapid tightening in monetary policy is also reflected in a significant increase in the projected real short rate: The Blue Chip Financial Forecasts has the expected short rate moving above 0.5 percent in real terms to a significantly higher level than pre-pandemic within the next 12 months (figure 6).,2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9997509121894836
The disinflationary process here at home should be reinforced by weaker demand and tightening in many other countries.,2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9997653365135193
"The rapidity of the tightening cycle and its global nature, as well as the uncertainty around the pace at which the effects of tighter financial conditions are working their way through aggregate demand, create risks associated with overtightening.",2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9997363686561584
"Following a lengthy sequence of adverse supply shocks to goods, labor, and commodities that, in combination with strong demand, drove inflation to multidecade highs, we must maintain a risk-management posture to defend the inflation expectations anchor.9 While we have no control over the supply shocks to food, energy, labor, or semiconductors, we have both the capacity and the responsibility to maintain anchored inflation expectations and price stability.",2022-09-07,TRUST,0.99973064661026

"As of this month, the maximum monthly reduction in the balance sheet will be nearly double the level of the previous cycle.10 Together, the increase in the policy rate and the reduction in the balance sheet should help bring demand into alignment with supply.",2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9997377991676331
Monetary policy will need to be restrictive for some time to provide confidence that inflation is moving down to target.,2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9997259974479675
"While the precise course of action will depend on the evolution of the outlook, I am confident we will achieve a return to 2 percent inflation.",2022-09-07,TRUST,0.9997661709785461
I am going to offer some interpretations of the outlook as a context for the recent policy action by the Federal Reserve and explain how I view this action as part of a prudent and systematic strategy for monetary policy.,1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997817873954773
"Before proceeding, let me emphasize that the views on the economic outlook and monetary policy strategy I present this afternoon are my own.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.999803364276886
"Fourth, I'll offer several interpretations of the policy action in relation to what I believe are important aspects of the strategy of monetary policy.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9998120665550232
The Analytical Framework Let me remind you at the outset of the framework I have been using to explain the challenge facing monetary policy in the current environment of healthy growth and high levels of resource utilization.,1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9998176693916321
The risk of higher inflation in this environment has two dimensions.,1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997701048851013
"First, there is the risk that current utilization rates are already so high that inflation will gradually increase over time.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997356534004211
"Second, there is the risk that the growth in output will be above trend going forward, implying that utilization rates will rise from their already high level, compounding the risk of higher inflation.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9995445609092712
"Some apparently believe there are no speed limits, and no utilization rate can be so elevated that it threatens higher inflation.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997184872627258
"The reality is that above-trend growth raises utilization rates and, after some point, excessively high utilization rates result in higher inflation.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997684359550476
"But it is also true that threshold utilization rates and trend growth can change, that the current threshold levels for both utilization and growth rates are uncertain, that inflation can be affected by factors other than excess demand, and that policy is not infallible.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997941851615906
"This means that it was undertaken not in response to where the economy and inflation were at the time of the policy change, but in response to where the economy and inflation were projected to be in the future, absent a policy change.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9998095631599426
"Such policy action necessarily involves a forecast and such a forecast typically is grounded in some model that relates growth, unemployment, wage change and inflation, among other variables.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9998024106025696
So let me be specific about the causal structure of the model that underpins my judgment with respect to appropriate monetary policy action.,1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997851252555847
"First, the proximate source of an increase in inflation is excess demand in labor and/or product markets.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997877478599548
"In the labor market, this excess demand gap is often expressed in this model as the difference between the prevailing unemployment rate and NAIRU, the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9998053908348083
"Second, once an excess demand gap opens up, inflation increases indefinitely and progressively until the excess demand gap is closed, and then stabilizes at the higher level until cumulative excess supply gaps reverse the process.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997610449790955
"There is a third principle that I subscribe to, which, though not as fundamental as the first two, also plays a role in my forecast and in my judgment about the appropriate posture of monetary policy today.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997971653938293
Utilization rates in the labor market play a special role in the inflation process.,1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997813105583191
"That is, inflation is often initially transmitted from labor market excess demand to wage change and then to price change.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997954964637756
"This third principle may be especially important today because, in my view, there is an important disparity between the balance between supply and demand in the labor and product markets, with at least a hint of excess demand in labor markets, but very little to suggest such imbalance in product markets.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9998321533203125
"It is important to understand that the Phillips Curve is a model of inflation dynamics, not a model that determines the equilibrium inflation rate.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9998013377189636
"For this reason, the Phillips Curve paradigm is not at all inconsistent with the view that inflation is, in the long run, exclusively a monetary phenomenon.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997988343238831
"In other words, NAIRU is consistent with any constant rate of inflation, including zero.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997991919517517
The Phillips Curve therefore cannot determine inflation in the long run because it is consistent with any constant rate of inflation.,1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997714161872864
What does determine the rate of inflation in the long run?,1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997759461402893
"The rate of money growth, of course, though one needs to assume a stable money demand function to get a stable relationship between money growth and inflation.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997952580451965
"What does the Phillips Curve explain, if not the long-run level of inflation?",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997591376304626
"The answer is that it explains the dynamics of the inflation process, how the economy evolves from one inflation rate to another, for example, in response to an increase in the rate of money growth.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9998136162757874
The dynamics of changes in inflation operate through excess demand in labor and/or product markets.,1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997972846031189
"Thus the Phillips Curve indicates that, if the unemployment rate is maintained at a level below NAIRU, inflation increases over time, progressively and indefinitely.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.999743640422821
The initial source of an increase in inflation can be anything which produces excess demand in labor and output markets.,1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997896552085876
"It could also be a supply shock, but I am ignoring this possibility so I can focus exclusively on the implications of the current strength in aggregate demand.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997536540031433
"Under an interest rate operating procedure, an increase in aggregate demand which increases output, utilization rates, and, ultimately, inflation will itself generate an increase in the money supply to support the higher nominal income.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997997879981995
"Still, this relationship was about the most stable tool in the macroeconomists' tool kit for most of the past 20 years; those who were willing to depend on it were likely to be very successful forecasters of inflation, and the record speaks for itself on this score.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9998013377189636
"Nevertheless, the combination of the 7-year low in the unemployment rate and 30-year low in inflation was a surprise to those using this framework.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997699856758118
"But, it should also be noted that monetary policy has responded appropriately to this surprise.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997616410255432
"That is, monetary policy has been careful not to be tied rigidly to a constant estimate of NAIRU.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.999776303768158
"Instead, in my view, monetary policymakers have, in effect, implicitly adjusted their estimate of NAIRU to reflect the incoming data; this might be viewed as following a procedure like the time-varying parameter estimation technique applied by Robert Gordon and others.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9998334646224976
"In the short run, there are many factors, in addition to aggregate demand, that influence inflation – including changes in the minimum wage, shocks to food and oil prices unrelated to the balance between aggregate demand and supply in the U.S., changes in the exchange rate, and exogenous effects on health care costs, etc.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997939467430115
"One explanation for the better than expected performance of core inflation in relation to the unemployment rate focuses, for example, on a series of favorable supply shocks – including the slowdown in benefit costs and the decline in import prices – that traditionally are not incorporated in estimated Phillips Curves.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9998003840446472
"For example, the evidence suggests that changes in the demographic composition of the labor force affect NAIRU and it is also likely that government programs, including unemployment compensation and welfare, also affect NAIRU.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9998019337654114
"Clearly, one of the challenges of monetary policy is to set policy in the context of uncertainty about the precise value of NAIRU.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997674822807312
The second element in the analytical framework is the link from output growth to the level of excess demand.,1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997968077659607
The economy has a capacity to grow over time that is limited by the sum of the trend rate of growth in the labor force and the trend rate of growth in labor productivity.,1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997876286506653
"While both components can change over time and labor force and productivity growth are subject to both cyclical variation as well as secular shift, the historical record suggests that the trend rate of output growth changes very slowly over time.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9998157620429993
"Currently, the trend rate of labor force growth is near 1 percent per year (based on population growth and leaving, for later, the interpretation of the recent rise in the participation rate) and the trend rate of productivity growth is slightly above 1 percent per year (though there is more than the usual uncertainty about this estimate, in part due to conflicting indications in measures of productivity derived from the product and income sides of the national accounts), resulting in trend output growth in the 2-2½ percent range.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9998207688331604
"A key relationship is that when actual growth in output equals trend growth, utilization rates are constant; and when actual growth exceeds trend growth, utilization rates increase.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9998034834861755
"Now we can put the causal structure of the inflation process together, connecting up growth, unemployment rates, and inflation.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997890591621399
Growth above trend raises utilization rates.,1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997684359550476
Rising labor force utilization rates raise wage change relative to productivity growth.,1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997890591621399
An increase in wage change relative to productivity growth raises labor costs and an increase in labor costs results in higher price inflation.,1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997605681419373
Does growth cause inflation?,1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997612833976746
"Certainly, higher trend growth does not raise inflation.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997757077217102
"Indeed, an unexpected increase in trend productivity and hence trend growth in output would likely result in lower inflation for a while; if the rate of money growth were held constant, a permanent increase in productivity growth would result in a permanent decline in inflation.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9998006224632263
"Although above-trend growth in output does not directly cause inflation, to the extent it results in increases in utilization rates, after some point, sustained above-trend growth will result in higher inflation.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997426867485046
"First, we have to worry about whether there may have been a change in trend growth, for example, due to a rise in trend productivity growth or a change in the trend in labor force participation.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997968077659607
"If trend growth has increased, whether because of higher labor force growth or higher productivity growth, then we would observe that rapid growth does not raise utilization rates.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997866749763489
"If NAIRU is lower than we expect, then the current unemployment rate is less likely to be associated with excess demand in the labor market and therefore poses less risk of higher inflation.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997732043266296
"For example, it is important to confirm that utilization rates are rising before continuing very long to tighten policy to damp presumed above-trend growth.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997501969337463
This will prevent a persistent mistake in the face of an unexpected shift in the economy's trend rate of growth.,1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997778534889221
Monetary policy usually avoids this mistake by focusing on utilization rates and not growth.,1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997616410255432
"The second check is to confirm that, following a decline in the unemployment rate, wage change is moving higher, consistent with increased excess demand in the labor market.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.999800980091095
"In addition, we have to take into account temporary forces related to, for example, minimum wage, health care costs, and exchange rates.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997543692588806
"Finally, we have to make allowances for the dynamics of the process, including the tendency for inertia to result in only a very small initial increase in inflation once excess demand has developed and the tendency of the initial rise in wages in excess of productivity to be tempered by a decline in profit margins before leading to higher prices.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997760653495789
"Growth in the first quarter appears to have been at least as strong as the pace in the fourth quarter, and the economy seems to have solid momentum in the current quarter.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997958540916443

The unemployment rate which has fluctuated in a rather narrow band over the last year and a half has recently been inching lower and is now equal to its cyclical and 7-year low.,1997-04-24,TRUST,0.999782145023346
"I suspect that the unemployment rate is now below NAIRU, though the steady rise in wage change over the last year suggests that the unemployment rate may have been somewhat below NAIRU for a while.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9998039603233337

The net result is that output growth must slow from recent levels to prevent further increases in utilization rates.,1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997648596763611

Interpreting the Policy Action as Part of a Strategy for Monetary Policy Let me now interpret the tightening in relation to several descriptions of monetary policy strategy.,1997-04-24,TRUST,0.999818742275238
"The first three really are alternative perspectives on a single essential principle of prudent monetary policy, the importance of leaning against the wind by enforcing pro-cyclical movements in short-term interest rates.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9998019337654114
The fourth reflects one way in which monetary policy might take into account the uncertainty in the outlook.,1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9998053908348083
A Taylor Rule perspective I have noted in a number of previous speeches that I view the Taylor Rule as highlighting a couple of important requirements for prudent monetary policy.,1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997965693473816
"First, the Taylor Rule links Federal Reserve policy to a long-run inflation target and thus ensures that, in the long run, policy will force the actual inflation rate to converge to the long-run target.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997923970222473
The Taylor Rule thus imposes a powerful nominal anchor on monetary policy.,1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997603297233582
"Second, the Taylor Rule generally imposes a pro-cyclical pattern on real short-term interest rates, so that monetary policy leans against the cyclical winds and thereby stabilizes the economy, in much the same way that automatic stabilizers in our fiscal institutions, via cyclical swings in government budget deficits, damp business cycles.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9998067021369934
"According to the Taylor Rule, the federal funds rate should adjust over time to changes in utilization rates (the gap between actual and potential output or between the unemployment rate and NAIRU) and to changes in inflation.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997996687889099
"Because utilization rates had not increased (at least had not increased outside the range of the last year) and core inflation was actually lower in March compared with earlier, the Taylor Rule did not dictate a tightening.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997902512550354
"The Rule did suggest, however, that monetary policy would have had to tighten over time if the forecast of rising utilization rates and higher inflation proved correct.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9997584223747253
"The traditional specification is forward looking to a degree in relation to inflation, in that it sets the funds rate in relation to both the utilization rate (an advance warning of future increases in inflation) and to inflation.",1997-04-24,TRUST,0.9998204112052917

This rate--which is often called the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (or NAIRU)--is a fact of life outside the control of the FOMC.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997795224189758
This definition of full employment insures that the two objectives left for monetary policy--full employment and price stability--are compatible in the long run.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.999790608882904
"Fifth, inflation pressures arise, in large part, in response to departures of the economy from full employment.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997931122779846
"If the economy moves below full employment, for example, the resulting slack results in disinflation, that is, downward pressure on inflation.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997794032096863
When the economy moves above this threshold there is continuing upward pressure on inflation.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997263550758362
This implies that the two objectives of price stability and full employment can conflict in the short run.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997723698616028
This leaves us with dual objectives for monetary policy: short-run stabilization of output relative to potential and long-run price stability.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.999798595905304
"Fortunately, this is also the legislative mandate Congress has set for monetary policy in the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978, often referred to as the Humphrey-Hawkins Act, at least by my interpretation.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997937083244324
These include the definition of an inflation target that corresponds to price stability and the estimate of the unemployment threshold that corresponds to full employment.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.999795138835907
I'll assume that the inflation target is set to reflect the expected bias in inflation measurement or to be slightly above this estimate.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997950196266174
Many commentators view a 2% inflation rate as a reasonable inflation objective and many countries with explicit inflation targets use a 1% - 3% range.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.999794065952301
"As for the definition of full employment, I'll use a consensus estimate of the unemployment threshold, which is currently around 5½%.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997842907905579
"I might add that there is considerable uncertainty about this estimate, particularly in light of the consistent surprise of declining inflation even as the unemployment rate has fallen well below this threshold.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997844099998474
"I have focused a number of my speeches on this very topic, but, for today, it is mainly a reminder of the uncertainty that monetary policymakers face about the structure of the economy, especially when the structure changes over time.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998307228088379
Instruments The next step is to identify the instruments through which monetary policy influences the economy.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998030066490173
"While there are, in principle, three instruments through which monetary policy affects the macroeconomy--open market operations, the discount rate, and the reserve requirement ratio--as Alan Holmes certainly appreciated, open market operations are the principal instrument of monetary policy, and so I will focus on open market operations.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998169541358948
"When it purchases securities from the private sector, it injects reserves and normally puts downward pressure on short-term market interest rates.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997535347938538
So open market operations can be viewed as implementing either a path of reserves or achieving a level of short-term interest rates.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997966885566711
"In practice, nearly all central banks target a short-term interest rate rather than reserves with their open market operations.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997920393943787
"This is because reserves are most useful for close control of the money supply and money supplies have proven to have only a loose, long-term relationship to the objectives of monetary policy.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997883439064026
"Indeed, this lecture would be nearly over, because we would not have to worry about a strategy for monetary policy.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997547268867493
It is precisely because none of these preconditions hold that monetary policy is so difficult and principles are needed to guide its implementation.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997784495353699
"Third, monetary policy affects aggregate demand and inflation with a lag.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997949004173279
"Therefore, when we are thinking about affecting inflation, we better be thinking about affecting inflation next year, rather than tomorrow.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997484087944031
"If we want to affect inflation next year, we have to act today.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997046589851379
"Fortunately, theory and evidence suggest, as I noted earlier, that the objectives of full employment and price stability are consistent in the long run.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998193383216858
A conflict arises if we begin with inflation above our objective.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9996974468231201
"Unfortunately, monetary policy can reduce inflation only by temporarily imposing some slack in the economy.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997624754905701
"In this case, lowering inflation would mean departing for a while from full employment.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997683167457581
"Once inflation had fallen to its target level, the economy could return to full employment and enjoy the consistency of the two objectives.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997995495796204
"A second source of conflict arises in response to a supply shock, such as an increase in oil prices.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.99977046251297
Assume we begin with full employment and price stability and there is a sharp rise in oil prices.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997660517692566

"The natural hurdles make monetary policy a challenging task, requiring the application of both good judgment and appropriate models, art and science.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998006224632263

"As I noted earlier, monetary policy is implemented in the U.S., as in most of central banks, through the control of interest rates.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997981190681458
The federal funds rate is the interest rate on overnight loans in the inter-bank market.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997768998146057
"Point of Departure: Constant Money Growth Rule Given that the Federal Reserve, like most other central bank today, operates by setting a near-term interest rate target, my focus is on developing some guiding principles for setting the interest rate target, more precisely, for adjusting the interest rate target in response to changing economic conditions.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998212456703186
"I have found it useful to begin this search, perhaps surprisingly, by developing the properties of a constant money supply growth rule.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998089671134949
"This both helps to identify some of the essential properties of a monetary policy strategy, which will apply to interest rate targeting as well, and highlights the practical difficulties in carrying out monetary policy using money supply targets.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998200535774231
Another reason for starting with a monetary aggregate strategy is that monetary aggregates played a more significant role in the implementation of monetary policy during Holmes' service as Manager of the System Open Market Account.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998133778572083
"The directive to the Manager from the FOMC during this period was often specified in terms of maintaining or changing ""money market conditions"" (a code for the federal funds rate), unless growth in the monetary aggregates departed significantly from the midpoints of their specified ranges.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998188614845276
This gave money growth a more direct role in the conduct of policy than it has today.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.999758780002594
Let's now see why money growth might be a useful target for implementing monetary policy.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997990727424622
"Economic theory suggests that, if the demand for money is stable, the rate of money growth will pin down the rate of growth in nominal income.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997730851173401
"Under reasonable assumptions, a constant rate of money growth will yield growth of nominal income, on average, at the same rate.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997953772544861
The rate of money growth should be set to achieve a rate of nominal income growth that just equals the rate of trend growth in real output and the rate of inflation consistent with the policy objective.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.99979168176651
"On average and in the long run, this rate of money growth will achieve the Fed's inflation objective.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997933506965637
So the first proposition is that a money growth target provides a nominal anchor which pins down the long-run inflation rate.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998028874397278
This strategy immediately allows a translation of the long-run price stability objective into a more near-term money supply growth target.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997971653938293
"And, by implication, any monetary policy strategy must mimic the nominal anchor property of a money supply target, if it is to be consistent with the Federal Reserve's mandate for price stability.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997894167900085
"Next, let's ask what would happen if the economy was subject to a shock that moved it away from price stability and full employment.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997847676277161
"If real output increases faster than trend and/or inflation increases relative to the Fed's objective, the resulting higher nominal income growth, relative to the constant rate of money growth, would result in an increase in interest rates.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997751116752625
The second property of a money supply target is that it builds stability into the economy by insuring pro-cyclical movements in the interest rate in response to demand shocks.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997957348823547
Another way of saying this is that it insures that monetary policy automatically leans against the cyclical winds to stabilize the economy.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997846484184265
"The Taylor Rule as a Strategy for an Interest Rate Operating Procedure Despite the desirable properties of a constant money growth rule, in principle, most central banks implement policy by setting short-term interest rates in practice.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998106360435486
"First, instability in money demand reduces the usefulness of money supply targets.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997881054878235
"Second, interest rate targets allow the central bank to smooth out the effects of transitory shocks to financial markets.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997921586036682
"But how should the Fed vary its interest rate ""instrument"" to achieve its ultimate objectives?",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997808337211609
The simplest answer is that interest rates should vary to imitate qualitatively the way they would behave if the Fed were implementing a money supply target.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998130202293396
"In other words, interest rates need to be varied systematically to effectively impose a nominal anchor and to insure that policy leans against the cyclical winds.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.999790608882904
"Setting monetary policy in this manner via an interest rate target, in principle, allows the Fed to achieve the best of both worlds.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998072981834412
"It can impose the same nominal anchor and short-run stabilization properties as would be the case with a money growth rule, but, at the same time, smooth out shorter-run volatility in interest rates.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998065829277039
"In addition, by careful choice of the degree of response of interest rates to changing economic conditions, the rule can, in principle, improve upon the stabilization properties of a money supply rule.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998008608818054
The appeal of the Taylor Rule is that it is simple and specifies how the federal funds rate (effectively the Fed's instrument) should be varied directly in response to inflation and to deviations of output and inflation from the Fed's ultimate targets of full employment and price stability.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998094439506531
It is useful to appreciate how Taylor derived his rule and how he views its role in monetary policy.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998134970664978
The Taylor Rule begins by assuming that there is some level of real federal funds rate consistent with full employment and stable inflation.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998074173927307
The real interest rate is the nominal interest rate less some measure of inflation expectations (measured by Taylor as actual inflation over the last year)--a measure of the increase in purchasing power (rather than in dollars) associated with holding an asset.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998002648353577
Taylor calls this the equilibrium real interest rate and assumed it was 2%.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997796416282654
Let's assume that the economy is initially at full employment and price stability.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997796416282654
Then the level of real and nominal interest rates would be set at 2%.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997498393058777
"The economy is, of course, not always at full employment and price stability and the purpose of the Taylor Rule is to specify how the federal funds rate should respond to shocks that push the economy away from price stability and/or full employment.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998015761375427
"Because both objectives are explicitly incorporated into the rule, it provides a disciplined approach to juggling the dual mandate for monetary policy.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998111128807068
The real equilibrium interest rate is viewed as consistent with full employment and any stable rate of inflation.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997933506965637
"So the first implication of this rule is that, in order to be consistent with full employment, nominal interest rates should be adjusted in response to inflation to maintain the equilibrium real interest rate.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998087286949158
The next message of the rule concerns how the real federal funds rate should be adjusted in response to deviations of output and inflation from full employment and price stability.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998088479042053
"According to the rule, when output rises relative to potential output, real interest rates should rise.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997748732566833
"When inflation rises relative to the inflation target, real interest rates should also rise.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997588992118835
These movements of real interest rates in response to departures of inflation and output from their target levels can be shown to stabilize output and inflation relative to their targets.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998036026954651
"The Dangers of an Interest Rate Strategy There are natural dangers inherent in interest rate targeting, at least in the absence of a rule that guides its adjustment to changing economic conditions.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997753500938416
"If cyclical movements in output are dominated by demand shocks, the failure to move interest rates aggressively enough in response to the shocks can result in monetary policy destabilizing rather than stabilizing the economy.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997573494911194
"For example, if there is a demand shock resulting in higher income and/or prices, the demand for money will increase, putting upward pressure on interest rates.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997289776802063
"If the Fed maintains an unchanged nominal interest rate target, it will have to add reserves to support a higher money supply at the initial interest rate.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997656941413879
"This means that, under a constant interest rate target, a demand shock would lead to perverse monetary policy, specifically to stimulative open market operations, reinforcing rather than damping the demand shock.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997221827507019
The inherent danger in interest rate targeting is reinforced by the preference for central bankers for smoothing interest rates.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.999742329120636
"Nevertheless, interest rate targets can, in principle, be implemented in a way that avoids this pitfall, and one of the values of rules is to remind policymakers of the importance of adjusting interest rates in response to changing economic conditions, thereby preventing policy from becoming destabilizing.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997826218605042
Principles to Guide the Setting of Interest Rates We are now ready to identify a set of principles to guide decisions about the setting of the federal funds rate at FOMC meetings.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997897744178772
Underlying these principles are the lessons gleaned from both the constant money growth rule and from the Taylor Rule.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.999808132648468
Both rules highlight the importance of imposing a nominal anchor to pin down the long-run inflation rate and of varying real interest rates pro-cyclically to lean against the cyclical winds.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998226761817932
The Taylor Rule also highlights the critical importance of real interest rates in the conduct of monetary policy.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997969269752502
There is one very important difference between the constant money growth and Taylor rules that deserves comment.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997844099998474
"While a constant rate of money growth will not always be optimal, if money demand is sufficiently stable, and not particularly interest sensitive, it will pin down inflation in the long run and help smooth the business cycle in the short run.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998067021369934
"That is, under a money growth target, doing nothing (that is, maintaining an unchanged rate of money growth) may not always be the best choice, but, for the most part, it won't get you into serious trouble and will in fact do some considerable good, although it would likely involve a considerable variation in interest rates on a day-to-day basis.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998120665550232
"Under an interest rate targeting regime, on the other hand, doing nothing can potentially get you into great difficulty--sometimes quite quickly.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997039437294006
Rule # 1: Vary real interest rates in response to departures of inflation from its target.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998008608818054
"For example, if inflation increases, relative to its target, the real interest rate should be increased.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.999734103679657
This is perhaps the single most important discipline for monetary policy under an interest rate regime.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997745156288147
"When inflation increases, nominal interest rates must first be increased just to avoid a decline in the real rate.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997633099555969
"But to counter the rise in inflation relative to its target, the real interest rate has to rise.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997522234916687
That means that nominal rates have to rise by more than the increase in inflation.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997454285621643
"In the Taylor Rule, for example, the nominal federal funds rate rises by 1.5 percentage points for every one percentage-point increase in inflation.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997407793998718
Rule # 2: Vary (nominal and real) interest rates in response to changes in resource utilization rates.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.999800980091095
"Under a money supply growth rule, interest rates rise whenever growth in real GDP exceeds the trend GDP growth assumption embedded in the money growth target.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997723698616028
"Whenever growth is above trend, the unemployment rate falls and the capacity utilization rate rises.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997923970222473
"By adjusting real interest rates in response to such changes in utilization rates, for a given inflation rate, an interest rate regime insures the same qualitative stabilization property that a constant money growth rule automatically yields.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998071789741516
"In implementing this principle, real interest rates would rise gradually but systematically during expansions, fall when growth slows to below trend, and decline sharply when the actual level of output declines, at least for those cyclical episodes where supply shocks (see below) are not very important.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998218417167664
Just following this simple principle will help stabilize output relative to full employment and inflation relative to the inflation target.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998020529747009
"I believe monetary policy has, in fact, been excellent over this period.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.999756395816803
It should not lull us into believing that stable interest rates and good monetary policy naturally go together.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997596144676208
"I noted earlier that, because of lags, monetary policy has to be forward looking.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998047947883606
"For example, because higher utilization rates today raise the risk of higher inflation in the future, raising interest rates today in response to observed increases in utilization rates is a forward-looking policy relative to simply responding to current inflation.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997578263282776
A movement in interest rates in response to rising utilization rates would be said to be a preemptive move against inflation.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997803568840027
"The Taylor Rule thus allows for a combination of preemptive policy, changes in interest rates in response to changes in utilization rates, and reactive policy, changes in interest rates in response to movements in inflation itself.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998188614845276
"A still more forward-looking approach would be for policymakers to respond not to actual inflation and utilization rates, as in the Taylor Rule, but to forecasts of projected inflation and utilization rates, assuming an unchanged nominal federal funds rate.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998087286949158
A good reason for responding to forecasts of inflation is that the effects of monetary policy on the economy mostly occur about a year from now.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998067021369934
There is a considerable amount of work under way to assess the usefulness of using forecasts as opposed to past information on unemployment and inflation in the specification of interest rate rules.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.999795138835907
Judgement is especially called for in situations where special events point to future changes in output and inflation that would ordinarily be viewed as unlikely.,1998-03-16,TRUST,0.999783456325531
"This momentum reflected persistent strength in domestic demand, particularly consumer spending and business fixed investment.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998028874397278
"In this environment, a backward-looking policy that ignored the potential drag on future demand from Asia could risk magnifying the effect of the shift in aggregate demand.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.999739944934845
"The first is a persistent demand shock--for example, an increase in aggregate demand that results in a persistent departure from trend growth and persistent changes in utilization rates.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997933506965637
"This will have symmetric effects, raising both output and inflation, and presents a relatively straightforward monetary policy problem that is well handled by the first set of rules.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9998001456260681
"A second source of shock is a supply shock, an example of which would be a one-time, permanent increase in oil prices.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997712969779968
"We have had several examples of very sharp increases in oil prices, especially in the 1970s, and, more recently, oil prices have been declining since the end of 1996.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997926354408264
"When there is a sharp rise in oil prices, there will be a temporary burst of inflation.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997536540031433
"In addition, an adverse supply shock will typically result in a decline in aggregate demand and hence in output and employment.",1998-03-16,TRUST,0.9997609257698059

"Theoretical Pros and Cons From a theoretical perspective, one might think that inflation targets would be most valuable to countries with a history of bad inflation.",2000-01-13,TRUST,0.9997804760932922
One is to peg their exchange rate to some hard currency and essentially tie the hands of their central bank.,2000-01-13,TRUST,0.9997324347496033
The second route is to adopt an inflation target and to stick to it.,2000-01-13,TRUST,0.9997650980949402
"If the prior inflation is very bad, as it often is in emerging-market countries, these targets might have to start at a high level and be worked gradually down as the central bank brings inflation under control.",2000-01-13,TRUST,0.9997435212135315
"Although inflation targeting is usually described as an antidote to past inflationary binges, it has also been suggested as a cure to potential deflation.",2000-01-13,TRUST,0.9997780919075012
"Krugman (1998), for example, has argued that Japan, with nominal interest rates stuck at their floor of zero, can lower real interest rates and stimulate investment by having the Bank of Japan target a positive rate of inflation and do what it can to hit that target.",2000-01-13,TRUST,0.9997876286506653
Inflation-targeting regimes might also work well when a country undergoes what is known as a productivity shock.,2000-01-13,TRUST,0.9997761845588684
"Suppose a wave of innovations makes productivity rise, pushing up output and lowering unit labor costs.",2000-01-13,TRUST,0.999772846698761
"For a time this shock might be reflected in higher-than-trend rates of growth of output and lower-than-trend rates of unemployment, making it difficult to rely on normal indicators of demand and supply growth in the conduct of monetary policy.",2000-01-13,TRUST,0.9997434020042419
"In such circumstances, a cautious central bank might well just wait for signs of inflation to emerge, thwart the inflation if it occurs, and not rely as heavily on normal measures of aggregate demand growth or labor market tightness.",2000-01-13,TRUST,0.999754011631012
"Such a central bank would, in effect, be following an inflation-targeting regime.",2000-01-13,TRUST,0.9997660517692566
"Although liberals in general have been very critical of inflation targeting (Galbraith, 1999), in this case inflation targeting would lead to exactly the type of monetary policy they would favor.",2000-01-13,TRUST,0.9997871518135071
"But in some cases, inflation targeting might not work out so well.",2000-01-13,TRUST,0.9997161030769348
Suppose there were a recessionary shock to aggregate demand.,2000-01-13,TRUST,0.9997394680976868
"Because inflation normally responds slowly to such shocks, inflation targeters could respond in any of three ways.",2000-01-13,TRUST,0.9998056292533875
"Strict inflation targeters, sometimes snidely called inflation nutters, might sit idly by and let the recession happen.",2000-01-13,TRUST,0.9996848106384277
"Or, if inflation fell below target ranges, some central banks might take steps to boost inflation by expansionary monetary policy.",2000-01-13,TRUST,0.9997366070747375
"They would clearly do this if deflation threatened, but they might do it even with low positive rates of inflation below target ranges.",2000-01-13,TRUST,0.9997265934944153
The third possible response involves flexible and forward-looking inflation targeting as is actually practiced in most countries.,2000-01-13,TRUST,0.9998243451118469
"Because inflation usually responds slowly to output changes in recessions, flexible inflation-targeting regimes would be free to ease policy to stabilize output, much as would non-targeting central banks.",2000-01-13,TRUST,0.9998145699501038
Forward-looking central banks could even act affirmatively against recessions to prevent future inflation from falling below its target range.,2000-01-13,TRUST,0.999747097492218
But even here the flexibility to be forward-looking and to pursue other goals is less than a commitment of the central bank to try to stabilize output or promote full employment.,2000-01-13,TRUST,0.9997479319572449
"The exact importance of these other objectives remains in question, even for flexible and forward-looking inflation-targeting regimes.",2000-01-13,TRUST,0.999749481678009
"Other instances in which inflation targeting might not work so well are negative supply shocks, such as most economies experienced in the mid-1970s when oil prices exploded.",2000-01-13,TRUST,0.9997556805610657
"In these times, inflation rises just as output falls.",2000-01-13,TRUST,0.9997709393501282
The most flexible and competent central bank in the world would be faced with a difficult dilemma in such circumstances--forestall the recession by making inflation worse or limit the inflation by making the recession worse.,2000-01-13,TRUST,0.9997507929801941
"In general, an inflation-targeting central bank would not have much of a choice.",2000-01-13,TRUST,0.9997832179069519
"It would be forced to try to limit the inflation by contractionary policies, hence making the recession worse.",2000-01-13,TRUST,0.9997132420539856
"Even a flexible, forward-looking inflation-targeting central bank would not have much freedom in such a situation, because in the end the central bank would be evaluated much more on its success in meeting inflation targets than in meeting output growth targets.",2000-01-13,TRUST,0.9997488856315613
"Hence, inflation targeting does not appear to solve all the problems central banks might face and cannot be prescribed as a panacea.",2000-01-13,TRUST,0.9997492432594299
"It still might be a reasonable policy strategy for most purposes, and it still seems to be generally the proper approach for dealing with histories of inflation or deflation and, perhaps, with productivity shocks.",2000-01-13,TRUST,0.9998156428337097

"Despite the fact that inflation had dropped in all three countries before the adoption of inflation targeting, these authors observed upward inflationary blips in New Zealand and Canada; so perhaps the achievement of keeping inflation under control should not be taken for granted.",2000-01-13,TRUST,0.9995946288108826
"Their results were buttressed by those of Kuttner and Posen (1999), whose VAR regressions for the United Kingdom found that inflation persistence was reduced by inflation targeting, as measured by inflation itself and by nominal interest rates.",2000-01-13,TRUST,0.9998263716697693

"1 Car and Driver: A Misleading Analogy Eight times each year the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets to set U.S. monetary policy--which, under current operating procedures, amounts to choosing a target for the federal funds rate, a short-term interest rate that the Federal Reserve influences by controlling the supply of bank reserves.",2004-12-02,TRUST,0.9997982382774353

"Making Monetary Policy: Two Candidate Frameworks The two frameworks for monetary policymaking I will compare today are generally referred to in the recent economics literature as instrument rules and targeting rules (Svensson, 2003; McCallum and Nelson, 2004; Svensson, 2004b).",2004-12-02,TRUST,0.9998176693916321

"Under a simple feedback policy, the central bank's policy instrument--the federal funds rate in the United States--is closely linked to the behavior of a relatively small number of macroeconomic variables, variables that either are directly observable (such as employment or inflation) or can be estimated from current information (such as the economy's full-employment level of output).",2004-12-02,TRUST,0.9997912049293518

In its most basic version the Taylor rule is an equation that relates the current setting of the federal funds rate to two variables: the level of the output gap (the deviation of output from its full-employment level) and the difference between the inflation rate and the policy committee's preferred inflation rate.,2004-12-02,TRUST,0.999803364276886
"Like most feedback policies, the Taylor rule instructs policymakers to ""lean against the wind""; for example, when output is above its potential or inflation is above the target, the Taylor rule implies that the federal funds rate should be set above its average level, which (all else being equal) should slow the economy and bring output or inflation back toward the desired range.4 Numerous simple feedback policies other than those based on the Taylor rule have been proposed and analyzed.5 How does the use of simple feedback policies address the issues I raised earlier--namely, the problem of limited information and the need to account for private-sector expectations when making policy?",2004-12-02,TRUST,0.9998255372047424

"To reiterate, however, the policy framework espoused by Chairman Greenspan is very much a forecast-based approach; indeed, because it requires making judgments about unlikely as well as likely economic outcomes, it places greater demands on our ability to forecast and to assess risks than do simpler forecast-based approaches that focus on average outcomes only.",2004-12-02,TRUST,0.9998303651809692

A widening of the spread between the ten-year nominal and ten-year indexed securities is not itself surprising; part of that widening is accounted for by the increase in short-term inflation expectations.,2004-06-04,TRUST,0.9997944235801697

The very accommodative stance of policy--including both the low level of the funds rate and the FOMC's indications that it was intending to hold it at that level for a while--was put in place to counter unusually weak demand and declining inflation.,2004-06-04,TRUST,0.9998012185096741
The challenge we face is to remove the accommodation in such a way as to foster both the return to full employment and the maintenance of price stability.,2004-06-04,TRUST,0.9997506737709045
"Because I believe that the rise in inflation will be limited and because I agree that growth of output is likely to only moderately exceed the growth of the economy's potential, I supported the FOMC's assessment at its last meeting that accommodation likely can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.",2004-06-04,TRUST,0.999778687953949

"Under a strict rules-based approach to monetary policy, advocated most prominently by Milton Friedman and his followers, the policy instruments of the central bank would be set according to some simple and publicly announced formula, with little or no scope for modification or discretionary action on the part of policymakers.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9997325539588928
"Friedman believed that such a rule would have the important advantage of preventing major monetary policy errors, as when the Federal Reserve permitted the U.S. money supply to collapse in the 1930s--a blunder that contributed substantially to the severity of the Great Depression.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9997565150260925
"In addition, Friedman argued, a rule of this type would have the advantages of simplicity, predictability, and credibility, and it would help insulate monetary policy from outside political pressures and what Friedman saw as an inherent tendency toward excessive policy activism.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9997308850288391

"Although the gold standard system malfunctioned and ultimately collapsed during the chaotic economic and financial conditions that followed World War I, many economic historians have credited it with promoting price stability and robust international trade and capital flows during 1870-1913, the so-called classical gold standard era.1 Another example of a rule-like monetary policy institution is a currency board, such as the ones currently employed by Hong Kong and several eastern European nations.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9998076558113098
"On the other side of the debate, advocates of discretion have firmly rejected the use of strict rules for policy, arguing that central bankers must be left free to set monetary policy as they see fit, based on their best judgment and the use of all relevant information.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9997491240501404
"Supporters of discretion contend that policy rules of the type advocated by Friedman are simply too mechanical and inflexible for use in real world policymaking; in particular, simple rules cannot fully accommodate special circumstances or unanticipated events.2 During the past few decades, for example, financial innovation and new transactions technologies have led to large and difficult-to-predict changes in the empirical relationship between money growth and the rates of growth of output and prices.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9997716546058655
"If central banks had slavishly followed Friedman's k-percent rule for money growth during this period, critics point out, substantial economic instability would have been the likely result; indeed, most central banks have de-emphasized money growth as a policy target or indicator in recent years.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9988530874252319
"Although a strict rules-based framework for monetary policy has evident drawbacks, notably its inflexibility in the face of unanticipated developments, supporters of rules in their turn have pointed out--with considerable justification--that the record of monetary policy under unfettered discretion is nothing to crow about.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9997350573539734
"In the United States, the heyday of discretionary monetary policy can be dated as beginning in the early 1960s, a period of what now appears to have been substantial over-optimism about the ability of policymakers to ""fine-tune"" the economy.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9997667670249939
"Contrary to the expectation of that era's economists and policymakers, however, the subsequent two decades were characterized not by an efficiently managed, smoothly running economic machine but by high and variable inflation and an unstable real economy, culminating in the deep 1981-82 recession.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9966661334037781
"Although a number of factors contributed to the poor economic performance of this period, I think most economists would agree that the deficiencies of a purely discretionary approach to monetary policy--including over-optimism about the ability of policy to fine-tune the economy, low credibility, vulnerability to political pressures, short policy horizons, and insufficient appreciation of the costs of high inflation--played a central role.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9988287091255188
"My thesis today is that there is such a middle ground--an approach that I will refer to as constrained discretion--and that it is fast becoming the standard approach to monetary policy around the world, including in the United States.4 As I will explain, constrained discretion is an approach that allows monetary policymakers considerable leeway in responding to economic shocks, financial disturbances, and other unforeseen developments.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9998262524604797

"In practice, I will argue, this approach has allowed central banks to achieve better outcomes in terms of both inflation and unemployment, confounding the traditional view that policymakers must necessarily trade off between the important social goals of price stability and high employment.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9996870756149292
"I will then explain why I think constrained discretion is the best operating framework for monetary policy, and in particular why it constitutes the best approach for achieving the economic goals that the Congress has set for the Fed.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9997640252113342
"Finally, I will briefly discuss the close relationship between constrained discretion and the strategy for monetary policy known as inflation targeting.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9998311996459961
The approach to monetary policy that I call constrained discretion can be defined by two simple and parsimonious principles.,2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9998056292533875
"First, through its words and (especially) its actions, the central bank must establish a strong commitment to keeping inflation low and stable.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9997573494911194
"Second, subject to the condition that inflation be kept low and stable, and to the extent possible given our uncertainties about the structure of the economy and the effects of policy, monetary policy should strive to limit cyclical swings in resource utilization.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9997946619987488
"In short, under constrained discretion, the central bank is free to do its best to stabilize output and employment in the face of short-run disturbances, with the appropriate caution born of our imperfect knowledge of the economy and of the effects of policy.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9997994303703308
"However, a critical proviso is that, in conducting stabilization policy, the central bank must also maintain a strong commitment to keeping inflation--and, hence, public expectations of inflation--firmly under control.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9997668862342834
"Because monetary policy influences inflation with a lag, keeping inflation under control may sometimes require the central bank to anticipate and move in advance of inflationary developments--that is, to engage in ""preemptive strikes"" on inflation.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9997745156288147
"In my view, constrained discretion characterizes the current monetary policy framework of the United States.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9997829794883728
"First, since the Fed under Chairman Paul Volcker broke the back of inflation in the early 1980s, inflation in the United States has been both declining and becoming more stable.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9997583031654358
"From a high of nearly 10 percent in 1980, inflation (as measured by the core PCE deflator, twelve-month rate of change) fell to 4 percent by the end of 1984 and to 3 percent by the end of 1992.5 Inflation breached the 2 percent barrier in the spring of 1996 and has remained consistently within the narrow range of 1.5 to 2 percent for the past six and a half years--for practical purposes, a good approximation to price stability.6 Likewise, expected inflation--as measured by financial-market indicators as well as surveys of both professional forecasters and consumers--has stabilized at a low level.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9998212456703186

"Moreover, both output and employment have become considerably more stable in the past twenty years, relative to previous decades--a result I attribute in substantial part to improvements in monetary policy.7 The Fed has also responded aggressively and flexibly to crisis conditions in financial markets, in episodes ranging from the 1987 stock market crash to the 1998 Russian crisis to the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9994623064994812

"In a similar vein, as economist Martin Feldstein has frequently pointed out, price stability permits contracts, tax laws, accounting rules, and the like to be expressed in nominal (dollar) terms without concern about fluctuations in the value of money.8 If prices are instead variable and unpredictable, then contracts or laws written in dollar terms will produce unintended and probably undesired economic outcomes.9 Feldstein, for example, has emphasized how the interaction of inflation with the tax code leads to unintended increases in the real cost of capital, which inhibit investment and reduce economic growth.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9997507929801941

"For example, the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s, which cost U.S. taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars, was to a substantial extent the result of the unexpected inflation of the 1970s, which greatly reduced the real value of mortgage loans made by the S&Ls in an earlier, low-inflation era.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9997608065605164

"Yet another miscalculation, particularly important in the early stages of the Great Inflation, was the already-mentioned idea of an exploitable long-run tradeoff, according to which policymakers supposedly would be able to achieve permanently lower unemployment by accepting a bit more inflation.11 Indeed, initially the tradeoff idea appeared to be valid, for unemployment fell while inflation rose only moderately during the latter part of the 1960s.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9997859597206116

"Because inflation and inflation expectations remained stubbornly high when the Fed tightened, the impact of rising interest rates was felt primarily on output and employment rather than on prices, which continued to rise.12 One indication of the loss of credibility suffered by the Fed by the time of the 1981-82 episode, and the difficulty of getting it back once lost, was the behavior of long-term nominal interest rates.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9996119141578674

"Comparison of the 1970s and the 1990s confirms the common finding in the literature that the degree of ""pass-through"" to core inflation from supply shocks, such as a rise in oil prices or a depreciation of the exchange rate, depends strongly on how well domestic expectations of inflation are anchored.14 Because inflation expectations were not well anchored in the 1970s, the oil price shocks were in fact associated with substantial pass-through, that is, increases in core inflation.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9998086094856262

Constrained discretion and inflation targeting I mentioned at the beginning of the talk that constrained discretion characterizes at least to some degree the policy approach of many of the major central banks around the world.,2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9998277425765991
"It is, in fact, closely related to the policy framework known as inflation targeting.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9998192191123962
"Let me take a moment to explain the relationship between what I have termed ""constrained discretion"" and the more familiar concept of inflation targeting.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9998161196708679
"It is useful, I think, to divide monetary policymaking into two parts--roughly, what you do and what you say about it.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9998038411140442
The details of inflation-targeting regimes vary by country and have evolved over time.,2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9997938275337219
"Broadly speaking, however, the operational, or ""what you do,"" side of what I consider to be best-practice inflation targeting is well described as constrained discretion, as I have characterized it here.15 Specifically, most inflation-targeting central banks try to stabilize output and employment subject to the constraint that inflation remain low and stable--in the case of formal inflation targeters, of course, within the declared target range for inflation.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9998173117637634
"As I have noted, constrained discretion also describes reasonably well the recent policy approach of the Federal Reserve, though of course the Fed does not have publicly announced inflation targets.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9998279809951782
"Thus, on the operational side, the policy frameworks of the Federal Reserve and of the leading central banks with formal inflation targets are today rather similar.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.999821126461029
"The second element of inflation targeting--the communication, or ""what you say,"" side--consists of not only a public announcement of a target range for inflation (the hallmark of inflation targeting) but also a variety of other mechanisms for talking to markets and the public.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.999819815158844
"These include the regular publication of so-called Inflation Reports, release of forecasts, prompt release of minutes, and other measures.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9997798800468445
"Here is the principal area in which the Federal Reserve--though it has certainly become markedly more transparent in the past decade--has not chosen to adopt the whole framework of inflation targeting.16 Many have concluded that central banks that have adopted the transparency and communication aspects of inflation targeting have strengthened their overall policy performance--through enhanced communication to the public of their objectives and plans, improved management of expectations, greater consistency of policy, and heightened accountability.17 The Fed has much in common with other major central banks, but of course it also differs in important ways, including its history, legal framework, and institutional structure.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9988008737564087
Conclusion My objective today has been to lay out the advantages of using a framework of constrained discretion for making monetary policy.,2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9998194575309753
The essence of constrained discretion is the central role of a commitment to price stability.,2003-02-03,TRUST,0.999771773815155
"Not only does such a commitment enhance efficiency, employment, and economic growth in the long run, but--by providing an anchor for inflation expectations--it also improves the ability of central banks to stabilize the real economy in the short run as well.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.999769389629364
"An important and interesting implication is that, under a properly designed and implemented monetary policy regime, the key social objectives of price stability and maximum employment tend to be mutually reinforcing rather than competing goals.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9997935891151428
"To the best of my knowledge, this term was first used in connection with monetary policy by Bernanke and Mishkin (1997).",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9998020529747009
Throughout this talk I follow a common Fed practice in using the core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) deflator to measure inflation.,2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9998111128807068
"Relative to the more familiar consumer price index (CPI), the PCE deflator (1) has broader coverage, (2) is believed to be based on more accurate expenditure weights, (3) is constructed in a manner that reduces so-called substitution bias, (4) is measured more consistently over time, and (5) arguably does a better job measuring medical inflation.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9998070597648621
"The core PCE deflator excludes volatile components, notably the prices of food and energy.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9997785687446594
"Core inflation measures in general are probably better indicators of the underlying rate of inflation, with which central banks are typically most concerned.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9997929930686951
Standard inflation measures probably overstate increases in true inflation by about 1.0 percentage point.,2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9997690320014954
"For example, Lebow and Rudd (2002) estimate that measured inflation using the consumer price index overstates the actual change in the cost of living by about 0.9 percentage points per year, with a confidence interval ranging from 0.3 percentage point to l.4 percentage points per year.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9997695088386536
"In addition, as I discussed in a previous talk, aiming for an inflation rate modestly above zero provides a useful buffer against deflation risk.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9997852444648743
Stock and Watson (2002) note that the standard deviation of annual growth rates in real GDP fell from 2.7 percent during 1960-83 to only 1.6 percent in 1984-2001.,2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9997990727424622
They attribute 20 to 30 percent of this reduction in volatility to improvements in monetary policy.,2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9997681975364685
"At the broadest level, globalization influences the conduct of monetary policy through its powerful effects on the economic and financial environment in which monetary policy must operate.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9998070597648621

"Other than by contributing to general economic and financial stability, monetary policy can do little to affect these structural changes or the powerful economic forces that drive them.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9997721314430237
"However, to make effective policy, the Federal Reserve must have as full an understanding as possible of the factors determining economic growth, employment, and inflation in the U.S. economy, whether those influences originate at home or abroad.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9997878670692444
"A narrower question, but one that is critical for monetary policy makers, is whether the increased openness of the U.S. economy has in some way affected the ability of the Federal Reserve to meet its congressional mandate to foster price stability and maximum sustainable employment.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9998106360435486
"On this issue, some analysts have argued that globalization hinders monetary policy--for example, by reducing the ability of the Federal Reserve to affect U.S. interest rates and asset prices or by diminishing the role of domestic factors in the inflation process.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9997754693031311
You will not be surprised to hear that the Federal Reserve System is quite interested in the implications of globalization for the conduct and effectiveness of monetary policy.,2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9998015761375427
"The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas has created a Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute, which will support the study of globalizationâ€™s effects on policy and the economy, and a number of other Reserve Banks have undertaken similar efforts.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9997815489768982
In the remainder of my talk I will discuss two channels through which globalization may have affected the transmission and effectiveness of U.S. monetary policy.,2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9998183846473694
"First, I will consider whether the globalization of finance has weakened or otherwise affected the ability of U.S. monetary policy to influence domestic financial market conditions.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9997997879981995
"Second, I will discuss what we know about the way international factors influence the determination of inflation, a key goal variable for monetary policy.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9998111128807068
"Globalization, Monetary Policy, and Financial MarketsMonetary policy works in the first instance by affecting financial conditions, including the levels of interest rates and asset prices.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9998076558113098
Does financial globalization significantly reduce the influence of the Federal Reserve on financial conditions in the United States and thereby possibly make U.S. monetary policy less effective?,2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9997432827949524
"Certainly, the financial environment in which U.S. monetary policy is made has been irrevocably changed by the remarkable increases in the magnitudes of financial flows into and out of the United States.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9997801184654236
"Given their scale, capital inflows and outflows certainly influence long-term U.S. interest rates and other key asset prices, both by affecting the underlying supply-demand balance between saving and capital investment and by helping to determine the premiums that investors receive for holding assets that are risky or illiquid.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9998216032981873
How does all this affect monetary policy?,2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9997890591621399
It is helpful to think about the potential implications of globalized financial markets for monetary policy by beginning with the first stages of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.,2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9997923970222473
"In particular, as you know, the Federal Reserve influences financial conditions through its ability to control the federal funds rate, the interest rate at which banks lend to each other overnight.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9997922778129578
"Although the federal funds rate does not itself have a major influence on economic activity, other short-term rates--such as Eurodollar rates--are determined largely by the current and expected future values of the funds rate, reflecting the close substitutability of alternative short-term sources of funding.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9998137354850769
"The Federal Reserveâ€™s ability to control the federal funds rate thus gives it a strong influence over other short-term dollar nominal interest rates and, to the extent that inflation is inertial or sticky in the short run, over short-term real interest rates as well.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9997828602790833
"The Fedâ€™s ability to set the short-term interest rate independently of foreign financial conditions depends critically, of course, on the fact that the dollar is a freely floating currency whose value is continuously determined in open, competitive markets.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9997894167900085
"Because the dollar is free to adjust, U.S. interest rates can differ from rates abroad, and, consequently, the Fed retains the autonomy to set its federal funds rate target as needed to respond to domestic economic conditions.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9998113512992859
"Short-term interest rates affect the domestic economy through a number of channels (for example, by affecting the cost of holding inventories), so monetary policy could influence economic activity to some degree even if its control were limited to the short end of the yield curve.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.999811589717865
"Nevertheless, the ability to influence longer-term interest rates and the prices of longer-term assets is an important component of the Fedâ€™s toolkit for managing aggregate demand.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9997832179069519
The behavior of long-term interest rates over the past few years is a case in point.,2007-03-02,TRUST,0.999775230884552
"Compared with historical averages, long-term nominal interest rates have remained relatively low in recent years--the phenomenon that the previous Chairman, Alan Greenspan, termed a â€œconundrumâ€--even as the Federal Reserve was withdrawing monetary accommodation by raising the target for the federal funds rate by more than 400 basis points.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9997156262397766
"For example, strong foreign demand for U.S. long-term debt has been one factor tending to reduce the term premium, the extra return that investors demand to hold longer-term bonds.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9997778534889221
"All else equal, a smaller term premium implies a lower level of long-term interest rates.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9997702240943909
"At the same time, increases in the net supply of saving in global capital markets--which, to a significant extent, are a product of the large current account surpluses of some emerging-market economies and of oil-producing nations--have resulted in lower real long-term interest rates both in the United States and abroad.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9998090863227844
"Clearly, to understand and evaluate the behavior of the term structure and to assess the implications of current yields for the domestic economy, the Fed must take into account the various effects of foreign capital flows on U.S. yields and asset prices, a task that can be quite challenging.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9998118281364441
One statistical indicator of that interdependence is that the correlations between long-term interest rates in the United States and those in other industrial countries are high and appear to have risen significantly in the last few years.,2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9997932314872742
That interdependence suggests that monetary policy makers must pay attention to conditions abroad as well as at home.,2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9997671246528625
"However, the greater analytical complexity and interdependence associated with the globalization of financial markets notwithstanding, both theory and--perhaps more persuasively--recent experience support the view that the Federal Reserve retains considerable leverage over longer-term rates and key asset prices, although the links from monetary policy decisions to longer-term rates are somewhat looser than those to short-term rates.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9998078942298889
"Because long-term nominal interest rates can be viewed as the sum of a weighted average of expected future short-term nominal interest rates plus a term premium, Federal Reserve policies and communications substantially influence the behavior of these rates.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9998138546943665
"In analogous fashion, the Fedâ€™s ability to influence real interest rates at shorter horizons provides a lever for affecting longer-term real yields.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9997894167900085
"Like nominal long-term yields, real long-term yields can be viewed as an average of current and future expected short-term real rates, so that the effects of monetary policy on shorter-term real yields feed into longer-term yields as well.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9998195767402649
"Well-anchored inflation expectations are also helpful in this regard: If expectations of long-term inflation are stable, then changes in long-term nominal interest rates translate into similar changes in long-term real rates.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9998114705085754
The empirical literature supports the view that U.S. monetary policy retains its ability to influence longer-term rates and other asset prices.,2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9997978806495667
"Empirical studies also find that U.S. monetary policy actions retain a powerful effect on domestic stock prices.1 If globalization has not constrained the ability of U.S. monetary policy to influence domestic financial conditions, why are long-term interest rates and key asset prices so correlated across economies?",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9997935891151428

"Third, to the extent that some prices are set in internationally integrated markets, pressures on resource utilization in foreign economies could be relevant to domestic inflation.4 Some analysts might object to the proposition that globalization affects the inflation process at all on the grounds that the structural changes that globalization engenders can affect only the relative prices of goods and services; in contrast, inflation--the rate of change of the overall price level--must ultimately be determined solely by monetary policy (Ball, 2006).",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9997856020927429

"Many models, in particular, ignore the role of falling import prices in undermining the pricing power of producers of import-competing goods.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997661709785461
"Third, the pattern of wage change and inflation did not definitively reject the estimates of NAIRU and trend growth that underpinned my forecast; but neither did the outcome entirely reinforce my confidence in them.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997950196266174
"The poor forecast of inflation was not principally due, in my judgment, to errors in the wage and price equations.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997811913490295
"Nevertheless, I would have made smaller forecast errors if I had used an estimate of NAIRU a bit below my current estimate of 5 ½% and would have made a smaller error forecasting inflation if I had used a slightly higher estimate of trend growth.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997957348823547
"Fourth, I wonder whether the divergent pattern in unemployment and capacity utilization rates contributed to the lower-than-expected inflation last year.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.999788224697113
"Traditionally, these two measures of excess demand move together over the cycle.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997969269752502
"The capacity utilization rate for manufacturing barely budged over 1997, remaining slightly below the point at which it has traditionally been accompanied by an increase in inflation.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997782111167908
"If the historical relationship between unemployment and capacity utilization had been operative in this expansion, the capacity utilization rate would be more than two percentage points higher today.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997618794441223
The failure of capacity utilization rates to move into a range that typically is associated with upward pressure on inflation likely has much to do with the perception of an absence of pricing power by firms.,1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997621178627014
"It also may have encouraged firms to alter the way they operate in labor markets, encouraging them to avoid increases in wages that they were going to have difficulty passing along in higher prices.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.999727189540863
The net result is that there may be less inflation pressure than would normally be associated with the current rate of unemployment.,1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997923970222473
"Prospects for 1998 Economic growth is likely to slow over 1998 and inflation may rise somewhat, but remain modest.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9998260140419006
"However, a slowing in growth appears to be a higher probability than an increase in inflation.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997702240943909
"The economy ended 1997 with still very positive fundamentals, notwithstanding some apparent weakness in demand in the fourth quarter.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9998041987419128
"Momentum in income growth, a high level of wealth, a record level of consumer confidence, lower mortgage rates, and ready availability of jobs support the household sector.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997667670249939
Inflation is low.,1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997327923774719
It is from this base that growth is expected to slow over 1998 as a result of the combined effect of some spontaneous slowdown and the spillover from the Asian crisis.,1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9998113512992859
"The slowdown should move growth closer to a sustainable rate, rather than threaten recession.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997623562812805
A key for monetary policy will be whether growth slows to or below trend or remains above trend.,1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997782111167908
"This, in turn, will be an important consideration in the inflation outcome next year and risks of higher inflation thereafter, and will, for me, be an important consideration in the decision about monetary policy.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997575879096985
"A Slowdown in Growth An important rationale for a spontaneous slowing -- that is, one occurring without further Fed tightening -- is that the pattern of consistent upside surprises across aggregate demand components over 1997 is unlikely to be repeated.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9998075366020203
"In this case, the explanation for the faster-than-expected growth over 1997 provides a rationale for a slowdown over 1998.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9998063445091248
GDP growth appears likely to have exceeded 3% again in the fourth quarter.,1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997830986976624
"The production side data -- employment, hours worked, and industrial production -- certainly seem to point to solid growth, but the available data on demand components have been on the weak side.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997913241386414
The spillover effects from the Asian turmoil should further slow growth over 1998.,1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997699856758118
The degree of slowing in growth and the size of the depreciation in the exchange rates in the region still will be affected by policy actions to be taken by those authorities and the uncertain timing of any improvement in investor confidence.,1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997065663337708
"As a result, developments in Asia clearly add a considerable degree of uncertainty to the outlook, though around a forecast of slower growth and lower inflation than would otherwise have been the case.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997676014900208
"At this point, I expect, the direct effect of the shock from Asian developments on U.S. net exports would slow the growth in our GDP by roughly ½ percentage point.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.999792754650116
"Crosscurrents on Inflation Looking ahead, powerful crosscurrents should still be operating on inflation.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.999799907207489
"Second, the decline in inflation over the last year should be an important moderating force on wage change going forward, partially offsetting the first factor.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9998134970664978
"Third, the set of forces that have restrained inflation over the last year, the factors I have referred to as favorable supply shocks, will continue to restrain inflation.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997910857200623
The unemployment rate is well below most estimates of NAIRU.,1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997642636299133
"The resulting upward pressure on wage change and price inflation can be offset or even overwhelmed at times, as it was last year, by other influences.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997826218605042
"Nevertheless, the role of this consideration in inflation dynamics should not be overlooked or underestimated.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997487664222717
It starts me with a bias toward higher inflation.,1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997238516807556
The question is then whether there will be enough offsetting influences in 1998 to prevent inflation from rising.,1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997580647468567
One such offset is the virtuous cycle set in motion by the lower inflation in 1997.,1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997907280921936
The lower inflation last year should moderate the cyclical pressure for higher nominal wages over 1998.,1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997912049293518
"That is, the real wage increases produced by the lower inflation substitute for nominal wage gains that would otherwise have been required to achieve the higher path of real wages.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997919201850891
"The pattern in food, energy, computer, and import prices and in benefit costs will again be important factors shaping the inflation outlook this year.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997925162315369
The movements in these prices are not closely tied to the balance of supply and demand in overall labor and product markets and are often subject to wide swings and rapid reversals.,1998-01-08,TRUST,0.999777615070343
"Forecasts of these prices are, as a result, often wide of the mark.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997208714485168
"It appears that energy, import, and, of course, computer prices will decline again over 1998 and food prices increases will again be modest.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9998078942298889
"While there is likely to be at least a modest rebound in benefit costs, we should add to the list of factors restraining measured inflation the one to two tenths decline in CPI inflation associated with technical revisions to be introduced by the BLS this month.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997798800468445
The restraint likely from favorable supply shocks this year has recently been reinforced by a further decline in crude petroleum prices and the projected effect of the Asian crisis on import prices.,1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997904896736145
"On balance, it now appears that these forces will continue to restrain inflation over 1998 perhaps by about as much as was the case over 1997.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9998185038566589
"In this case, favorable supply shocks would be neutral factor on inflation this year, neither contributing to higher or lower inflation.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9998077750205994
"On balance, I expect a small increase in inflation in 1998.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997792840003967
"The upward pressure on inflation will also depend on what happens to utilization rates over the year, which in turn will depend on precisely how much growth slows.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.999774158000946
One final influence is the sharp cyclical slowing in productivity I expect.,1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997912049293518
This will raise unit labor costs and mainly undermine profit growth.,1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9996765851974487
But it could put some upward pressure on prices as well.,1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997040629386902
"Two Scenarios and the Challenges Facing Monetary Policy There are many possible outcomes, particularly given the uncertainty about the degree of spontaneous slowing and the dimensions of the spillover from the Asian crisis.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.999810516834259
"Because upside and downside risks for growth and inflation appear to be more balanced than had been the case earlier, I believe monetary policy also needs to be in a more balanced position.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997861981391907
"The course of monetary policy will, of course, depend on how much growth slows, what happens to utilization rates, and how the movement in utilization rates interacts with the other crosscurrents affecting inflation.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.999804675579071
"Continued above-trend growth and a further rise utilization rates, on the other hand, could encourage further tightening.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.999675989151001
"But I want to focus on two intermediate outcomes, both because I view these as more likely and because they would raise more interesting questions for monetary policy.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997860789299011
"As I noted earlier, in a soft landing, growth slows from an above-trend to trend rate just as output converges from below to its full employment level.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9998099207878113
But I believe output is already beyond the full employment level.,1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997034668922424
A soft landing in this case requires growth to run below trend for a period to allow productive capacity to catch up to demand and to allow utilization rates to ease to sustainable levels.,1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997751116752625
"Ordinarily, inflation would be rising during the transition, given initial conditions of output in excess of sustainable capacity.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997578263282776
"But, in the current episode, the virtuous cycle in play and renewal of forces that have recently been restraining inflation will continue to damp inflation over 1998, at least moderating the rise in inflation that would otherwise occur.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9998028874397278
"In this scenario, real growth slows to around 2% or slightly lower, the unemployment rate edges upward, but remains below NAIRU over 1998, and inflation is slightly higher.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997225403785706
"This is a path back toward full employment, leaving inflation higher but still modest once full employment is reached, perhaps by the end of 1999.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9998162388801575
How should monetary policy respond in this scenario?,1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997789263725281
Should policy ease in response to the sharp slowing in growth and rise in the unemployment rate?,1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997661709785461
"Or should policy remain on hold, allowing the economy to converge slowly back to full employment and a still modest inflation rate?",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997929930686951
"Given the momentum in domestic demand, the still favorable financial conditions and other fundamentals, questions about the degree of spontaneous slowing, and uncertainty about the magnitude of the spillover from the Asian crisis, an equally plausible forecast is that growth slows, but only to trend.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997871518135071
"In this case, the unemployment rate would remain near its current level and inflation would increase slightly more than in the first scenario, though it would still be damped in 1998 by the virtuous cycle forces and the continued favorable supply shocks.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997996687889099
"This scenario would, however, imply greater inflation risks going forward, in light of prospects that the favorable supply shocks eventually will abate, while the prevailing high labor utilization rate will continue to push wage gains higher.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9996776580810547
How should monetary policy respond in this case?,1998-01-08,TRUST,0.999782145023346
"Should policy remain on hold, given the return to a sustainable rate of growth and stable utilization rates?",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997772574424744
"Or, should there be a tightening of policy in light of the prospects for a gradual but persistent updrift in inflation associated with the still very high utilization rates?",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997480511665344
"The latter scenario is valuable in highlighting that the risks of higher inflation are related to the level of utilization rates, not to the rate of growth of output itself.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9997965693473816
"The point is that even if growth slows to trend, utilization rates could be left at unsustainable levels, leaving a risk of rising inflation over time.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9996792078018188
"We also face the common challenge of excessive inflation, which is no coincidence, since Germany and other countries are dealing with many of the same forces driving up inflation in the United States.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997599720954895
"We see that in the deepening and possible broadening of our security commitments, and we also see it in the strong commitment that central banks in Europe and elsewhere have made to fight inflation.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997629523277283
"First, I will provide my outlook for the U.S. economy and how the Federal Reserve plans to reduce inflation and achieve our 2 percent target.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997949004173279
Then I will pivot to a more academic discussion of the labor market and the possibility of a soft landing in which taming inflation does not harm employment.,2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997995495796204
"Despite a pause early this year in the growth of real gross domestic product (GDP), the U.S. economy continues to power along at a healthy pace.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997854828834534
"Consumer spending and business investment, which are the bedrock of GDP, were both strong, and more recent data point toward solid demand and continuing momentum in the economy that will sustain output growth in the months ahead.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997153878211975
"Unemployment is near a 50-year low, and both the low numbers of people filing for unemployment benefits and the high number of job openings indicate that the slowdown in the economy from the fast pace of last year isn't yet weighing on the job market.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.999782145023346
"As I will explain, this very tight labor market has implications for inflation and the Fed's plans for reducing inflation.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997891783714294
"But on its own terms, we need to recognize that robust job creation is an underlying strength of the U.S. economy, which is expanding its productive capacity and supporting personal income and ongoing economic growth, in the face of other challenges.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997541308403015
"Let me turn now to the outlook for the Fed's top priority, inflation.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9998076558113098
"I said in December that inflation was alarmingly high, and it has remained so.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997310042381287
The April consumer price index (CPI) was up 8.3 percent year over year.,2022-05-30,TRUST,0.999747097492218
This headline number was a slight decline from 8.5 percent in March but primarily due to a drop in volatile gasoline prices that we know surged again this month.,2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997674822807312
"Twelve-month ""core"" inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, was also down slightly to 6.2 percent in April, from 6.5 percent the month before, but the 0.6 percent monthly increase from March was an acceleration from the February to March rate and still too high.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9996979236602783
"Meanwhile, the Fed's preferred measure based on personal consumption expenditures (PCE) recorded headline inflation of 6.3 percent and core of 4.9 percent.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9998001456260681
"No matter which measure is considered, however, headline inflation has come in above 4 percent for about a year and core inflation is not coming down enough to meet the Fed's target anytime soon.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9996711015701294
"Inflation this high affects everyone but is especially painful for lower- and middle-income households that spend a large share of their income on shelter, groceries, gasoline, and other necessities.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.999729573726654
"It is the FOMC's job to meet our price stability mandate and get inflation down, and we are determined to do so.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.999760091304779
The forces driving inflation today are the same ones that emerged a year ago.,2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997894167900085
The combination of strong consumer demand and supply constraintsâ€”both bottlenecks and a shortage of workers relative to labor demandâ€”is generating very high inflation.,2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9996992349624634
"We can argue about whether supply or demand is a greater factor, but the details have no bearing on the fact that we are not meeting the FOMC's price stability mandate.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997245669364929
What I care about is getting inflation down so that we avoid a lasting escalation in the public's expectations of future inflation.,2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997612833976746
"Once inflation expectations become unanchored in this way, it is very difficult and economically painful to lower them.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997034668922424
"While it is not surprising that inflation expectations for the next year are up, since current inflation is high, what I focus on is longer-term inflation expectations.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997801184654236
"Overall, my assessment is that longer-range inflation expectations have moved up from a level that was consistent with trend inflation below 2 percent to a level that's consistent with underlying inflation a little above 2 percent.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997956156730652
"I will be watching that these expectations do not continue to rise because longer-term inflation expectations influence near term inflation, as well as our ability to achieve our 2 percent target.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997509121894836
"When they are anchored, they influence spending decisions today in a way that helps inflation move toward our target.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997791647911072
"To ensure these longer-term expectations do not move up broadly, the Federal Reserve has tools to reduce demand, which should ease inflation pressures.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997664093971252
"And, over time, supply constraints will resolve to help rein in price increases as well, although we don't know how soon.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997370839118958
I cannot emphasize enough that my FOMC colleagues and I are united in our commitment to do what it takes to bring inflation down and achieve the Fed's 2 percent target.,2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997441172599792
"In particular, I am not taking 50 basis-point hikes off the table until I see inflation coming down closer to our 2 percent target.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997091889381409
"And, by the end of this year, I support having the policy rate at a level above neutral so that it is reducing demand for products and labor, bringing it more in line with supply and thus helping rein in inflation.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9996589422225952
"In the next couple of weeks, for example, the May employment and CPI reports will be released.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997628331184387

Higher rates make it more expensive to finance spending and investment which should help reduce demand and contribute to lower inflation.,2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997672438621521
"In addition to raising rates, the FOMC further tightened monetary policy by ending asset purchases in March and then agreeing to start reducing our holdings of securities, a process that begins June 1.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.999748170375824
All these actions have the goal of bringing inflation down toward the FOMC's 2 percent target.,2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997759461402893
Increased rates and a smaller balance sheet raise the cost of borrowing and thus reduce household and business demand.,2022-05-30,TRUST,0.999721348285675
"On top of this, I also hope that over time supply problems resolve and help lower inflation.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997562766075134
"The United States is not alone in facing excessive inflation, and other central banks also are responding.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997643828392029
"In the euro area, headline inflation continued to edge up in April, to 7.5 percent, while its version of core inflation increased from 2.9 percent to 3.5 percent.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997366070747375
"Based on this broadening of price pressures, communication by the European Central Bank (ECB) is widely interpreted as signaling that it will likely start raising its policy rate this summer and that it could raise rates a few times before year-end.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.999671459197998

"These two dots suggest that the vacancy rate can be reduced substantially, from the current level to the January 2019 level, while still leaving the level of vacancies consistent with a strong labor market and with a low level of unemployment, such as we had in 2019.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9998012185096741
"To see why this is a plausible outcome, I first need to digress a bit to discuss the important determinants of unemployment.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9998026490211487
"Many factors influence the unemployment rate, and vacancies are just one.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997643828392029
"Thus, to understand how a lower vacancy rate would influence unemployment going forward, we need to separate the direct effect of vacancies on the unemployment rate from other factors.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997900128364563
"To do that, we first need to review the factors that account for unemployment movements.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9998025298118591
"There are two broad determinants of unemployment: separations from employment (including layoffs and quits), which raise unemployment, and job finding by the unemployed, which lowers unemployment.2 Separations consist largely of layoffs, which are typically cyclical, surging in recessions and falling during booms.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9998005032539368
"To see how separations and job finding affect the unemployment rate, it's helpful to start with equation (1) on slide 6, which states that in a steady state (that is, when the unemployment rate is constant), flows into unemployment, the left side of equation (1), must equal flows out of unemployment, the right side.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.999782383441925

"Flows out of unemployment, the right side of the equation, equal the rate of job finding, $$f$$, times the number of unemployed.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9998072981834412
"Rearranging this equation yields an expression for the steady-state unemployment rate, equation (2).3 Because flows into and out of unemployment are quite high, the actual unemployment rate converges to the steady-state unemployment rate quickly, and the steady-state unemployment rate typically tracks the actual rate closely.4 So, going forward, I'm going to think of the steady-state unemployment rate as a good approximation of the actual unemployment rate.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9998154044151306

"On the one hand, if the workers searching for jobs are well suited for the jobs that are available, matching efficiency will be high; on the other hand, if many searching workers are not well suited for the available jobs, matching efficiency will be low.6 The last step is to plug our expression for job finding into equation (2), the steady-state unemployment rate, yielding equation (5).",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997982382774353
Equation (5) shows how vacancies affect the unemployment rate.,2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997910857200623

"What does all this suggest about what will happen to the labor market when, as I expect, a tightening of financial conditions and fading fiscal stimulus start to cool labor demand?",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.999797523021698
"Slide 10 focuses on the Beveridge curve (the relationship produced by the direct effect of changes in vacancies on unemployment) when the separations rate is low, as it is now.7 The March 2022 observation lies at the top of the curve and is labeled point A.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9998157620429993
"If there is cooling in aggregate demand spurred by monetary policy tightening that tempers labor demand, then vacancies should fall substantially.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997695088386536
"Then we should travel down the curve from point A to point B.8 The unemployment rate will increase, but only somewhat because labor demand is still strongâ€”just not as strongâ€”and because when the labor market is very tight, as it is now, vacancies generate relatively few hires.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997794032096863

"If labor demand cools, will separations increase and shift the curve outward, increasing unemployment further?",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997419714927673

"Another consideration is that non-linear dynamics could take hold if the unemployment rate increases by a certain amount, as suggested by the Sahm rule, which holds that recessions have in the past occurred whenever the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate rises 0.5 percentage point over its minimum rate over the previous 12 months.9 We certainly need to be alert to this possibility, but the past is not always prescriptive of the future.",2022-05-30,TRUST,0.9997590184211731
