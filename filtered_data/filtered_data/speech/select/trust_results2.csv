"The major reason for these significant differences in spending out of household wealth is doubtless that, while home prices do on occasion decline, large declines are rare; the general experience of homeowners is a modest, but persistent, rise in home values that is perceived to be largely permanent.",1999-11-02,TRUST,0.9942654967308044

"1 Car and Driver: A Misleading Analogy Eight times each year the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets to set U.S. monetary policy--which, under current operating procedures, amounts to choosing a target for the federal funds rate, a short-term interest rate that the Federal Reserve influences by controlling the supply of bank reserves.",2004-12-02,TRUST,0.993516206741333

"Making Monetary Policy: Two Candidate Frameworks The two frameworks for monetary policymaking I will compare today are generally referred to in the recent economics literature as instrument rules and targeting rules (Svensson, 2003; McCallum and Nelson, 2004; Svensson, 2004b).",2004-12-02,TRUST,0.9945355653762817

"Under a simple feedback policy, the central bank's policy instrument--the federal funds rate in the United States--is closely linked to the behavior of a relatively small number of macroeconomic variables, variables that either are directly observable (such as employment or inflation) or can be estimated from current information (such as the economy's full-employment level of output).",2004-12-02,TRUST,0.9942197799682617
"I exclude from my definition of simple feedback policies any policy that links the policy instrument to forecasts of macroeconomic variables, such as output and inflation; hybrid policies of this type raise difficult issues that would take me too far afield today.",2004-12-02,TRUST,0.9936777949333191
"3 Generally, the macroeconomic variables that drive simple feedback policies are chosen to reflect the central bank's objectives, and policymakers are directed to adjust the short-term interest rate (or other policy instrument) as needed to offset deviations of these variables from their desired levels.",2004-12-02,TRUST,0.9941650032997131
In its most basic version the Taylor rule is an equation that relates the current setting of the federal funds rate to two variables: the level of the output gap (the deviation of output from its full-employment level) and the difference between the inflation rate and the policy committee's preferred inflation rate.,2004-12-02,TRUST,0.9939514398574829
"Like most feedback policies, the Taylor rule instructs policymakers to ""lean against the wind""; for example, when output is above its potential or inflation is above the target, the Taylor rule implies that the federal funds rate should be set above its average level, which (all else being equal) should slow the economy and bring output or inflation back toward the desired range.4 Numerous simple feedback policies other than those based on the Taylor rule have been proposed and analyzed.5 How does the use of simple feedback policies address the issues I raised earlier--namely, the problem of limited information and the need to account for private-sector expectations when making policy?",2004-12-02,TRUST,0.9953515529632568
"Because simple feedback policies link the central bank's policy instrument to a short list of macroeconomic variables, these policies should be relatively easy for the public to understand and to use in forming expectations of the way monetary policy will evolve in the future.",2004-12-02,TRUST,0.9941686391830444
"Say, for example, that the feedback policy employed by the central bank stipulates that, when inflation rises 10 basis points, policymakers will raise the short-term interest rate 15 basis points on average, subject to possible judgmental adjustments.",2004-12-02,TRUST,0.9947351217269897
"Armed with this information and their own estimates of how strong inflation pressures are likely to be over the next few quarters, financial market participants should be able to forecast future values of the short-term interest rate, allowing them to price bonds and other financial assets more efficiently.",2004-12-02,TRUST,0.9940010905265808

"This dominance is reflected in the resources that central banks devote to data collection and modeling and in the increasing sophistication and detail of central bank forecasts.9 Indeed, a number of central banks with explicit inflation objectives publish regular forecasts and closely link monetary policy decisions to those forecasts.",2004-12-02,TRUST,0.9950843453407288

"In short, upon determining that an important structural change was occurring, the FOMC did not feel constrained to respond to current developments in output and inflation as it had in the past--an indication that the Committee's policymaking was based on a forecast-based analysis, not a simple feedback approach.",2004-12-02,TRUST,0.9940695762634277
"Perhaps the most interesting confirmation of the role of forecasts in Federal Reserve policymaking, however, is Chairman Greenspan's description of what he calls the risk-management approach to monetary policy.",2004-12-02,TRUST,0.9951188564300537
"To reiterate, however, the policy framework espoused by Chairman Greenspan is very much a forecast-based approach; indeed, because it requires making judgments about unlikely as well as likely economic outcomes, it places greater demands on our ability to forecast and to assess risks than do simpler forecast-based approaches that focus on average outcomes only.",2004-12-02,TRUST,0.9948740601539612
"I note, however, that not only have most central banks chosen to rely most heavily on forecast-based policies but also that the results, at least in recent years, have generally been quite good, as most economies have enjoyed low inflation and overall economic stability.11 So long as this good performance persists, at least, the simple feedback approach will face a sort of Catch-22 problem: Without a demonstrated record of success, central banks will be reluctant to adopt this approach; but unless some central banks begin to rely on simple feedback policies, real-world evidence in support of this approach will be lacking.12 Flexibility and Communication In previous talks I have argued that clear communication by the central bank is an important element of effective monetary policy (Bernanke, 2004).",2004-12-02,TRUST,0.9954342246055603

"For example, the price of oil at the end of 1998 was a little more than $11 per barrel; over the next two years the price of oil tripled, exceeding $34 per barrel late in 2000.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9940392971038818
"Then, over the subsequent year, the price of oil suddenly reversed itself, dropping 40 percent.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9932302236557007
"Despite these gyrations, core inflation remained firmly anchored throughout the period, registering between 1.5 percent and 2.0 percent on a twelve-month basis in every month.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9927383065223694
"Although structural changes have occurred in the economy since the 1970s, including increased energy efficiency, this difference in the degree of pass-through from oil prices to general inflation can be explained, in my view, only by differences in the stability of inflation and inflation expectations.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9937454462051392
"Overall, it is reasonable to conclude that macro policy, particularly monetary policy, was the most important single reason for the poor economic performance experienced during the U.S. Great Inflation.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9933932423591614
Constrained discretion and inflation targeting I mentioned at the beginning of the talk that constrained discretion characterizes at least to some degree the policy approach of many of the major central banks around the world.,2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9943313598632812
"It is, in fact, closely related to the policy framework known as inflation targeting.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9931207299232483
"Let me take a moment to explain the relationship between what I have termed ""constrained discretion"" and the more familiar concept of inflation targeting.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9938761591911316
"It is useful, I think, to divide monetary policymaking into two parts--roughly, what you do and what you say about it.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9946900606155396
The details of inflation-targeting regimes vary by country and have evolved over time.,2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9939595460891724
"Broadly speaking, however, the operational, or ""what you do,"" side of what I consider to be best-practice inflation targeting is well described as constrained discretion, as I have characterized it here.15 Specifically, most inflation-targeting central banks try to stabilize output and employment subject to the constraint that inflation remain low and stable--in the case of formal inflation targeters, of course, within the declared target range for inflation.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.99534010887146
"As I have noted, constrained discretion also describes reasonably well the recent policy approach of the Federal Reserve, though of course the Fed does not have publicly announced inflation targets.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9940377473831177
"Thus, on the operational side, the policy frameworks of the Federal Reserve and of the leading central banks with formal inflation targets are today rather similar.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9943358302116394
"The second element of inflation targeting--the communication, or ""what you say,"" side--consists of not only a public announcement of a target range for inflation (the hallmark of inflation targeting) but also a variety of other mechanisms for talking to markets and the public.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9941480159759521
"These include the regular publication of so-called Inflation Reports, release of forecasts, prompt release of minutes, and other measures.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9943377375602722
"Here is the principal area in which the Federal Reserve--though it has certainly become markedly more transparent in the past decade--has not chosen to adopt the whole framework of inflation targeting.16 Many have concluded that central banks that have adopted the transparency and communication aspects of inflation targeting have strengthened their overall policy performance--through enhanced communication to the public of their objectives and plans, improved management of expectations, greater consistency of policy, and heightened accountability.17 The Fed has much in common with other major central banks, but of course it also differs in important ways, including its history, legal framework, and institutional structure.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9951545000076294
Conclusion My objective today has been to lay out the advantages of using a framework of constrained discretion for making monetary policy.,2003-02-03,TRUST,0.995536208152771
The essence of constrained discretion is the central role of a commitment to price stability.,2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9942301511764526
"Not only does such a commitment enhance efficiency, employment, and economic growth in the long run, but--by providing an anchor for inflation expectations--it also improves the ability of central banks to stabilize the real economy in the short run as well.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9941944479942322
"An important and interesting implication is that, under a properly designed and implemented monetary policy regime, the key social objectives of price stability and maximum employment tend to be mutually reinforcing rather than competing goals.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.99428790807724
"To the best of my knowledge, this term was first used in connection with monetary policy by Bernanke and Mishkin (1997).",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9944201111793518
Throughout this talk I follow a common Fed practice in using the core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) deflator to measure inflation.,2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9928210377693176
"Relative to the more familiar consumer price index (CPI), the PCE deflator (1) has broader coverage, (2) is believed to be based on more accurate expenditure weights, (3) is constructed in a manner that reduces so-called substitution bias, (4) is measured more consistently over time, and (5) arguably does a better job measuring medical inflation.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9947711825370789
"The core PCE deflator excludes volatile components, notably the prices of food and energy.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9938123226165771
"Core inflation measures in general are probably better indicators of the underlying rate of inflation, with which central banks are typically most concerned.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9933431148529053
Standard inflation measures probably overstate increases in true inflation by about 1.0 percentage point.,2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9933950304985046
"For example, Lebow and Rudd (2002) estimate that measured inflation using the consumer price index overstates the actual change in the cost of living by about 0.9 percentage points per year, with a confidence interval ranging from 0.3 percentage point to l.4 percentage points per year.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9945142269134521
"In addition, as I discussed in a previous talk, aiming for an inflation rate modestly above zero provides a useful buffer against deflation risk.",2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9944884777069092
Stock and Watson (2002) note that the standard deviation of annual growth rates in real GDP fell from 2.7 percent during 1960-83 to only 1.6 percent in 1984-2001.,2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9942276477813721
They attribute 20 to 30 percent of this reduction in volatility to improvements in monetary policy.,2003-02-03,TRUST,0.9940199851989746
"At the broadest level, globalization influences the conduct of monetary policy through its powerful effects on the economic and financial environment in which monetary policy must operate.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9940681457519531
"As you know, several decades of global economic integration have left a large imprint on the structure of the U.S. economy, including changes in patterns of production, employment, trade, and financial flows.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9950547218322754
"Other than by contributing to general economic and financial stability, monetary policy can do little to affect these structural changes or the powerful economic forces that drive them.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9936404824256897
"However, to make effective policy, the Federal Reserve must have as full an understanding as possible of the factors determining economic growth, employment, and inflation in the U.S. economy, whether those influences originate at home or abroad.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9942213296890259
"A narrower question, but one that is critical for monetary policy makers, is whether the increased openness of the U.S. economy has in some way affected the ability of the Federal Reserve to meet its congressional mandate to foster price stability and maximum sustainable employment.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9944941401481628
"On this issue, some analysts have argued that globalization hinders monetary policy--for example, by reducing the ability of the Federal Reserve to affect U.S. interest rates and asset prices or by diminishing the role of domestic factors in the inflation process.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9938026666641235
You will not be surprised to hear that the Federal Reserve System is quite interested in the implications of globalization for the conduct and effectiveness of monetary policy.,2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9943431615829468
"The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas has created a Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute, which will support the study of globalizationâ€™s effects on policy and the economy, and a number of other Reserve Banks have undertaken similar efforts.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9942189455032349
In the remainder of my talk I will discuss two channels through which globalization may have affected the transmission and effectiveness of U.S. monetary policy.,2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9932922124862671
"First, I will consider whether the globalization of finance has weakened or otherwise affected the ability of U.S. monetary policy to influence domestic financial market conditions.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9942307472229004
"Second, I will discuss what we know about the way international factors influence the determination of inflation, a key goal variable for monetary policy.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9947785139083862
"Globalization, Monetary Policy, and Financial MarketsMonetary policy works in the first instance by affecting financial conditions, including the levels of interest rates and asset prices.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9941092729568481
Does financial globalization significantly reduce the influence of the Federal Reserve on financial conditions in the United States and thereby possibly make U.S. monetary policy less effective?,2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9932169318199158
"Certainly, the financial environment in which U.S. monetary policy is made has been irrevocably changed by the remarkable increases in the magnitudes of financial flows into and out of the United States.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9946081638336182
"Given their scale, capital inflows and outflows certainly influence long-term U.S. interest rates and other key asset prices, both by affecting the underlying supply-demand balance between saving and capital investment and by helping to determine the premiums that investors receive for holding assets that are risky or illiquid.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9937426447868347
How does all this affect monetary policy?,2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9946014881134033
It is helpful to think about the potential implications of globalized financial markets for monetary policy by beginning with the first stages of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.,2007-03-02,TRUST,0.994114339351654
"In particular, as you know, the Federal Reserve influences financial conditions through its ability to control the federal funds rate, the interest rate at which banks lend to each other overnight.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9941157102584839
"Although the federal funds rate does not itself have a major influence on economic activity, other short-term rates--such as Eurodollar rates--are determined largely by the current and expected future values of the funds rate, reflecting the close substitutability of alternative short-term sources of funding.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9942564368247986
"The Federal Reserveâ€™s ability to control the federal funds rate thus gives it a strong influence over other short-term dollar nominal interest rates and, to the extent that inflation is inertial or sticky in the short run, over short-term real interest rates as well.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9939284324645996
"The Fedâ€™s ability to set the short-term interest rate independently of foreign financial conditions depends critically, of course, on the fact that the dollar is a freely floating currency whose value is continuously determined in open, competitive markets.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9940140843391418
"Because the dollar is free to adjust, U.S. interest rates can differ from rates abroad, and, consequently, the Fed retains the autonomy to set its federal funds rate target as needed to respond to domestic economic conditions.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9923717975616455
"Short-term interest rates affect the domestic economy through a number of channels (for example, by affecting the cost of holding inventories), so monetary policy could influence economic activity to some degree even if its control were limited to the short end of the yield curve.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9941213726997375
"Nevertheless, the ability to influence longer-term interest rates and the prices of longer-term assets is an important component of the Fedâ€™s toolkit for managing aggregate demand.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9939216375350952
The behavior of long-term interest rates over the past few years is a case in point.,2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9938341379165649
"Compared with historical averages, long-term nominal interest rates have remained relatively low in recent years--the phenomenon that the previous Chairman, Alan Greenspan, termed a â€œconundrumâ€--even as the Federal Reserve was withdrawing monetary accommodation by raising the target for the federal funds rate by more than 400 basis points.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9938044548034668
"For example, strong foreign demand for U.S. long-term debt has been one factor tending to reduce the term premium, the extra return that investors demand to hold longer-term bonds.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9934014678001404
"All else equal, a smaller term premium implies a lower level of long-term interest rates.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.993285059928894
"At the same time, increases in the net supply of saving in global capital markets--which, to a significant extent, are a product of the large current account surpluses of some emerging-market economies and of oil-producing nations--have resulted in lower real long-term interest rates both in the United States and abroad.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9943870306015015
"Clearly, to understand and evaluate the behavior of the term structure and to assess the implications of current yields for the domestic economy, the Fed must take into account the various effects of foreign capital flows on U.S. yields and asset prices, a task that can be quite challenging.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9944555163383484
One statistical indicator of that interdependence is that the correlations between long-term interest rates in the United States and those in other industrial countries are high and appear to have risen significantly in the last few years.,2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9942095279693604
That interdependence suggests that monetary policy makers must pay attention to conditions abroad as well as at home.,2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9936913251876831
"However, the greater analytical complexity and interdependence associated with the globalization of financial markets notwithstanding, both theory and--perhaps more persuasively--recent experience support the view that the Federal Reserve retains considerable leverage over longer-term rates and key asset prices, although the links from monetary policy decisions to longer-term rates are somewhat looser than those to short-term rates.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9948941469192505
"Because long-term nominal interest rates can be viewed as the sum of a weighted average of expected future short-term nominal interest rates plus a term premium, Federal Reserve policies and communications substantially influence the behavior of these rates.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9938355088233948
"In analogous fashion, the Fedâ€™s ability to influence real interest rates at shorter horizons provides a lever for affecting longer-term real yields.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.994128942489624
"Like nominal long-term yields, real long-term yields can be viewed as an average of current and future expected short-term real rates, so that the effects of monetary policy on shorter-term real yields feed into longer-term yields as well.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9944437146186829
"Well-anchored inflation expectations are also helpful in this regard: If expectations of long-term inflation are stable, then changes in long-term nominal interest rates translate into similar changes in long-term real rates.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9945271611213684
The empirical literature supports the view that U.S. monetary policy retains its ability to influence longer-term rates and other asset prices.,2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9935888051986694
"Empirical studies also find that U.S. monetary policy actions retain a powerful effect on domestic stock prices.1 If globalization has not constrained the ability of U.S. monetary policy to influence domestic financial conditions, why are long-term interest rates and key asset prices so correlated across economies?",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9936838150024414
"Recent research suggests another possibility, which is that U.S. monetary policy actions may have significant effects on foreign yields and asset prices as well as on domestic financial prices.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.993196964263916
"For example, changes in U.S. short-term interest rates seem to exert a substantial influence on euro area bond yields (Ehrmann, Fratzscher, and Rigobon, 2005; Faust and others, 2006) and appear to have a strong effect on foreign equity indexes as well.2 In contrast, the effects of foreign short-term rates on U.S. asset prices appear to be relatively weaker.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9946856498718262
"But, second, globalization has added a dimension of complexity to the analysis of financial conditions and their determinants, which monetary policy makers must take into account.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9938753247261047
"Has Globalization Affected the U.S. Inflation Process?Other than through its influence on financial markets, globalization may also have affected the operation of monetary policy by changing the relative importance of the various factors that determine the domestic inflation rate.3 As national markets become increasingly integrated and open, sellers of goods, services, and labor may face more competition and have less market power than in the past.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9946335554122925
"In particular, prices and wages may depend on economic conditions abroad as well as on conditions in the local market.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9936500191688538
"These linkages suggest that, at least in the short run, globalization and trade may affect the course of domestic inflation.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9942628741264343
International factors might affect domestic inflation through several related channels.,2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9931816458702087
"First, the expansion of trade may cause domestic inflation to depend to a greater extent on the prices of imported goods--not only because imported goods enter the consumer basket or (in the case of imported intermediate goods) affect the costs of domestic production, but because competition with imports affects the pricing power of domestic producers.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9941909909248352
"Second, competitive pressures engendered by globalization could affect the inflation process by increasing productivity growth, thereby reducing costs, or by reducing markups.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9944759011268616
"Third, to the extent that some prices are set in internationally integrated markets, pressures on resource utilization in foreign economies could be relevant to domestic inflation.4 Some analysts might object to the proposition that globalization affects the inflation process at all on the grounds that the structural changes that globalization engenders can affect only the relative prices of goods and services; in contrast, inflation--the rate of change of the overall price level--must ultimately be determined solely by monetary policy (Ball, 2006).",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9946781396865845
"Certainly, monetary policy determines inflation in the long run, and the central bank must take responsibility for the inflation outcomes generated by its policies.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9940296411514282
"For example, the opening of trade with emerging-market economies that have low labor costs may reduce the relative prices of imported manufactures, but if the long-run inflation objective of the central bank is held constant, then the ultimate effect of the lower import prices on inflation will be nil as changes in other prices offset the effect of import prices.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9944855570793152
"However, the conclusion that inflation is determined only by monetary policy choices need not hold in the short-to-medium run.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9943233728408813
"In the shorter term, central banks do not usually offset completely the effects of shocks to supply or prices--of which a change in the relative price of imports is an example--in part because any monetary action made in response will take time to be effective.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9936467409133911
"Consequently, such shocks may affect domestic inflation for a time.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9930144548416138
"More subtly, a central bank following a strategy of â€œopportunistic disinflationâ€ might react to a favorable shock to supply or prices by lowering its medium-term objective for inflation (Orphanides and Wilcox, 2002).",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9938708543777466
"In the case of a central bank pursuing such a strategy, foreign factors that depress domestic inflation may have a persistent effect so long as inflation exceeds the central bankâ€™s long-term objective.5 What, then, is the evidence for the view that globalization is affecting the inflation process in the United States?",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9940892457962036
"Of the various channels that have been suggested, probably the most intuitive is the idea that greater openness to trade has increased the influence of import prices on domestic inflation.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9949510097503662
"In the major industrial economies over the past decade or so, import prices--particularly the prices of imported manufactured goods--have generally risen at a slower rate than other consumer prices, slowing overall inflation.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9935969114303589
"The slower growth in import prices reflects to some extent rapid productivity gains in the production of manufactures, an important component of trade.6 Increased exports by low-cost emerging-market economies have also helped keep down the prices of imports received by the United States and other industrialized countries.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9949709177017212
"Overall, research indicates that trade with developing economies in particular has slowed the rate of growth of import prices faced by industrialized countries, with estimates of the reduction ranging widely from 1/2 to 2 percentage points.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.994516909122467
"One study, for example, estimated that trade with China alone has reduced annual import price inflation in the United States by about 1 percentage point over the period 1993-2002 (Kamin, Marazzi, and Schindler, 2006)7.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9949100613594055
"However, imported goods make up only part of what people consume, and so the effect on overall inflation is less than the deceleration in the prices of imports alone.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9932149648666382
Typical estimates of the short-term effect on the overall inflation rate of less-rapid increases in the prices of imports stemming from trade with China are in the neighborhood of 0.1 percent or less per year--a discernible but certainly not a large effect.,2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9942249655723572
"First, the direct effect of lower import prices on overall consumer price inflation could understate the overall effect, if lower import prices force competing domestic firms to restrain their prices as well.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9934262037277222
"Research has generally found that import prices do affect the prices charged by domestic producers.8 For example, the International Monetary Fund found that, in a range of industrial economies, the prices of domestic products were restrained by competition from imports, the effect being larger with greater penetration (IMF, 2006).",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.994617760181427
"To the extent that import competition slows the rate of increase of domestic prices, the tendency of lower-cost imports to reduce domestic inflation will be enhanced.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9940690994262695
"On the other hand, not all aspects of globalization and trade reduce inflation.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.993466317653656
"For example, globalization has been associated with strong growth in some large emerging-market economies, notably China and India, and this growth likely has contributed to recent increases in the prices of energy and other commodities.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9947526454925537
"During 2003-05, for example, China alone accounted for nearly one-third of the growth in both global real gross domestic product (GDP) and oil consumption.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.994158148765564
"It is difficult to assess the exact extent to which increased demand by developing countries has contributed to the run-ups in commodity prices in recent years, as these prices are also affected by supply conditions and other factors.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9936243295669556
"However, one study estimated that, if the share of world trade and world GDP enjoyed by non-industrial countries had remained at its 2000 levels, then by 2005 real oil prices would have been as much as 40 percent lower, and real metals prices 10 percent lower, than they actually were (Pain, Koske, and Sollie, 2006).",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9942421317100525
"Accordingly, in the past several years, the effect of growth in developing economies on commodity prices has been a source of upward pressure on inflation in the United States and other industrial economies.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9934877157211304
"When the offsetting effects of globalization on the prices of manufactured imports and on energy and commodity prices are considered together, there seems to be little basis for concluding that globalization overall has significantly reduced inflation in the United States in recent years; indeed, the opposite may be true.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.993884265422821
"That said, the integration of rapidly industrializing economies into the global trading system clearly has had important effects on the prices of both manufactures and commodities, reinforcing the need to monitor international influences on the inflation process.",2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9940714240074158
Globalization also may affect the inflation process through other channels.,2007-03-02,TRUST,0.9937111139297485

"Third, the pattern of wage change and inflation did not definitively reject the estimates of NAIRU and trend growth that underpinned my forecast; but neither did the outcome entirely reinforce my confidence in them.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9941093921661377
"The poor forecast of inflation was not principally due, in my judgment, to errors in the wage and price equations.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9939846396446228

"Fourth, I wonder whether the divergent pattern in unemployment and capacity utilization rates contributed to the lower-than-expected inflation last year.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9941184520721436
"Traditionally, these two measures of excess demand move together over the cycle.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9940045475959778

"If the historical relationship between unemployment and capacity utilization had been operative in this expansion, the capacity utilization rate would be more than two percentage points higher today.",1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9933302998542786
The failure of capacity utilization rates to move into a range that typically is associated with upward pressure on inflation likely has much to do with the perception of an absence of pricing power by firms.,1998-01-08,TRUST,0.9938732385635376

"To get things going, I thought I would start with some brief remarks on the current state of play in monetary policy.",2013-06-28,TRUST,0.9935826659202576
"The first is its flow-based, state-contingent nature--the notion that we intend to continue with purchases until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.",2013-06-28,TRUST,0.9941253662109375
"Back then, the unemployment rate was 8.1percent and nonfarm payrolls were reported to have increased at a monthly rate of 97,000 over the prior six months; today, those figures are 7.6 percent and 194,000, respectively.",2013-06-28,TRUST,0.9932159781455994
"Back then, FOMC participants were forecasting unemployment rates around 7-3/4 percent and 7 percent for year-end 2013 and 2014, respectively, in our Summary of Economic Projections; as of the June 2013 round, these forecasts have been revised down roughly 1/2 percentage point each.",2013-06-28,TRUST,0.9947057366371155
"However, this very progress has brought communications challenges to the fore, since the further down the road we get, the more information the market demands about the conditions that would lead us to reduce and eventually end our purchases.",2013-06-28,TRUST,0.9932270646095276
"In particular, I view Chairman Bernanke's remarks at his press conference--in which he suggested that if the economy progresses generally as we anticipate then the asset purchase program might be expected to wrap up when unemployment falls to the 7 percent range--as an effort to put more specificity around the heretofore less well-defined notion of ""substantial progress.""",2013-06-28,TRUST,0.994662880897522
It would have been difficult for the Committee to put forward a 7 percent unemployment goal when the current program started and unemployment was 8.1 percent; this would have involved a lot of uncertainty about the magnitude of asset purchases required to reach this goal.,2013-06-28,TRUST,0.9939817786216736
"However, as we get closer to our goals, the balance sheet uncertainty becomes more manageable--at the same time that the market's demand for specificity goes up.",2013-06-28,TRUST,0.9937375783920288
"However, when there is a two-way feedback between financial conditions and FOMC actions, an initial perception that noisy recent data play a central role in the policy process can become somewhat self-fulfilling and can itself be the cause of extraneous volatility in asset prices.",2013-06-28,TRUST,0.9940920472145081
"If the news is bad, and it is confirmed by further bad news in October and November, this would suggest that the 7 percent unemployment goal is likely to be further away, and the remainder of the program would be extended accordingly.",2013-06-28,TRUST,0.9929842948913574
"In sum, I believe that effective communication for us at this stage involves the following key principles: (1) reaffirming the data-dependence of the asset purchase program, (2) giving more clarity on the type of data that will determine the endpoint of the program, as the Chairman did in his discussion of the unemployment goal, and (3) basing interim adjustments to the pace of purchases at any meeting primarily on the accumulated progress toward our goals and not overemphasizing the most recent momentum in the data.",2013-06-28,TRUST,0.9947051405906677
"Specifically, we continue to have a 6.5 percent unemployment threshold for beginning to consider a first increase in the federal funds rate.",2013-06-28,TRUST,0.9934943318367004
"If, for example, inflation readings continue to be on the soft side, we will have greater scope for keeping the funds rate at its effective lower bound even beyond the point when unemployment drops below 6.5percent.",2013-06-28,TRUST,0.9938264489173889
"Yet as research has repeatedly demonstrated, these sorts of fundamentals only explain a small part of the variation in the prices of assets such as equities, long-term Treasury securities, and corporate bonds.",2013-06-28,TRUST,0.9945865869522095
"The bulk of the variation comes from what finance academics call ""changes in discount rates,"" which is a fancy way of saying the non-fundamental stuff that we don't understand very well--and which can include changes in either investor sentiment or risk aversion, price movements due to forced selling by either levered investors or convexity hedgers, and a variety of other effects that fall under the broad heading of internal market dynamics.",2013-06-28,TRUST,0.9948798418045044
This observation reminds us that it often doesn't make sense to try to explain a large movement in asset prices by looking for a correspondingly large change in expectations about economic fundamentals.,2013-06-28,TRUST,0.9942017197608948
"So while we have seen very significant increases in long-term Treasury yields since the FOMC meeting, I think it is a mistake to infer from these movements that there must have been an equivalently big change in monetary policy fundamentals.",2013-06-28,TRUST,0.993732750415802
My only point is that consumers and businesses who look to asset prices for clues about the future stance of monetary policy should take care not to over-interpret these movements.,2013-06-28,TRUST,0.9938645958900452
"I hope that you will conclude from this discussion that, though the process of setting monetary policy is complex, it is nonetheless in many important ways accessible to the average citizen.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9941942095756531

Let me shift now from the mechanics of the process to the broader conceptual issues that confront the conduct of monetary policy and some of the issues surrounding the outlook for the U.S. economy.,1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9940586090087891
The Goals of Monetary Policy Federal law establishes the goals of monetary policy.,1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9940881729125977
"The Federal Reserve and the FOMC are ""to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.""",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9945019483566284
"Many analysts believe that achieving price stability should be the primary goal of a central bank because a stable level of prices appears to be the condition most conducive to maximum sustained output and employment, and to moderate long-term interest rates.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.993898868560791
"This presumably is because in times of price stability the prices of goods, materials and services are undistorted by inflation and thus can serve as clearer signals and guides for the efficient allocation of resources.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9940513968467712
"Also, a background of stable prices is thought to encourage capital formation because it reduces the distortion created by a tax system that is only partly indexed for inflation.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9945161938667297
Some would argue that the remarkable period of growth that we are experiencing is due in no small measure to the low rate of inflation that has prevailed for some time.,1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9939566850662231
"In the long run, I have no doubt that price stability underpins efforts to achieve maximum output and employment.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9940569400787354
"But, in the short run, some tensions can arise between efforts to reduce inflation and efforts to maximize employment and output.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9937297105789185
"For example, the economy may at times be faced with adverse developments affecting supply, such as a bad agricultural harvest or a disruption in the supply of oil, which put upward pressure on prices and downward pressure on output and employment.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9936960339546204
"In these circumstances, makers of monetary policy must decide the extent to which we should focus on defusing price pressures or on cushioning the loss of output and employment in the short run, while still keeping an eye on our long-term objectives.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9945523142814636
"At other times, policymakers may be concerned that expectations of inflation will get built into decisions about wages and prices and, become a self-fulfilling prophecy.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9936625957489014
Countering this threat of inflation with a more restrictive monetary policy could risk small losses of output and employment in the short run but might make it possible to avoid larger losses later should expectations of higher inflation become embedded in the economy.,1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9941756725311279
"These labels are an effort to simplify, in fact oversimplify, the complex choices that each member of the FOMC must make in deciding how to trade off the risk that action, or inaction, on our part will lead to inflation heating up to unacceptable levels, against the risk of having inadequate creation of jobs.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9938963055610657
"But I believe that all members of the Committee recognize that, over the longer haul, the major contribution the Federal Reserve can make to higher standards of living is to promote price stability.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9940184354782104
"It is generally thought that monetary policy takes many months to have most of its effect on the growth of output and employment, while, of course, it has an immediate impact on financial markets.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.993914783000946
"Because of the long time-frame in which the effects on the real economy are realized, I believe that it is important for policy to look ahead as it aims at promoting stable prices and a sustainable GDP growth path, along which the economy is at full potential.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.994635283946991
"Given that we need to be forward-looking, or ""preemptive,"" as it is often put, one potentially important element in making monetary policy is the forecast or likely outlook for economic growth, unemployment and the price level for the next year or two.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9940166473388672
"Fortunately, as we make monetary policy we have the advantage of several forecasts.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9943260550498962
"To be useful for monetary policy, forecasts of the future health of the economy need to be reasonably reliable.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9941216111183167
"As one example, the failure of price inflation to pick up, as labor markets have become tighter is not consistent with the simple correlations that were so apparent in earlier cycles.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9937710165977478
"Moreover, factors outside of economists' models have provided some surprises, such as the Asian economic and financial turmoil and the gyration of oil prices.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9940652847290039
"In these circumstances, I believe, it is appropriate to put greater weight on incoming data to determine whether the stance of monetary policy should be changed.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9938448667526245
"Some of the variables relevant in this regard are: 1) the rate of change in wages or prices or early signs of emerging inflation, 2) the level of the unemployment rate and the pace of job creation, 3) the rate and composition of GDP growth (inventories, trade flows, consumption, investment, residential and commercial construction, and so forth), and 4) international developments.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9944584369659424
"Another set of variables to be considered in making monetary policy are financial variables, such as the money supply, interest rates, exchange rates, credit flows, and conditions in bank lending and in the debt and equity markets.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9934543371200562
"The last two years, 1997 and 1998, gave an interesting case study of the interplay between these different variables and the degree of forward-looking behavior in the making of monetary policy.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9949308037757874
"From March of 1997 through much of 1998, pleasant surprises in the performance of inflation and the general absence of early signs of inflation, and uncertainty about the relationship of changes in inflation to the level of resource utilization, kept the FOMC from tightening.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9946817755699158
We did not tighten despite the economy being beyond most estimates of its potential and despite many forecasts of rising inflation.,1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9937463998794556
"Put another way, the FOMC could have ""preemptively"" tightened monetary policy, based on forecasts, but recognizing the uncertainties about empirical relationships chose not to do so.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.99403977394104
"Indeed, monetary policy was eased in the fall of 1998.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9944144487380981
"Under those circumstances, the FOMC thought it appropriate to ease policy to offset a likely significant impact on future domestic spending and growth.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9934598207473755
"Finally, no discussion of monetary policy and financial markets would be complete without reference to the equity markets.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9928181171417236
"Therefore, equity prices have an influence on business fixed investment, along with household consumption.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9936248064041138
We have seen in other economies that bubbles and busts in financial markets can create unsettled conditions that impair real economic activity.,1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9938680529594421
These are just some of the factors that go into making monetary policy.,1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9932864308357239
"Outlook for 1999 With this general statement of the factors that go into setting monetary policy, let me turn to the outlook for 1999.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9943958520889282
"Real GDP grew more than 4 percent in 1998, on a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis, and maintained that rapid growth into the first quarter of this year.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9946027398109436
"The consensus, as represented by the most recent Blue Chip Economic Indicators, is that growth will be more moderate over the remainder of 1999, but that it will still total nearly 3-1/4 percent or so for the year.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.994772732257843
"The ability of Brazil, with the financial assistance of the international community, to weather its exchange rate crisis as well as it has to date, no doubt, has done much to allay some of the fears that were present in late 1998 and early 1999.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9943355917930603
"Finally, it is simply the case that many economists have come to the realization that they underestimated the underlying strength of domestic demand here in the United States-and the profitability of American businesses in that environment.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9940944314002991
"The strength in corporate profits in the first quarter not only impressed economists, but it also impressed investors, who drove stock prices up earlier this year.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9940967559814453
"That rise, through the effects I noted earlier, should continue to support domestic demand in the months ahead.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9945068955421448
"But, again underscoring an earlier point, this tightness of the labor market has not manifested itself in ongoing escalation of wage inflation.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9930525422096252
"Second, and more fundamentally, it is quite possible that we are seeing a pass-through of the more modest rates of price inflation we have enjoyed in the past couple of years into decisions about nominal wage increases.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9943265318870544
"This is, of course, a very healthy development-one that we hope will be sustained going forward, because it is central to the achievement of ongoing price stability.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9948364496231079
We must recognize that there have been a number of factors behind the favorable price performance we have been experiencing.,1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9926942586898804
"In part, it is due to an increase in productivity, as businesses have invested in high-tech equipment and adjusted the procedures of the workplace to get the greatest benefit from those investments.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9938502311706543
"This allows workers to become more productive and receive higher pay, which businesses need not translate into higher prices in order to remain profitable.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9933004379272461
"Moreover, we have already seen some reversal of some of these factors, most notably the sharp rebound in world oil prices and a surge in health insurance costs.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9935909509658813
"Under the circumstances, we must be concerned that, with the economy operating at such a high level of labor utilization and growth robust, we might be in some jeopardy of setting the stage for a an upturn in inflation.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9931833148002625
"In our announcement after our May 18 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee made it clear that we are watching things very closely and stand prepared to act promptly if the evidence begins to mount that inflationary pressures could be building.",1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9934874773025513
We observe developments in the economy and in financial markets and try to adjust monetary policy to the signals that we receive so that our nation's economic welfare is not threatened by inflation or by growth that persistently falls below the economy's potential.,1999-06-10,TRUST,0.9942242503166199
"Price stability is our responsibility as central banks--it is how, in the long run, we contribute to society's welfare.",2005-05-20,TRUST,0.9935256242752075
Achieving and maintaining price stability will be more efficient and effective the better we understand the causes of inflation and the dynamics of how it evolves.,2005-05-20,TRUST,0.9943515062332153
1 I think central bankers are asking more of inflation analysis these days.,2005-05-20,TRUST,0.9940477609634399
"In the United States, our attention was focused for many years on containing and then reducing inflation.",2005-05-20,TRUST,0.9937141537666321
"The risks and rewards were one-sided, and policymakers were mostly interested in whether inflation would rise.",2005-05-20,TRUST,0.9943593144416809
"Now that we are in the neighborhood of price stability, we can be faced with looking at the possibility that inflation will fall too low as well as rise too high.",2005-05-20,TRUST,0.9942441582679749
"Moreover, so long as inflation expectations are well anchored, we can tolerate limited changes in inflation, but we need to know that a rise or fall is not the beginning of a more extended trend.",2005-05-20,TRUST,0.9935699701309204
"Consequently, we focus closely on the reasons for any changes in inflation and their implications for the outlook.",2005-05-20,TRUST,0.9941344857215881
"Of course, I have always known how important the analysis and forecasting of inflation was for monetary policy, but I must admit that as someone who now has to go on record with a vote on the basis of some notion of the future course of inflation, the exercise has taken on added meaning.",2005-05-20,TRUST,0.9937474727630615
I thought I might take advantage of this captive audience of researchers on central bank policies to ruminate a bit on the evolution of inflation modeling and suggest areas for further research.,2005-05-20,TRUST,0.994954526424408
The Stability of the Basic Framework I find it remarkable how fundamentally stable our basic framework for analyzing inflation has remained over the past thirty-five years or so: That basic framework is essentially the expectations-augmented Phillips curve introduced by Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps in the late 1960s.2 One of the key assumptions underlying this basic framework is the temporary rigidity of wages and prices.,2005-05-20,TRUST,0.9959214925765991
"It is because of these nominal rigidities that monetary shocks have real effects: In the well-known litany, wages and prices do not change immediately in response to a positive monetary surprise, so real interest rates fall, and spending is stimulated.",2005-05-20,TRUST,0.9943994879722595
But higher demand cannot be met without pushing firms up their marginal cost curves as they compete for scarce labor and other resources.,2005-05-20,TRUST,0.9935541152954102
"As opportunities to raise prices present themselves, firms take them to better align prices with costs.",2005-05-20,TRUST,0.9937564134597778
"That process may be gradual, because firms' competitors may not be raising their prices at the same time.",2005-05-20,TRUST,0.9939589500427246
"Expectations are a key part of the framework because wages and prices will be set for some time, and so it is important for workers and firms to consider the economic conditions expected to prevail during the period that the wages and prices are fixed.",2005-05-20,TRUST,0.9938822984695435
"If inflation is anticipated over the period ahead, wages and prices will be set commensurately higher as workers and firms strive to protect themselves against the erosion of their purchasing power.",2005-05-20,TRUST,0.9931960105895996
"As Friedman and Phelps emphasized, these efforts to protect against the erosion of purchasing power by inflation will mean that an ongoing and fully anticipated inflation will, to a first approximation, have no effect on the level of resource utilization; the outcome of the economy will be whatever the real forces at work dictate.",2005-05-20,TRUST,0.9951609969139099
Friedman called the unemployment rate determined by such real factors the natural rate of unemployment.,2005-05-20,TRUST,0.9941331744194031
An important implication of the expectations-augmented Phillips curve is that any attempt to use monetary policy to lower the unemployment rate below the natural rate on a sustained basis will end in failure.,2005-05-20,TRUST,0.9942019581794739
"Initially, expansionary monetary policy would lower unemployment as well as raise inflation.",2005-05-20,TRUST,0.9937210083007812
"As the stimulus continued, however, firms and workers would increasingly protect themselves against the higher inflation, giving an additional boost to inflation.",2005-05-20,TRUST,0.9938740134239197
"Eventually, there would be no additional employment; only a (self-reinforcing) higher rate of inflation.",2005-05-20,TRUST,0.9936227202415466

(via webcast) Share Watch Live Outlooks and Outcomes for the U.S. Economy With the release of the gross domestic product (GDP) data last week, we learned that the U.S. economy in the second quarter of this year transitioned from economic recovery to economic expansion.1 Given the catastrophic collapse in U.S. economic activity in the first half of 2020 as a result of the global pandemic and the mitigation efforts put in place to contain it, few forecasters could have expectedâ€”or even dared to hopeâ€”in the spring of last year that the recovery in GDP, from the sharpest decline in activity since the Great Depression, would be either so robust or as rapid.",2021-08-04,TRUST,0.9951578974723816
"Indeed, just recently, the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating Committee determined that the recession that began in March of last year ended in April, making it not only the deepest recession on record, but also the briefest.2 Moreover, with the development and distribution of several remarkably effective vaccines, the monetary and fiscal policies presently in place should continue to support the strong expansion in economic activity that is expected to be realized this year, although, obviously, the rapid spread of the Delta variant among the still considerable fraction of the population that is unvaccinated is clearly a downside risk for the outlook.",2021-08-04,TRUST,0.9948683977127075
"Importantly, while it is customary in business cycle analysis to date the transition from the recovery phase to the expansion phase according to the calendar quarter in which the level of real GDP first exceeds the previous business cycle's peak, in past U.S. business cycles, the recovery in employment has always lagged the recovery in GDP, and this cycle is no exception.",2021-08-04,TRUST,0.9935585856437683

"Given this outlook and so long as inflation expectations remain well anchored at the 2 percent longer-run goalâ€”which, based on the Fed staff's common inflation expectations (CIE) index, I judge at present to be the case and which I project will remain true over the forecast horizonâ€”commencing policy normalization in 2023 would, under these conditions, be entirely consistent with our new flexible average inflation targeting framework.10 I note that under the June SEP median of modal projections, annualized PCE inflation since the new framework was adopted in August 2020 is projected to average 2.6 percent through year-end 2022 and 2.5 percent through year-end 2023.11 In the context of our new framework, it is important to note that while the ELB can be a constraint on monetary policy, the ELB is not a constraint on fiscal policy, and appropriate monetary policy under our new framework, to me, mustâ€”and certainly canâ€”incorporate this reality.",2021-08-04,TRUST,0.9947785139083862

"With regard to our price-stability mandate, while the new statement maintains our definition that the longer-run goal for inflation is 2 percent, it elevates the importanceâ€”and the challengeâ€”of keeping inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent in a world in which an effective-lower-bound constraint is, in downturns, binding on the federal funds rate.5 To this end, the new statement conveys the Committee's judgment that, in order to anchor expectations at the 2 percent level consistent with price stability, it will conduct policy to achieve inflation outcomes that keep long-run inflation expectations anchored at our 2 percent longer-run goal.",2021-05-12,TRUST,0.9944948554039001

"This problem is not necessarily insuperable; all political actors might recognize the value of price stability and might appreciate inflation targeting, at least in its softer form.",2005-05-26,TRUST,0.9940990209579468
A first place is the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act itself.,2005-05-26,TRUST,0.9943829774856567

"These reports and testimony have been occasions for the Fed to report on concepts and developments, though never one as significant as inflation targeting.",2005-05-26,TRUST,0.9941336512565613
"It is hard to imagine the Fed's using these hearings to announce a full-blown inflation-targeting regime, though it is conceivable that the Fed could use them to propose soft target bands for price stability, or at least to get more specific about the Fed's commitment to price stability.",2005-05-26,TRUST,0.9947797060012817
"But in the end, using the Monetary Policy Reports from the Fed as a means of getting the Congress to endorse inflation targeting would be stretching things.",2005-05-26,TRUST,0.994506299495697
One could imagine a similar process for inflation targeting.,2005-05-26,TRUST,0.9944705963134766
"For the Fed to write rules for a strict inflation-targeting regime on its own would presumably be impossible, though one might interpret ""maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates"" as an invitation for the Fed to write rules to institute a soft form of inflation targeting.",2005-05-26,TRUST,0.9945777654647827

A Fed announcement about inflation targeting would be much more significant than the other more-technical and more-data-oriented announcements or pronouncements the Fed normally gives in its Monetary Policy Reports.,2005-05-26,TRUST,0.993596076965332
"And for the Fed to interpret the broad language of the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act as an invitation to write rules instituting a strict form of inflation targeting would be an extreme stretch, though perhaps not for a soft form of inflation targeting.",2005-05-26,TRUST,0.9944831728935242
"Normative Considerations Granted that there is not much legal precedent for going ahead with inflation targeting on its own, would there be any value in having the Fed start a conversation with the Congress?",2005-05-26,TRUST,0.994785726070404
But what if the Fed were actually to propose a soft form of inflation targeting?,2005-05-26,TRUST,0.9943148493766785
Such a proposal might change the dynamics and raise the possibility that the Congress could at least tacitly endorse inflation targeting.,2005-05-26,TRUST,0.9944965243339539

"The present ""bias"" statement in the Fed's announcement of changes in the federal funds rate target could be supplanted with a statement on whether inflation is tending to the upper or lower bound of the Fed's price stability range.",2005-05-26,TRUST,0.9942354559898376

These discussions might also make it clear that price stability--not all these other matters--is the primary economic outcome for which the Fed is responsible.,2005-05-26,TRUST,0.9937840700149536
A modern-day macroeconomist would have no trouble in understanding why the Fed would put a target band on inflation but not on unemployment and not on long-term interest rates.,2005-05-26,TRUST,0.9940470457077026
"In modern-day macroeconomics, inflation is a policy choice variable--there is essentially no long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, and it is up to monetary policy to choose the long-run rate of inflation.",2005-05-26,TRUST,0.9937613606452942

Keeping inflation close to zero has the further advantage of limiting the microeconomic costs and tax distortions caused by inflation.,2005-05-26,TRUST,0.9934219717979431

"As evidence, one could use the 1960s and 1970s as dramatic indications of what happens when macro policy violates the natural unemployment rate rule and the equilibrium interest rate rule, with rather dire subsequent inflationary consequences.",2005-05-26,TRUST,0.9941614270210266

Similar conversations might have occurred in all those countries where the government seems to have eagerly adopted inflation targeting.,2005-05-26,TRUST,0.9937283992767334
"But these attempts to explain inflation targeting still might not work, and the Congress might still delineate specific unemployment and interest rate goals along with inflation goals.",2005-05-26,TRUST,0.9937151074409485
"Were such to be the case, particularly if the specific goals for unemployment or interest rates were set inappropriately, as was done in the Humphrey-Hawkins Act of the late 1970s, I believe that even die-hard advocates of inflation targeting would consider the costs greater than the benefits.",2005-05-26,TRUST,0.9940028786659241

Most experts and others interested in inflation targeting understand this need for flexibility and are quite comfortable with flexible inflation-targeting schemes.,2005-05-26,TRUST,0.994694173336029

They are also likely to push up prices in other energy markets.,2004-09-16,TRUST,0.99342280626297

"One approach, often associated with James Hamilton, measures the reduced-form correlation between oil price movements and subsequent movements in unemployment, or output gaps.1 Such an analysis is shown in figure 1, which compares aggregate real oil prices with a measure of the overall output gap.2 The figure shows that since 1973 every upward spike in real oil prices has been followed by a jump in the output gap.",2004-09-16,TRUST,0.9942601919174194

"When one does all this, as many economists are doing these days, one sees effects of about one-third of 1 percent on unemployment and slightly more for core inflation rates for a permanent shock in the price of oil of $10 a barrel.3 With appropriate transformations, these structural effects appear to be a good bit smaller than the implications of the reduced-form correlations.",2004-09-16,TRUST,0.995465874671936
